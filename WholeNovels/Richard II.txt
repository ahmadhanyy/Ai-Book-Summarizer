Michael Witmore

Director, Folger Shakespeare Library

It is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their
composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems
have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to
make them their own.

Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process
of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings
in language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,
new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a
mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds.
These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource
for study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic
texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The
Folger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a
trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.

The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis
for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their
origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the
single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An
unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and
artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been
consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions
also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of
Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.

I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul
Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s
works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a
richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers
who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow
the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the
Folger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and
digital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I
commend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.

From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare

Library

Until now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly
Folger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of
Shakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the
Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of
the plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that
there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But
Shakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or
plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some
cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published
versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great
collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First
Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of
Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others.
Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then
amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other
versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate
text.

Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an
unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the
period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that
made it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred
years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on
cultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,
for example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda
to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The
Tempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not
take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare
editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her
father, Prospero.

The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long
before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to
make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The
Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger
Shakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly
transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,
which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger
Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial
interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from
Othello: “ If she in chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square
brackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood  and sword and
fire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from

Textual Introduction

By Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine

Hamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier.  Who hath relieved/you?”). At
any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for
more information.

Because the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with
twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger
here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,
and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the
plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study
and enjoyment of Shakespeare.

In Richard II, anger at a king’s arbitrary rule leads to his downfall—
and sets in motion a decades-long struggle for the crown that
continues in several more history plays.

Richard II begins as Richard’s cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, charges
Thomas Mowbray with serious crimes, including the murder of the
Duke of Gloucester. Bolingbroke’s father, John of Gaunt, privately
blames the king for Gloucester’s death. At Richard’s command,
Bolingbroke and Mowbray prepare for a trial by combat. The king
halts the fight at the last minute, banishing both men from England.

When John of Gaunt dies, Richard seizes his possessions to help
finance a war in Ireland, thus dispossessing Bolingbroke.
Bolingbroke returns to England, quickly gathering support. By the
time Richard returns from Ireland, many of his former allies have
joined Bolingbroke. Richard abdicates, yielding the crown to
Bolingbroke.

Richard is held at Pomfret Castle and Bolingbroke becomes King
Henry IV. A murder plot against him is uncovered and stopped.
Richard is murdered by a follower of Henry.

 Further I say, and further will maintain
 Upon his bad life to make all this good,
 That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death,
 Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
 And consequently, like a traitor coward,
 Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of

 blood,

 Which blood, like sacrificing Abel’s, cries
 Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
 To me for justice and rough chastisement.
 And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
 This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.

 In some large measure to thy father’s death
 In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
 Who was the model of thy father’s life.
 Call it not patience, Gaunt. It is despair.
 In suff’ring thus thy brother to be slaughtered,
 Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
 Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.
 That which in mean men we entitle patience
 Is pale, cold cowardice in noble breasts.
 What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life,
 The best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death.

 Of civil wounds plowed up with neighbor’s sword;
 And for we think the eagle-wingèd pride
 Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
 With rival-hating envy, set on you
 To wake our peace, which in our country’s cradle
 Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep,
 Which, so roused up with boist’rous untuned

 drums,

 With harsh resounding trumpets’ dreadful bray,
 And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
 Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
 And make us wade even in our kindred’s blood:
 Therefore we banish you our territories.

 Till twice five summers have enriched our fields
 Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
 But tread the stranger paths of banishment.

 Feared by their breed and famous by their birth,
 Renownèd for their deeds as far from home
 For Christian service and true chivalry
 As is the sepulcher in stubborn Jewry
 Of the world’s ransom, blessèd Mary’s son,
 This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
 Dear for her reputation through the world,
 Is now leased out—I die pronouncing it—
 Like to a tenement or pelting farm.
 England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
 Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
 Of wat’ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
 With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds.
 That England that was wont to conquer others
 Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
 Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
 How happy then were my ensuing death!

 O, had thy grandsire with a prophet’s eye
 Seen how his son’s son should destroy his sons,
 From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
 Deposing thee before thou wert possessed,
 Which art possessed now to depose thyself.
 Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
 It were a shame to let this land by lease;
 But, for thy world enjoying but this land,
 Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
 Landlord of England art thou now, not king.
 Thy state of law is bondslave to the law,
 And thou—

   A lunatic lean-witted fool,

 Presuming on an ague’s privilege,
 Darest with thy frozen admonition
 Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
 With fury from his native residence.
 Now, by my seat’s right royal majesty,
 Wert thou not brother to great Edward’s son,
 This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
 Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.

 Call in the letters patents that he hath

 Com’st thou because the anointed king is hence?
 Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind
 And in my loyal bosom lies his power.

 As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself
 Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
 From forth the ranks of many thousand French,

 Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee

 You have misled a prince, a royal king,
 A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments
 By you unhappied and disfigured clean.
 You have in manner with your sinful hours
 Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
 Broke the possession of a royal bed,
 And stained the beauty of a fair queen’s cheeks
 With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
 Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
 Near to the King in blood, and near in love
 Till you did make him misinterpret me,
 Have stooped my neck under your injuries
 And sighed my English breath in foreign clouds,
 Eating the bitter bread of banishment,

 And that small model of the barren earth
 Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.

 And tell sad stories of the death of kings—
 How some have been deposed, some slain in war,
 Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,
 Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping killed,
 All murdered. For within the hollow crown
 That rounds the mortal temples of a king
 Keeps Death his court, and there the antic sits,
 Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
 Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
 To monarchize, be feared, and kill with looks,
 Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
 As if this flesh which walls about our life
 Were brass impregnable; and humored thus,
 Comes at the last and with a little pin
 Bores through his castle wall, and farewell, king!
 Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood
 With solemn reverence. Throw away respect,
 Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,
 For you have but mistook me all this while.

 Taste grief, need friends. Subjected thus,

 That from this castle’s tottered battlements

 Of fire and water when their thund’ring shock
 At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
 Be he the fire, I’ll be the yielding water;
 The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
 My waters—on the earth and not on him.

 Can gripe the sacred handle of our scepter,
 Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.

 And we are barren and bereft of friends,
 Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
 Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
 Armies of pestilence, and they shall strike
 Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
 That lift your vassal hands against my head
 And threat the glory of my precious crown.
 Tell Bolingbroke—for yon methinks he stands—
 That every stride he makes upon my land
 Is dangerous treason. He is come to open
 The purple testament of bleeding war;
 But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
 Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers’ sons
 Shall ill become the flower of England’s face,
 Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
 To scarlet indignation, and bedew
 Her pastures’ grass with faithful English blood.

 That stands upon your royal grandsire’s bones,
 And by the royalties of both your bloods,
 Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
 And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
 And by the worth and honor of himself,
 Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
 His coming hither hath no further scope
 Than for his lineal royalties, and to beg
 Enfranchisement immediate on his knees;
 Which on thy royal party granted once,
 His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
 His barbèd steeds to stables, and his heart
 To faithful service of your Majesty.
 This swears he, as he is a prince and  just,
 And as I am a gentleman I credit him.

  Why, York, what wilt thou do?

 Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
 Have we more sons? Or are we like to have?
 Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
 And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age
 And rob me of a happy mother’s name?
 Is he not like thee? Is he not thine own?

  Thou fond mad woman,

 Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
 A dozen of them here have ta’en the sacrament
 And interchangeably set down their hands
 To kill the King at Oxford.

 Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
 And so I am; then crushing penury
 Persuades me I was better when a king.
 Then am I kinged again, and by and by
 Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke,
 And straight am nothing. But whate’er I be,
 Nor I nor any man that but man is
 With nothing shall be pleased till he be eased
 With being nothing.  (The music plays.) Music do I

 hear?

 Ha, ha, keep time! How sour sweet music is
 When time is broke and no proportion kept.
 So is it in the music of men’s lives.
 And here have I the daintiness of ear
 To check time broke in a disordered string;
 But for the concord of my state and time
 Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
 I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
 For now hath time made me his numb’ring clock.
 My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar
 Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
 Whereto my finger, like a dial’s point,
 Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears.
 Now, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
 Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,
 Which is the bell. So sighs and tears and groans
 Show minutes, times, and hours. But my time
 Runs posting on in Bolingbroke’s proud joy,
 While I stand fooling here, his jack of the clock.
 This music mads me. Let it sound no more,
 For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
 In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
 Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me,
 For ’tis a sign of love, and love to Richard
 Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

 That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow.
 Come mourn with me for what I do lament,
 And put on sullen black incontinent.

 To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.

 March sadly after. Grace my mournings here
 In weeping after this untimely bier.
