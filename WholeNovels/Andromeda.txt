Glossary 

F r o m the A u t h o r * 

I receive numerous letters from readers 
seeking answers to various questions about 
me: how I started on my literary career, how 
I combine science and writing, how I work on 
my science fiction, who is my literary hero, 
what I think of the future, etc. 

In this introduction I shall try to reply to 
some of the most typical questions. 

Legend and Reality 

Is it true, people ask, that I fought against 
the Whites in the Civil War, or that I was a 
boxer and a sea captain? I'm afraid all this is 
pure fabrication. I was not a captain but a

sailor. I did not fight at all, but was accepted 
as a boy into a motor transport company in 
the 6th 
Red Army during the Civil War. 
I never made it as a boxer. How did I become a 
sailor? Through books. My childhood is in-
separable from the works of travellers and 
adventure-story 
writers—books 
of 
active 
romanticism, as I call them. 

My Start in Science 

Soon after the end of the Civil War I moved 
to Leningrad. I was faced with the prospect 
of 
completing 
my 
secondary 
education, 
which had been interrupted by the war, and, 
most important of all, working out what I 
was going to do with my life. One day I hap-
pened on an article in a 1922 issue of the 
journal Priroda (Nature), in which the distin-
guished Soviet palaeontologist Academician 
Pyotr Sushkin described some land animals 
found in Permian deposits along the northern 
stretches of the Northern Dvina River. 

The author's powerful mind reconstruct-
ed a big river which had flowed here two 
million centuries ago, brought to life a whole 
world of strange animals inhabiting its banks, 
revealed to the reader boundless expanses 
of time, fascinating scientific enigmas... I 
wrote to the academician, expressing interest 
in palaeontology, and he responded to my let-
ter with remarkable solicitude. He invited me 
to call on him, provided me with books on 
the subject and allowed me to visit the museum 
where, under his guidance, I began to learn 
about the great history of Earth and life. 

Having passed the appropriate exams in na-
vigation, I began to serve my first term at 
sea that summer—in the Soviet Far East and 
on the Caspian Sea. But I wanted to continue 
my studies and entered the biology depart-
ment of Leningrad University's physics and 
mathematics faculty. For a long time I was 
racked by doubts, torn between the two 
vocations—of sailor and scientist. While serv-
ing on the Caspian Sea, I received a telegram 
from Academician Sushkin inviting me to 
work for him at the Academy of Sciences, 
starting with the lowest scientific ranking of 
laboratory technical assistant. Without further 
hesitation I accepted the offer and cast my 
lot in with science once and for all. 

For the next few years I spent my summers 
travelling round various parts of the Soviet 
Union and my winters helping to process ma-
terial. 
I became an "excavation 
hunter". 
Good fortune accompanied me and enabled 
me to make many interesting discoveries in 
the forests and swamps of the North, in the 
gloom and silence of old Ural mine workings, 
in the mountains and sultry steppes of Central 
Asia. I gained experience and my egoistic 
youth began to draw to an end. I was develop-
ing a feeling of duty towards my country 
and people. At that time it was impossible 
not to be enthralled by the titanic efforts 
of the Soviet people to establish an advanced 
industry 
and 
technology 
in 
the 
shortest 
possible time. One science that had a major 
role to play in the achievement of this objec-
tive was geology. I left the University, graduat-

ed from the Leningrad Mining Institute and 
started on geological research in Central Asia, 
Siberia, Yakutia and the Soviet Far East. 
The hard work involved provided an excellent 
school of experience for both science and 
life. The Cambrian deposits of Aldan, the 
gneisses of 
Eastern Siberia, the Mesozoic 
formations of the Far East were a far cry 
from the upper-Paleozoic era and its life— 
those general aspects of historical geology 
and palaeontology to which I had decided to 
devote myself. However, my scientific hori-
zons and travelling experience were growing 
wider and wider. 

Several years later I returned to my work 
in palaeontology and became head of a labo-
ratory 
studying ancient land animals and 
deposits of Paleozoic continents. My teacher, 
Academician Sushkin, had died and it was up 
to me, a man possessing neither his talent nor 
his knowledge, to replace him. My life now 
underwent a difficult 
period of assiduous 
study and settled existence, and I often expe-
rienced acute attacks of the old wanderlust. 
My traveller's soul could not reconcile itself 
to the confinement of academic life. It was 
then that I felt the urge to write—not just 
another scientific article, but to recall and 
tell people about an explorer's work, about 
the harsh struggle with nature. Several times 
I attempted something along the lines of a 
traveller's diary, but these literary sketches 
seemed dull and my descriptions of nature-
pale 
and 
insipid. 
Disappointment 
in 
my 
literary capabilities halted any further endeav-

ours. In addition, I was too busy with other 
things to find much time to write; I had no 
chance to get away from my 
immediate 
environment and view it through the eyes of 
an artist. 

Writers' Intuition and Scientists' Intuition? 

My next literary attempts came much lat-
er—in the course of a serious illness during 
the Second World War. I imagined I would be 
doing a good job if I could write something 
about 
the 
life 
of 
explorers—about 
their 
dreams and work in the name of science. 
At that time there were hardly any literary 
works being published on this theme. 

My first stories, published in 1944, were 
well received by readers and I decided to keep 
on writing, trying to combine it with my 
scientific work. 

There is such a thing as "scientists' intui-
tion". A problem you have been mulling over 
may suddenly be solved by pure conjecture. 
But then you have to collect all the necessary 
arguments and facts to support your solution. 
You proceed, as it were, in reverse—from 
summit to starting point. But sometimes the 
facts are not available to prove your case. 
And then you have to shelve your hypothe-
sis in the hope that the missing links in the 
factual chain will eventually be found. 

Such moments of helplessness serve to 
remind the scientist of the advantages the 
science-fiction writer possesses. 
If an idea 
dawns on him, he can write a novel or story 
presenting as a reality the most daring hypo-

thesis or vision. I wanted to assert and sub-
stantiate some important ideas that inspired 
my literary endeavours. 

Thus, in a story called "Diamond Funnel", 
published in 1944, I advanced the hypothesis 
that there were diamonds on the Siberian pla-
teau and that they lay not in reefs, but in 
funnels—as in South Africa. I knew Siberia 
well and believed that diamonds must exist 
there—and on the Siberian plateau, in partic-
ular. At the time this idea would have been 
too 
fantastic 
for 
scientific 
publications. 
But later "explosion tubes" full of diamonds 
were actually found there. Or to take another 
example: in 1930, when I was still an impu-
dent, newly graduated "pup", I wrote an 
article about plans to take rock samples 
from the ocean floor. I sent it off to an au-
thoritative 
international 
journal 
and soon 
received an equally authoritative 
reply—to 
the effect that the ocean floor was even all 
over and covered with loose deposits, and 
therefore the idea of taking rock samples 
was a mere chimera. Now that such samples 
have become everyday practice, one can sit 
back and laugh at that verdict, but in those 
days there was no avenue for such schemes 
except science fiction. 

The Specific Nature o f Science Fiction 

Even the way an idea for a novel or story 
is born sets us writers of fantasy apart from 
those in other genres. One often hears authors 
say that a particular literary work was in-
spired by some image, or situation drawn 

from 
life or even just some detail which 
suddenly impressed them. 

In this respect writers of fantasy have a 
much harder time. We can only see our "real 
objects" in our imagination. For, as a rule, 
they relate to a future (or past) which is 
sometimes infinitely removed from the pre-
sent day. Therefore our stimulus to literary 
creativity is always provided by long and in-
tense reflection of the basic tendencies of his-
torical development. 

This serious approach to the genre of 
science fiction is the only one I acknowledge. 
If a writer sits down with pen in hand simply 
because he has a sudden urge to indulge in 
fantasy, and imagines that this is easy because 
it is not suject to any apparent control, 
the result will 
be not fantasy, but mere 
fancy—sheer fabrication that has nothing in 
common with real literature. 

I should also point out that science fic-
tion differs from other genres in the degree 
to which an original conception can undergo 
changes. Well-known writers have testified 
to cases where the final written 
product 
is quite different from the original concep-
tion. With me this is out of the question. 
For the specific nature of science fiction 
forces one to define one's object of study 
with absolute precision right from the very 
start. 

Man of the Distant Future 

The characters of my novels differ con-
siderably from those in literary works based 

on present-day life, and even from characters 
created by other writers of fantasy. First 
and foremost, they are people of the distant 
future; they are people of a higher stage in 
a centuries-old communist society. 

There can be no doubt that the man of 
the future ought to differ considerably from 
his present-day counterpart, particularly in his 
upbringing and the sum total of his knowl-
edge. Consequently a writer of fantasy is ob-
liged, first and foremost, to reveal something 
new, to express his own opinion about the 
man of the future. These people are the 
product of a completely different society. 
Their woes are not our woes, their joys are 
not our joys. They may occasionally appear 
to be incomprehensible, weird, even unna-
tural. But it's not worth getting worried about 
this, what is important is to avoid creating 
formless characters. 

Usually writers have real prototypes for 
their characters. Mine have none. Indeed, who 
could they possibly resemble in real life? 
There can be no question of them having 
prototypes in the sense that Tolstoy's War 
and Peace or Gorky's novel Mother had proto-
types. I must create my characters in the 
real sense of the word. Admittedly, some 
remote prototypes do exist. I have some-
times 
found 
myself 
mentally 
comparing 
occasional 
traits 
of 
people 
I know 
with 
those of characters in a proposed novel. 
Sometimes this has helped me to visualise a 
character more clearly, to throw him into 
greater relief. 

A Literary Artist at Heart 

It is very difficult to visualise or imagine 
the distant future. To some it may even 
appear impossible. But I can visualize both 
my characters and all my scenes down to the 
smallest 
details 
in 
quite 
bold 
shapes—as 
something real and actually existing. 

This ability of mine only developed grad-
ually, in the course of many years. During 
my travels I got into the habit of daydream-
ing. This happened, for instance, in the Gobi 
desert. Visions would arise before my eyes 
that were not so much mirages as scenes 
resulting from the play of my imagination-
weird and unusual scenes, to be sure, but 
quite real at the same time. 

I have a strongly developed visual memory. 
Sometimes landscapes which I saw long ago 
arise in my memory as easily as if I had 
seen them only yesterday. When I was explor-
ing the outbacks of Siberia, where no scien-
tist had previously set foot, I would memorise 
many landscapes and then, where possible, 
write down exact descriptions of them in 
my diaries or expedition reports. 

I also acquired the habit of engaging in 
long and scrupulous reflection over what I 
had seen. Sometimes I would picture in my 
memory the different areas I had traversed— 
comparing them and, as it were, superimpos-
ing them one upon another. In this way I 
developed my visual memory, my ability to 
recreate visually very complex scenes. 

In my writing I proceed from visual images 
rather than words. I must first visualize a 

hero (with all his or her movements and 
gestures), a scene, a detail of a spaceship, 
or a landscape on an unknown planet, and 
then try to write it all down. In other words, 
the process is the same as what I employed in 
my geological work. But in this case what I 
see are images and landscapes created by my 
imagination, which I record using resources 
of the art of writing. 

The Invaluable Role of Fantasy 

I am sometimes asked what role fantasy 
can play in anticipating scientific discovery. 
I would formulate it as follows: fantasy re-
flects 
mankind's 
rejection 
of 
utilitarian 
thought by revitalising ideas of the popula-
rization of science. 

Science is branching out and our knowledge 
is becoming more and more fragmented. Some 
problems and theories are so narrow in scope 
that they require an electronic microscope 
to view them. The edifice of the world, which 
was once integral, is now splintered into 
fragments, and specific disciplines are not 
capable of explaining the world: they are 
ceasing to comprehend it. There is a need for 
scientific encyclopaedists. 

But what advantages do they have over 
other scientists? Their advantages lie in their 
broad approach to profoundly specific con-
ceptions 
and 
purely 
scientific 
problems; 
in their readiness to answer any questions. 

Science fiction at its best is no less encyclo-
paedic. Therefore, like a scientist researching 
a wide field of knowledge, it can serve to 

crystallise an idea from a gigantic mountain 
of conglomerated scientific facts, which most 
scientists 
cannot 
see their 
way 
through. 
Whereas the major scientist is inclined to 
delve straight into this mountain and try to 
lay a road through it, the science-fiction 
writer simply scrambles up to its top and then 
looks down to disclose what lies beyond 
its crest. 

But can fantasy give "advice on particular 
branches of science"? Indeed it can. It might 
be recalled, for instance, that not only did 
science fiction predict the advent of the sub-
marine, the aeroplane and television (all this 
is in its distant past), but it is actively helping 
scientists working on the problems of lasers, 
quasers, 
robots, 
wireless 
transmission 
of 
matter and so on. 

Does science fiction help to explain the 
universe? Indeed it does. In fact in this and 
other fields it plays an invaluable role. But in 
laying claim to this role, science fiction must 
meet one essential demand: it must be clever-
ly written, and not simply indulge in a futile 
search for groundless fabrication. 

Contacts with Other Civilisations 

Are there any limits to our search for 
other living, intellectual beings in the uni-
verse? Barely having conceived the Androme-
da Nebula I discovered that my aspirations 
were unwittingly carrying me further. Indeed, 
who is not excited by the idea of other, non-
terrestrial, forms of existence? 

I cannot imagine the long-term develop-

ment of mankind without ventures into space 
or contact with other civilisations. All claims 
to the effect that we will not be able to 
understand civilisations that have arisen on 
other planets in different conditions seem to 
me to be quite groundless. They 
usually 
ignore one very important law: the universe 
is built according to the same plan, from the 
same bricks or elements, with the same 
properties and cause-and-effect relationships. 

Consciousness, 
thought 
and 
intellectual 
matter throughout the universe are structured 
in accordance with these laws and, in as much 
as they originate from them, represent their 
product and reflection. 

Therefore we would definitely understand 
each other's minds; we cannot fail to. As 
far as the sphere of emotions and the field 
of art are concerned, contact will probably 
not be easy at first. I believe that the initial 
intercourse and mutual understanding will 
proceed principally along a scientific and 
technological line. And only then will we and 
our non-terrestrial brothers rise to progres-
sively higher levels of mutual understanding 
in the sphere of emotions. 

The key to first acquaintance with non-
terrestrial intellectual beings lies first and 
foremost in the use of tele-, radio- or other 
fundamentally new kinds of wave oscillations. 

Besides, I am sure that we will find a way 
round the gulf of space and time. There are 
already certain 
indications to 
this 
effect 
in science—for 
instance, the discovery 
of 
tachions, 
particles 
possessing speeds close 

to that of light. 

I have no doubt that we Earth men will 
find other paths into the Universe. And then 
even the most distant stellar civilizations will 
be only a stone's throw away from us. 

What I Expect f r o m the Conquest of Space 

I expect a better understanding of things 
on Earth. What is the aim of science anyway, 
if not to further human happiness? If science, 
or any other activity, does not increase the 
share of happiness and reduce that of suf-
fering, what is the point of it? No, only 
science, in conjunction with all other kinds 
of rational activity, is capable of elucidating 
the impact being produced on us by the blind 
laws of nature, of sizing up these effects and 
correctly transforming them. 

Andromeda 
was written in 1956. Before the 
novel's serial publication in magazine form 
had even been completed artificial satellites 
were already circling the Earth. Subsequent 
editions were followed by man's first entry 
into space and even his first steps on the 
Moon. In the face of these incontrovertible 
facts I realized with delight that the ideas 
forming the basis of the novel were correct. 
But the wondrously rapid fulfilment of the 
dream nurtured by Andromeda 
confronted 
me with the following question: how accu-
rate are the novel's predictions of future 
historical events? Even while I was still in the 
process of writing it, I kept changing the 
novel's 
chronological 
setting, 
bringing 
it 
back a thousand years closer to our own era. 

Marvelling at the credibility of my pictures 
of the future, numerous readers have asked 
me: do I really believe so unreservedly in the 
inevitable triumph of communist principles 
of building society? After all, there are so 
many dangers lying in store for us on this 
road, we have a long way to go before we 
arrive at a wise and superior stage of commu-
nism embracing the entire planet, and the 
pitfalls along it 
are 
huge and menacing. 

My answer is simple. It is my deepest 
conviction that only a higher form of human 
existence can save mankind from inevitable 
destruction 
(for 
the 
brutalization 
of 
our 
delicate world is equivalent to destruction). 
This inspires me with faith that there can 
be no other future—unless, of course, we are 
to have no future at all! I am not interested 
in depicting the total destruction of 
our 
planet, for that amounts to nothing more 
than a final plunge into darkness, the end of 
3 thousand-million-year 
chain 
of 
develop-
ment—in other words, nothing at all. 

That is why I only acknowledge and des-
cribe the concept of a happy future, for it 
will be that or nothing. Hence my unwavering 
faith in the inevitability of communism over 
the entire planet; hence the convincing way 
that I portrayed this society. 

What Would I Tell My Grandchildren About the Future? 

I would tell them: no attempt to probe in-
to future is futile—regardless of whether it 
be undertaken with book in hand, in a friend-
ly discussion, or in complete solitude under a 

starry sky. But be prepared to be tried and 
tested; I do not imagine that your future 
will be a particularly easy one. Psychological-
ly it will probably be harder for you than 
our time was for us. 

I remember my own childhood and youth, 
when I was drawn by the magical contours 
of distant lands, entranced by the mysteries 
of Africa and the jungles of the Amazon, 
when I only had to fall asleep to immediate-
ly find myself on the banks of some exotic 
river, where gigantic crocodiles rose out of 
the turbid waters, and elephants trumpeted, 
and majestic lions turned their heads towards 
the rising sun. Back then nobody had yet 
penetrated the ocean depths. Back then I 
never even dreamed of viewing Earth from 
outer space, or flying to the Moon or other 
planets. 

I remember how, with trembling fingers, 
I used to manipulate my crystal radio set, 
never ceasing to wonder how music could is-
sue forth from such a collection of metal 
and screws. During my Siberian travels I 
journeyed by horse, by sledge and by post-
chaise. Yet today young people use space 
flight imagery with reckless abandon. I have 
yet to live to a hundred, but even in my life-
time I have sampled the varied pleasures of 
horse-back, 
steam-engine 
and 
jet 
plane. 

All these changes have had an enormous 
impact on the world. It has shrivelled like 
a punctured football; it has become com-
monplace and familiar. There are hardly any 
more mysteries which recede beyond the 

horizon 
when 
we approach 
them. Those 
which remain lie deeper than those we have 
unfolded. 

It will be your lot to penetrate into the 
depths of matter with the aid of vast Cyclo-
pean machines, to forge your way into the 
jungle of Earth's crust, to make landings on 
distant planets. Do not be sad that the dear 
old romance of the undiscovered Earth has 
vanished. It has been replaced by a romance 
which demands much greater exertion, much 
more preparation, both psychological and 
physical—the romance of probing the deep 
mysteries of 
knowledge, the romance of 
saving nature, of ridding mankind from suffer-
ing. 

Be prepared to be tried and tested. And 
may 
you succeed in entering the 
Great 
Circle of the Future.

Chapter One 

T H E I R O N STAR 

In the faint light emitted by the helical 
tube on the ceiling the rows of dials on the 
instrument 
panels looked 
like a portrait 
gallery—the round dials had jovial faces, the 
recumbent oval physiognomies were impu-
dently self-satisfied and the square mugs were 
immobile 
in 
their 
stupid 
complacency. 
The light- and dark-blue, orange and green 
lights flickering inside the instruments served 
to intensify the impression. 

A big dial, glowing dull red, gazed out from 
the middle of the convex control desk. The 
girl in front of it had forgotten her chair and 
stood with her head bowed uncomfortably 
towards it, her brow almost touching the 
glass. The red glow made her youthful face 
older and sterner, cast clear-cut shadows 

round her full lips and even made her slight-
ly snub nose look pointed. Her thick eye-
brows, knitted in a frown, looked jet black 
in that light and gave her eyes the expression 
of despair seen in the eyes of the doomed. 

The faint hum of the meters was interrupt-
ed by a soft 
metallic click. The girl started 
and raised her head, straightening her tired 
back. 

The door opened behind her, a big shadow 
appeared and turned into a man with abrupt 
and precise movements. A flood of golden 
light sprang up, making the girl's thick, 
dark-auburn hair sparkle like gold. She turned 
to the newcomer with a look that told both 
of her love for him and of her anxiety. 

"Why 
aren't 
you sleeping? A 
hundred 
sleepless hours!" 

" A bad example, eh?" There was a note 
of gaiety in his voice but he did not smile; 
it was a voice marked by high metallic notes 
that seemed to rivet his words together. 

"The others are all asleep," the girl began 
timidly, "and ... don't 
know 
anything..." 
she added whispering instinctively. 

"Don't be afraid to speak. Everybody else 
is asleep, we're the only two awake in the 
Cosmos and it's fifty billion1 * kilometres 
to Earth—a mere parsec2 and a half!" 

"And we've got fuel for just one accele-
ration!" There was fascinated horror in the 
girl's exclamation.

In two rapid strides Erg Noor, Commander 
of Cosmic Expedition No. 37, reached the 
glowing dial. 

"The fifth circle!" 
"Yes, we've entered the fifth ... and ... still 
nothing." The girl cast an eloquent glance 
at the loudspeaker of the automatic receiver. 

"So obviously 
I have no right to sleep 
with so many variants and possibilities to stu-
dy. A solution must be found by the end of 
the fifth circle." 

"But 
that's 
another 
hundred and 
ten 
hours." 

"All right, I'll go to sleep in the armchair 
here as soon as the effect of the sporamin3 

wears off. I took it twenty-four hours ago." 

The girl stood deep in thought for a time 
but at last decided to speak. 

"Perhaps we should decrease the radius 
of 
the circle? 
Suppose something's 
gone 
wrong with their transmitter?" 

"Certainly not! If you reduce the radius 
without reducing speed you'll break up the 
ship. If you reduce speed you'll be left with-
out anameson4... with a parsec and a half 
to go at the speed of the ancient lunar rockets! 
At that rate we'd get somewhere near our 
solar system in about a hundred thousand 
years." 

"I know that. But couldn't they..." 
"No, 
they 
couldn't. 
Aeons ago people 
could be careless or could deceive each other 
and themselves. But not today!" 

"That's not what I wanted to say." The 
sharpness of her retort showed that the girl 

was offended. "I was going to say that At-
grab may have deviated from its course look-
ing for us." 

" I t 
couldn't 
have deviated so much. It 
must 
have left at the time computed and 
agreed on. If the improbable had happened 
and both transmitters had been put out of 
action it would have had to cross the circle 
diametrically and we should have heard it 
on the planetary receiver. There's no possi-
bility of a mistake—there it is, the rendez-
vous planet." 

Erg Noor pointed to the mirror screens in 
deep niches on all four sides of the control 
tower. Countless stars burned in the pro-
found blackness. A tiny grey disc, barely 
illuminated by its sun very far away from 
them, from the outer edge of the system 
B-7336-S + 87-A, flashed across the forward 
port screen. 

"Our 
bomb stations5 
are working well 
although we put them up four independent 
years6 ago." Erg Noor pointed to a clear-
cut line of light running along a glass panel 
that stretched the whole length of the left-
hand wall. "A/grab 
should have been here 
three months ago. That means," Erg Noor 
hesitated as though he did not wish to finish 
the sentence, "A/grab is lost!" 

"But suppose it isn't, suppose it has only 
been damaged by a meteoroid and cannot 
regain its speed?" objected the auburn-haired 
girl. 

"Cannot regain its speed!" repeated Erg 
Noor. "Isn't that the same thing? If there is 

a journey thousands of years long between 
the ship and its goal, so much the worse— 
instead of 
instantaneous death there will 
be years of hopelessness for the doomed. 
Perhaps they will call. 
If they do, we'll 
know ... on Earth ... at about six years' time." 

With one of his impetuous 
movements 
Erg Noor pulled a folding armchair from un-
der the table of the electronic computer, 
a little MNU-11; the ITU electronic brain 
that could make any computation was not fit-
ted in spaceships to pilot them unaided on 
account of its great weight, size and fragility. 
A navigator had always to be on duty in the 
control tower, especially as it was impossible 
to plot an exact course over such terrific 
distances. 

The commander's hands flashed over the 
levers and buttons with the rapidity of a 
pianist's. The clear-cut features of his pale 
face were as immobile as those of a statue 
and his lofty brow, inclined stubbornly over 
the control desk, seemed to be challenging 
the elemental forces that menaced that tiny 
world of living beings who had dared pene-
trate into the forbidden depths of space. 

Nisa Creet, a young astronavigator on her 
first cosmic expedition, held her breath as 
she watched Erg Noor in silence, and the com-
mander himself seemed oblivious of every-
thing but his work. How cool and collected, 
how clever and full of energy was the man she 
loved. And she had loved him for a long tirm, 
for the whole of the five years. There was no 
sense in hiding it from him, he knew it al-

ready, Nisa could feel that. Now that this 
great misfortune had happened she had the 
tremendous joy of serving a watch with him, 
three months alone with him while the other 
members of the crew lay in deep hypnotic 
sleep. Another thirteen days and they, too, 
would be able to sleep for six months while 
the 
other 
two 
watches—the 
navigators, 
astronomers 
and 
mechanics—served 
their 
turns. The other members of the expedition, 
the biologists and geologists who would only 
have work to do when they arrived at their 
destination, could sleep longer, but the astro-
nomers—oh! theirs was the greatest strain of 
all. 

Erg Noor got up from his seat and Nisa's 
train of thought was broken. 

"I'm 
going 
to 
the 
charthouse. 
You'll 
be able to sleep in..." he looked at the clock 
showing dependent, or ship's, time, "nine 
hours. I'll have time for some sleep before I 
relieve you." 

"I'm not tired, I can stay here as long as 
is 
necessary—you 
must 
get 
some 
rest!" 

Erg Noor frowned and wanted to object 
but was captivated by the tenderness of her 
words and by the golden hazel eyes that 
appealed to him so trustingly; he smiled and 
went cut without another word. 

Nisa sat down in the chair, cast an accus-
tomed glance over the instruments and was 
soon lost in deep meditation. 

The reflector screens through which those 
in the control tower could see what was 
happening in the space surrounding the ship 

gleamed black overhead. The lights of diffe-
rently coloured stars pierced the eyes like 
needles of fire. 

The spaceship was overtaking a planet and 
its pull made the ship vacillate in a gravitation 
field of changing intensity. The magnificent 
but malignant stars also made wild leaps in 
the reflector screens. The outlines of the con-
stellations changed with a rapidity that the 
memory could not register. 

Planet K2-2N-88, cold, lifeless, far from 
its sun, was known as a convenient rendezvous 
for spaceships ... for the meeting that had not 
taken 
place. The 
fifth 
circle—Nisa 
could 
picture her ship travelling with reduced speed 
around a monster circle with a radius of a 
thousand million kilometres and constantly 
gaining on a planet that crawled at tortoise 
speed. In a hundred and ten hours the ship 
would complete the fifth circle—and what 
then? Erg Noor's tremendous brain was now 
strained to the utmost to find the best solu-
tion. As commander both of the expedition 
and the ship he could not make mistakes for 
if he did First Class Spaceship Tantra with its 
crew of the world's most eminent scientists 
would never return from outer space! But Erg 
Noor would make no mistake. 

Nisa Creet was suddenly overcome by a 
feeling of nausea which meant that the space-
ship had deviated from its course by a tiny 
fraction of a degree, something possible only 
at the reduced speed at which they were 
travelling: at full speed not one of the ship's 
fragile 
human 
load would have remained 

alive. The grey mist before the girl's eyes 
had not had time to disperse before the 
nausea swept over her again as the ship re-
turned to its course. Supersensitive feelers had 
located a meteoroid, the greatest enemy of 
the spaceships, in the black emptiness ahead 
of them and had automatically made the de-
viation. 
The 
electronic computers 
guiding 
the ship (only they could carry out all mani-
pulations with the necessary rapidity, since 
human nerves are unsuited to Cosmic speeds) 
had taken her off her course in a millionth 
of a second and, the danger past, had re-
turned her with equal speed. 

"What could have prevented computers 
like these from saving A/grab?" 
wondered 
Nisa when she had recovered. That ship had 
most certainly been damaged by a meteoroid. 
Erg Noor had told her that up to then one 
spaceship in ten had been wrecked by meteo-
roids, despite the invention of such delicate 
locators as Voll Hoad's and the power screens 
that repelled smaller particles. After every-
thing had been so well planned and provided 
for, the loss of Atgrab had placed them in a 
dangerous position. Mentally Nisa went over 
everything that had happened since they had 
taken off. 

Cosmic Expedition No. 37 had been sent 
to the planetary system of the nearest star 
in the Ophiuchus Constellation whose only 
inhabited planet, Zirda, had long been in com-
munication 
with 
Earth and other 
worlds 
through the Great Circle. Suddenly the planet 
had gone silent, and for over seventy years 

1 
;,iOf, 

nothing more had been 
heard 
from 
there. 
It was the duty of Earth, as the nearest of 
the Circle planets to Zirda, to find out what 
had happened. With this aim in view the expe-
dition's ship had taken on board a large num-
ber of instruments and several prominent 
scientists, those whose nerves, after lengthy 
testing, had proved capable of standing up 
to confinement in a spaceship for several 
years. The ship was fuelled with anameson; 
only the barely necessary amount had been 
taken, not because of its weight but because 
of the tremendous size of the containers 
in which it was stored. It was expected that 
supplies could be renewed on Zirda. In case 
something serious had happened to Zirda, 
Second Class Spaceship Algrab was to have 
met Tantra with fuel supplies on the orbit 
of planet K2-2N-88. 

Nisa's attuned ear caught the changed tone 
in the hum of the artificial gravitational field. 
The discs of three instruments on the right 
began to wink irregularly as the starboard 
electronic feeler came into action. An angular 
mass flashed on to the screen, brightening 
it up. It flew straight at Tantra like a shell 
which meant that it was a long way away—a 
huge fragment of matter such as is seldom 
met with in Cosmic space, and Nisa hurried 
to determine its volume, mass, velocity and 
direction. She did not return to her medi-
tations until the spool of the automatic log 
gave a click to show that the entries were 
finished. 

Her most vivid memory was that of a blood-

red sun that had been steadily growing in 
their field of vision during the last months 
of their fourth space-borne year. It had been 
the fourth year for the inhabitants of the 
spaceship as it travelled with a speed of 5/6ths 
of the absolute unit, the speed of light, but 
on Earth seven independent years had passed. 

The filters on the screens were kind to 
human eyes; they reduced the composition 
of the rays of any celestial body to what 
they would have been had they been seen 
through the thick terrestrial atmosphere with 
its protective screens of ozone and water 
vapours. 
The 
indescribable 
ghostly 
violet 
light 
of 
the high-temperature bodies was 
toned down to blue or white and the gloomy 
greyish-pink stars took on jolly golden-yellow 
hues, like our Sun. A celestial body that 
burned triumphantly 
with 
bright crimson 
fire took on a deep, blood-red colour, the 
tone that a terrestrial observer sees in stars 
of the spectral class M 5 . 7 The planet was 
much nearer to its star than Earth is to the 
Sun and as the ship drew nearer to Zirda 
the star grew into a tremendous crimson 
disc that irradiated a mass of heat rays. 

For two months before approaching Zirda 
Tantra had begun attempts to get in touch 
with the planet's outer space station. There 
was only one such station—on a small natural 
satellite with no atmosphere, that was much 
nearer to Zirda than the Moon is to Earth. 

The spaceship continued calling when the 
planet was no more than thirty million kilo-
metres away and the terrific speed of Tantra 

had been reduced to three thousand kilo-
metres a second. It was Nisa's watch but 
all the crew were awake, sitting in anticipa-
tion in front of the control-tower screens. 

Nisa kept on calling, increasing the power 
of the transmission and sending rays out 
fanwise ahead of the ship. 

At last they saw the tiny shining dot of 
the satellite. The spaceship came into orbit 
around the planet, approaching it in a spiral 
and gradually adjusting its speed to that of 
the satellite. Soon Tantra's speed was the 
same as that of the fast-moving little satellite 
and it seemed as though an invisible hawser 
held them fast. The ship's electronic stereo-
telescopes searched the surface of the satel-
lite until the crew of Tantra were suddenly 
confronted 
with 
an 
unforgettable 
sight. 

A huge, flat-topped glass building seemed 
to be on fire in the rays of the blood-red sun. 
Directly under the roof was something in 
the nature of an assembly hall. There a num-
ber of beings—unlike terrestrial humans but 
unmistakably people—were frozen into immo-
bility. Excitedly, Pour Hyss, the astronomer 
of the expedition, continued to adjust the 
focus. The vague rows of people visible under 
the glass roof were absolutely motionless. 
Pour Hyss increased the instrument's magni-
fication. Out of the vagueness a dais surround-
ed by instrument panels appeared, and on 
it a long table on which a man sat cross-
legged facing the audience, his crazy, terri-
fying eyes staring into the distance. 

"They're dead, frozen!" exclaimed Erg Noor. 

The spaceship continued to hover over 
Zirda's satellite and fourteen pairs of eyes 
remained fixed on that glass tomb, for such, 
indeed, it was. How long had the dead been 
sitting there in their glass house? The planet 
had broken off communication seventy years 
before and if we add to that six years for 
the rays to reach Earth it meant three quar-
ters of a century. 

All eyes were turned on the commander. 
Erg Noor, his face pale, was staring into the 
yellow, smoky 
atmosphere 
of the planet 
through which the lines of the mountain 
ranges and the glint of the sea were faintly 
discernible. But there was nothing to provide 
the answer they had come there for. 

"The station perished seventy-five years 
ago and has not been re-established! That 
can only mean a catastrophe on the planet. 
We must 
go down into the atmosphere, 
perhaps even land. Everybody is here, that's 
why I'm asking your opinion." 

The only objection was raised by Pour 
Hyss, a man on his first Cosmic trip; he had 
been substituted for an experienced worker 
who had fallen ill just before the start. Nisa 
iooked with indignation at his big, hawk-
like nose and his ugly ears set low down on 
his head. 

"If there has been a catastrophe on the 
planet there is no possibility of our getting 
anameson there. If we circle the planet at 
low level we shall reduce our supply 
of 
planetary fuel and if we land we shall reduce 
it still more. Apart from that we don't know 

what's happened, there may be some power-
ful radiations that will kill us." 

The other 
members 
of 
the expedition 
supported their commander. 

"There is no planetary radiation that can 
be dangerous to a ship with Cosmic shielding. 
Weren't we sent here to find out what has 
happened? What are we going to tell the 
Great Circle? It isn't enough to establish a 
fact, we have to explain it—excuse me if this 
sounds like a lecture to schoolboys!" said 
Erg Noor and the usual metallic tones in his 
voice now had a note of ridicule in them. 
"I don't imagine we can evade doing what 
is our plain duty." 

"The upper layers of the atmosphere have a 
normal temperature!" exclaimed Nisa, happi-
ly, on completion of her rapidly performed 
measurements. 

Erg Noor smiled and began to put the ship 
down in a spiral each turn of which was 
slower than the last as they neared the sur-
face of the planet. Zirda was somewhat small-
er than Earth and no great speed was needed 
to circumnavigate it at low level. The astro-
nomers and the geologist checked the maps 
of the planet with what was observed by 
Tantra's optical instruments. There had been 
no noticeable change in the outlines of the 
continents and the seas gleamed calmly in 
the red sun. Nor had the chains of moun-
tains changed from the shapes that were 
known from former photographs—but 
the 
planet was silent. 

The crew spent thirty-five hours at their 

instruments, relieving each other occasionally. 

The composition of the atmosphere, the 
radiation of the red sun, everything agreed 
with 
formerly 
recorded 
Zirda 
data. 
Erg 
Noor looked for the Zirda stratosphere tables 
in his reference book. Ionization was higher 
than they showed. A vague and alarming 
concept was taking form in Noor's mind. 

On the sixth turn of the descending spiral 
the outlines of big cities became clearly visible. 
And still not a sound was recorded by the 
spaceship's receivers. 

Nisa Creet was relieved from her post for 
a meal and seemed to have dozed off for a 
while. She thought, however, that she had 
not slept for more than a few minutes. The 
spaceship was crossing Zirda's night disc at a 
speed no greater than that of a terrestrial 
helicopter. Below them there should have 
been cities, factories and ports, but not a 
single light showed in the pitch blackness no 
matter how thoroughly the powerful stereo-
telescopes searched the ground. The thunder 
of 
the spaceship cutting through the at-
mosphere should have been audible for doz-
ens of miles. Another hour passed and still 
no light was seen. The anxious waiting was 
becoming unbearable. Noor switched on the 
warning sirens hoping that their awe-inspir-
ing howl, added to the roar of the spaceship, 
would be heard by the mysteriously silent 
inhabitants of Zirda. 

A wave of fiery light swept away the evil 
darkness as Tantra reached the daylight side 
of the planet. Below them everything was 

still black. Rapidly developed and enlarged 
photographs showed that the earth was cov-
ered with a solid carpet of flowers something 
like the velvety-black poppies that grow on 
Earth. The masses of black poppies stretched 
for thousands of miles to the exclusion of 
all other vegetation—trees and bushes, reeds 
and grass. The streets of the cities looked 
like the ribs of giant skeletons lying on a 
black carpet; metal structures formed gaping 
rusty wounds. 
Not a living being, not a 
tree anywhere, nothing but the black poppies! 

Tantra 
dropped 
an 
observation 
bomb 
station and again plunged into the night. 
Six hours later the robot reported the make-
up of the air, temperature, pressure and other 
conditions obtaining on the surface of the 
planet. 
Everything was normal 
for 
Zirda 
with the exception of increased radioactivity. 

"What an awful tragedy!" muttered Eon 
Thai, the expedition's biologist, in a dull voice 
as he recorded the data supplied by the sta-
tion. "They have killed themselves and every-
thing on their planet!" 

"How could they?" asked Nisa, hiding 
the tears that were ready to flow. "Is it as 
bad as that? The ionization isn't so very 
high." 

" A 
long time 
has passed since then," 
answered the biologist glumly. 
His manly 
Circassian face with its aquiline nose assumed 
an expression of sternness, despite his youth. 
"Radioactive disintegration is dangerous just 
because it accumulates unnoticed. For hund-
reds of years the total radiation could increase 

corns by corus 
(a unit of radiation); then 
suddenly there comes a qualitative change, 
heredity collapses, the reproduction of the 
species ceases and added to that there are 
epidemics 
of 
radiation 
diseases. This has 
happened more than once before, the Circle 
knows of similar catastrophes." 

"Such as the so-called 'planet of the lilac 
sun'," came Erg Noor's voice from behind 
them. 

"Whose sun of spectral class A°, with a 
light intensity equal to 78 of our suns, pro-
vided its inhabitants with very high energy," 
added the morose Pour Hyss. 

"Where is that planet?" asked Eon Thai, 
the biologist. "Isn't that the one the Council 
intends to colonize?" 

"That's the one, the lost A/grab was named 
after its star." 

"The 
star 
Algrab, that's 
Delta 
Corvi!" 
exclaimed the biologist. "But it's such a long 
way off!" 

"Forty-six parsecs. But we're constantly 
increasing the power of our spaceships..." 

The biologist nodded his head and mut-
tered that it was hardly right to call a space-
ship after a star that had perished. 

"The star didn't perish and the planet is 
still safe and sound. Before another century 
has passed we shall plant vegetation there 
and settle the planet," said Erg Noor with 
confidence. 

He had decided to perform a difficult 
manoeuvre—to change the ship's orbit from 
latitudinal to meridional, sending the ship 

along 
a north-south 
line 
parallel 
to 
the 
planet's axis of rotation. How could they 
leave the planet until they were sure that 
there were no survivors? It might be that 
survivors were unable to communicate with 
the spaceship because power installations had 
been 
wrecked 
and 
instruments 
damaged. 

This was not the first time Nisa had seen 
her commander at the control desk in a mo-
ment of great responsibility. With his impene-
trably 
expressionless face and his abrupt 
but always precise movements he seemed like 
a hero of legendary times to Nisa. 

Again Tantra continued her hopeless jour-
ney round Zirda, this time from pole to pole. 
In some places, especially in the temperate 
latitudes, there were wide belts of bare earth; 
a yellow haze hung over them and through 
it, from time to time, appeared the lines of 
gigantic red dunes from which the wind sent 
up clouds of sand. 

Then again came the funeral pall of black 
velvet 
poppies, the only 
plant that 
had 
withstood radioactivity or had produced a 
mutation of its species viable under irradia-
tion. 

The whole picture was clear. It was not 
only useless, it was even dangerous to search 
for supplies of anameson that had, on the 
recommendation of the Great Circle, been 
laid in for visitors from other worlds (Zir-
da had no spaceships of her own, only planet-
ships). Tantra 
began slowly unwinding the 
spiral away from the planet. She gained a 
velocity of 17 kilometres a second using her 

ion trigger motors, the planetary motors that 
gave her speed enough for trips between 
adjacent planets and for taking off and land-
ing, and drew away from the dead planet. 
Tantra turned her nose towards an uninhab-
ited system known only by its code name, 
where bomb beacons had been thrown out 
and where Algrab should have awaited her. 
The anameson motors were switched on and 
in fifty-two hours they accelerated the space-
ship to her normal speed of 900,000,000 
kilometres an hour. Fifteen months' journey 
would take them to the meeting place (eleven 
months of the dependent time of the ship). 
The whole crew, with the exception of those 
on watch, could spend that time in deep 
sleep. A month, however, passed in discussion, 
in calculations and in the preparation of a 
report for the Council. From reference books 
it 
was discovered that 
risky 
experiments 
had been made on Zirda with partially disin-
tegrating atomic fuels. They found references 
to 
statements 
by 
leading 
scientists 
who 
warned the people that there were symptoms 
of the adverse biological effect of the experi-
ments and demanded that they be stopped. 
A hundred and eighteen years before a brief 
warning had been sent through the Great 
Circle; it should have been sufficient for 
people of the higher intellectual categories 
but 
apparently 
it 
had not 
been 
treated 
seriously by the government of Zirda. 

There could be no doubt that Zirda had 
perished from an accumulation of harmful 
radioactive material following numerous care-

less experiments and the reckless use of 
dangerous forms of nuclear energy instead 
of wisely continuing the search for other, 
less harmful sources. 

The mystery had long since been solved, 
twice the spaceship's crew had changed their 
three months' 
period of sleep for normal 
periods of activity of the same length. 

Tantra 
had been circling round the grey 
planet for many days and with each passing 
hour the possibility of meeting Algrab 
grew 
less and 
less. Something terrible 
loomed 
ahead. 

Erg Noor stood in the doorway with his 
eyes on Nisa as she sat there in meditation— 
her inclined head with its cap of thick hair 
like a luxuriant golden flower, the mischie-
vous, boyish 
profile, the slightly 
slanting 
eyes that were often screwed up by restrained 
laughter and were now wide open, appre-
hensively but courageously probing the un-
known... The girl did not realize what a trem-
endous 
moral 
support 
her 
selfless 
love 
had become for him. Despite the long years 
of trial that had steeled his will-power and his 
senses, he sometimes grew tired of being 
commander, of having to be ready at any 
moment to shoulder any responsibility for the 
crew, for the ship and for the success of the 
expedition. Back there on Earth such single-
handed responsibility 
had long since been 
abandoned—decisions there were taken collec-
tively by the group of people who had to car-
ry them out. If anything unusual occurred 
on Earth you could always get advice, and 

consultations on the most intricate problems 
could be arranged. Here there was nobody 
to turn to and spaceship commanders were 
granted special rights. It would have been 
easier if such responsibility had been for two 
or three years instead of the ten to fifteen 
years that were normal for space expeditions! 
Erg Noor entered the control tower. 

Nisa jumped up to meet him. 
"I've got all the necessary material and the 
charts," he said, "we'll start the computer 
working!" 

The commander stretched himself in his 
armchair and slowly turned over the thin 
metal sheets he had brought, calling out the 
numbers of coordinates, the strength of mag-
netic, electric and gravitational fields, the 
power of Cosmic dust streams and the velo-
city and density of meteoroid streams. Nisa, 
all 
her 
muscles 
tensed with 
excitement, 
pressed the buttons and turned the knobs of 
the computer. Erg Noor listened to a series of 
answers, 
frowned 
and 
lapsed 
into 
deep 
thought. 

"There's a strong gravitational field in our 
way, the area in the Scorpion where there is 
an accumulation of dark matter near star 
6555CR + 11PKU," began Noor. "We can 
save fuel by deviating this way, towards the 
Serpent. In the old days they flew without 
motors, 
using 
the 
gravitational 
fields as 
accelerators, along their edges." 

"Can we do the same?" asked Nisa. 
"No, our spaceships are too fast. At a speed 
of 5/6ths of the absolute unit or 250,000 

kilometres a second our weight would be 
12,000 times greater in a field of gravitation 
and that would turn the whole expedition 
into dust. We can only fly like this in the 
Cosmos, far 
from large accumulations 
of 
matter. As soon as the spaceship enters a 
gravitational field we have to reduce speed, 
the stronger the field the more we must re-
duce." 

"So there's a contradiction here," said 
Nisa, resting her head on her hand in a child-
ish manner, "the stronger the gravitational 
field the slower we have to fly!" 

"That's only true where velocities close 
to the speed of light are concerned, when 
the spaceship is something like a ray of light 
and can only move in a straight line or along 
the so-called curve of equal tension." 

"If I've understood you correctly we have 
to aim our Tantra light ray straight at the 
solar system." 

"That's where the great difficulty of space 
travel comes in. It's practically impossible 
to aim directly at any star although we make 
all the corrective 
calculations 
imaginable. 
Throughout the entire journey we have to 
compute the accumulating error and constant-
ly change the course of the ship so that no 
automatic piloting is possible. Our position 
now is a dangerous one. We have nothing 
left to start another acceleration going so 
that a halt or even a considerable reduction 
in speed after this acceleration would be 
certain death. Look, the danger is here—in 
area 344 +2U that has never been explored. 

Here there are no stars, no inhabited planets, 
nothing is known except the gravitational 
field—there is its edge. We'll wait for the 
astronomers before we make the final deci-
sion—after the fifth circle we'll wake up 
everybody but in the meantime..." The com-
mander 
rubbed 
his temples and yawned. 

"The effect of the sporamin is wearing 
off," exclaimed Nisa, "you can go to sleep!" 

"Good, I'll be all right here, in this chair. 
Suppose a miracle happens ... just one sound 
from them!" 

There was something in Erg Noor's voice 
that sent Nisa's heart palpitating with her 
love for him. She wanted to take that stub-
born head of his, press it to her breast and 
stroke the dark hair with its prematurely 
grey threads. 

Nisa got up, placed the reference sheets 
carefully together and turned out the light, 
leaving only a dull green glow that illuminat-
ed the instrument panels and the clocks. 
The spaceship was travelling fairly quietly 
in a complete vacuum as it described its 
gigantic curve. The auburn-haired navigator 
silently took her place at the "brain" of 
the giant ship. The instruments, tuned to a 
particular note, hummed softly; the slightest 
disorder made them sing false. Today, how-
ever, the quiet humming kept on the right 
note. On rare occasions she heard soft blows, 
like the sounds of a gong—that was the auxi-
liary planetary motor switching on to keep 
the ship truly on her curve. The powerful 
anameson motors were silent. The peace of a 

long night hung over the sleepy ship as though 
no serious danger threatened her and her 
inhabitants. At any moment the long-awaited 
call signal would be heard in the loudspeaker 
and the two ships would begin to check their 
unbelievably rapid flight, would draw closer 
on parallel courses and would at last so equal-
ize their speeds that they would be as good 
as lying still beside each other. A wide tubular 
gallery would connect the two ships and 
Tantra would regain her tremendous strength. 

Deep down in her heart Nisa was calm, she 
had faith in her commander. Five years of 
travel had not seemed either long or tiring. 
Especially since Nisa had begun to love... 
But even before that the absorbingly interest-
ing observations, the electronic 
recordings 
of books, music and films gave her every 
opportunity to increase her fund of knowl-
edge and not feel the loss of her beautiful 
Earth, that tiny speck of dust lost in the 
depths of the infinity of darkness. Her fellow-
travellers were people of great erudition and 
then, when her nerves were exhausted by a 
surfeit of impressions or lengthy, strenuous 
work, there was continued sleep. Sleep was 
maintained by attuning the patient to hypno-
tic oscillations and, after certain preliminary 
medical treatment, big stretches of time were 
lost in forgetfulness and passed without leav-
ing a trace. Nisa was happy because she was 
near the man she loved. The only thing that 
troubled her was the thought that others 
were having 
a harder time, especially Erg 
Noor. If only she could ... no, what could a 

young and still very green astronavigator 
do, compared with such a man! 
Perhaps 
her tenderness, her constant fund of good-
will, her ardent desire to give up everything 
in order to make easier that tremendous 
labour would help. 

The commander of the expedition woke 
up and 
raised his sleep-heavy head. The 
instruments were humming evenly as before, 
there were still the occasional thuds of the 
planetary motors. Nisa Creet was at the in-
struments, bending slightly over them, the 
shadows of fatigue on her young face. Erg 
Noor cast a glance at the clock showing space-
ship-time 
and in a single athletic 
bound 
leaped out of the deep chair. 

"I've been asleep fourteen hours! And you 
didn't wake me, Nisa! That's..." Meeting her 
radiant glance he cut himself short. "Off 
to bed at once!" 

"May I sleep here, like you did?" asked the 
girl. She took a hurried meal, washed herself 
and dropped into the deep armchair. Her 
flashing hazel eyes, framed in dark rings, 
were stealthily following Erg Noor as he took 
his place at the instrument panels after a 
refreshing wave bath and a good meal. He 
checked up the indicators on the electronics 
communications protector and then began to 
walk up and down with rapid strides. 

"Why aren't you sleeping?" he asked the 
navigator severely. 

She shook her red curls that were by then 
in need of clipping—women on extra-terres-
trial 
expeditions did not wear long hair. 

" I was thinking..." she began hesitantly, 
"and now, when we are faced with great 
danger 
I bow my head before the might 
and majesty of man who has penetrated to 
the stars, far, far into the depths of space! 
Much of this is customary for you, but I'm 
in the Cosmos for the first time. Just think 
of it, I'm taking part in a magnificent journey 
through the stars to new worlds!" 

Erg Noor smiled wanly and rubbed his 
forehead. 

"I shall have to disappoint you, or rather, 
I must show you the real measure of our 
might. Look..." He stopped beside a projec-
tor and on the back wall of the control tower 
the glittering spiral of the Galaxy appeared. 
Erg Noor pointed to a ragged outer branch 
of the spiral composed of sparse stars look-
ing like dull dust and scarcely perceptible in 
the surrounding darkness. 

"This is a desert area in the Galaxy, an 
outer fringe poor in light and life, and it is 
there that our solar system is situated and 
where we are at present. That branch of the 
Galaxy stretches, as you can see, from Cygnus 
to 
Carina and, in addition to being far 
removed from the central zone, it contains 
a dark cloud, here... Just to travel along 
that one branch of the Galaxy would take 
our Tantra 
40,000 independent years. To 
cross the empty space that separates our 
branch 
from 
our 
neighbours 
would 
take 
4,000 years. So you see that our flights into 
the depths of space are still nothing more 
than just marking time on our own ground, 

a ground with a diameter of no more than 
fifty light years! How little we should know 
of the Universe if it were not for the might 
of the Great Circle. Reports, images and ideas 
transmitted through space that is unconquer-
able in man's brief span of life reach us 
sooner or later, and we get to know still 
more distant worlds. Knowledge is constantly 
piling up and the work goes on all the time!" 

Nisa listened in silence. 
"The first interstellar flights..." continued 
Erg Noor, still lost in thought. "Little ships 
of low speed with no powerful protective 
installations ... and people in those days 
lived only half as long as we do—that was 
the period of man's real greatness!" 

Nisa jerked up her head as she usually 
did when she disagreed. 

"And when new ways of overcoming space 
have been discovered and people don't just 
force their way through it like we do, they'll 
say the same about you—those were the he-
roes who conquered space with their primi-
tive methods!" 

The commander smiled happily and held 
out his hand to the girl. 

"They'll say it about you, too, Nisa!" 
"I'm proud to be here with you!" she 
answered blushing. "And 
I'm prepared to 
give up everything if I can only travel into 
the cosmos again and again!" 

"I know that," said Erg Noor, thought-
fully, "but that's not the way everybody 
thinks!" 

Feminine intuition gave her an insight into 

the thoughts of her commander. In his cabin 
there were two stereoportraits, 
splendidly 
done in violet-gold tones. Both were of her, 
Veda Kong, a woman of great beauty, a 
specialist in ancient history, whose transpa-
rent sky-blue eyes looked out from under her 
long eyebrows. Tanned by the sun, smiling 
radiantly, she had raised her hands to her 
ash-blonde hair. In the other picture she was 
seated, laughing heartily, on a ship's bronze 
gun, a relic of ancient days. 

Erg Noor lost some of his impetuosity-
he sat down slowly in front of the astronavi-
gator. 

"If 
you only knew, Nisa, how brutally 
fate dealt with my dreams, there on Zirda!" 
he said suddenly, in a dull voice, placing 
his fingers cautiously on the lever controlling 
the anameson motors as though he intended 
accelerating the spaceship to the limit. 

"If Zirda had not perished and we had 
got our supplies of fuel," he continued, in 
reply to her mute question, " I would have 
led the expedition farther. That is what I 
had arranged with the Council. Zirda would 
have made the necessary report to Earth and 
Tantra 
would have continued her journey 
with those who wanted to go. The others 
would have waited for A/grab, it could have 
gone on to Zirda after a tour of duty here." 

"Who would have wanted to stay on Zir-
da?" exclaimed the girl, indignantly. "Unless 
Pour Hyss would. He's a great scientist though, 
wouldn't he be interested in gaining further 
knowledge?" 

"And you, Nisa?" 
"I'd go, of course." 
"Where to?" asked Erg Noor suddenly, 
fixing his eyes on the girl. 

"Anywhere you like, even..." and she point-
ed to a patch of abysmal blackness between 
two arms of the starry spiral of the Galaxy; 
she returned Noor's fixed stare with one 
equally determined, her lips slightly parted. 

"Oh, no, not as far as that! You know, 
Nisa, my dear little astronavigator, about 
eighty-five years ago, Cosmic Expedition No. 
34, the so-called 'Three-Stage 
Expedition' 
left Earth. It consisted of three spaceships 
carrying fuel for each other and left Earth 
for the Lyra Constellation. The two ships 
that were not carrying scientists passed their 
anameson on to the third and then came back 
to Earth. That is the way mountain-climbers 
reached the tops of the highest peaks. Then 
the third ship, Parus..." 

"That's 
the ship that never 
returned!" 
whispered Nisa excitedly. 

"That's 
right, 
Parus 
didn't 
return. 
It 
reached its objective and was lost on the 
return journey after sending a message. The 
goal was the big planetary system of Vega, or 
Alpha Lyrae, a bright blue star that countless 
generations of human eyes have admired in 
the northern sky. The distance to Vega is 
eight parsecs and people had never been so 
far away 
from 
our 
Sun. Anyway, Parus 
got there. We do not know the cause of its 
loss, whether it was a meteoroid or an irrepar-
able breakdown. It is even possible that the 

ship is still moving through space and the 
heroes whom we regard as dead are still alive." 

"That would be terrible!" 
"Such is the fate of any spaceship that 
cannot maintain a speed close to that of light. 
It is immediately separated from the home 
planet by thousands of years." 

"What message did Parus send?" asked the 
girl. 

"There wasn't much of it. It was inter-
rupted several times and then broke 
off 
altogether. 
I remember every word of it: 
'I am Parus. I am Parus, travelling twenty-six 
years from Vega ... enough ... shall wait... Ve-
ga's four planets ... nothing more beautiful ... 
what happiness...' " 

"But they were calling for help, they want-
ed to wait somewhere!" 

"Of 
course they were calling for help, 
otherwise the spaceship wouldn't have used 
up the tremendous energy needed for the 
transmission. But nothing could be done, not 
another 
word 
was received from 
Parus." 

"They were twenty-six independent years 
on their way back and the journey from Vega 
to the Sun is thirty-one years. They must have 
been somewhere near us, or even nearer to 
Earth." 

"Hardly, unless, of course, they exceeded 
the normal speed and got close to the quan-
tum limit.8 That would have been very dan-
gerous!" 

Briefly Erg Noor explained the mathema-
tical basis for the destructive change that 
takes place in matter when it approaches the 

speed of light, but he noticed that the girl 
was not paying any great attention to him. 

" I understand all that!" she exclaimed the 
moment the commander had finished his 
explanation. " I would have realized it at 
once 
if 
your 
story 
of 
the 
loss of 
the 
spaceship hadn't taken my mind off it. Such 
losses are always terrible and one cannot 
become reconciled to them!" 

"Now you realize the chief thing in the 
communication," said Erg Noor 
gloomily. 
"They discovered some particularly beauti-
ful worlds. I have long been dreaming of 
following the route taken by Parus; with mod-
ern improvements we can do it with one 
ship now. I've been living with a dream of 
Vega, the blue sun with the beautiful planets, 
ever since early youth." 

"To see such worlds..." breathed Nisa with 
a breaking voice. "But to see them and re-
turn would take sixty terrestrial or forty 
dependent years ... and that's ... half a life-
time." 

"Great achievements demand great sacri-
fices. For me, though, it would not be a sac-
rifice. My life on Earth has only been a few 
short 
intervals 
between journeys 
through 
space. I was born on a spaceship, you know!" 

"How could that have happened?" asked 
the girl in amazement. 

"Cosmic Expedition No. 35 consisted of 
four ships. My mother was astronomer on 
one of them. I was born half-way to the 
binary star MN19026 + 7AL and managed 
to contravene the law twice over. Twice— 

firstly by being born on a spaceship and 
secondly because I grew up and was educated 
by my parents and not in a children's school. 
What else could they have done? When the 
expedition returned to Earth I was eighteen 
years old. I had learnt the art of piloting a 
spaceship and had acted as astronavigator 
in place of one who was taken ill. I could 
also work as a mechanic at the planetary or 
the 
anameson 
motors 
and 
all 
this 
was 
accepted as the Labours of Hercules I had 
to perform on reaching maturity." 

"Still 
I don't understand..." began Nisa. 

"About 
my mother? You'll 
understand 
when you get a bit older! 
Although the 
doctors didn't know it then, the Anti-T serum 
wouldn't keep... Well, never mind what the 
reason was—I was brought to a control tower 
like this one to look at the screens with my 
uncomprehending baby eyes and watch the 
stars dancing up and down on them. We were 
flying towards the Lupus Constellation where 
there was a binary star close to the Sun. The 
two dwarfs, one blue and the other orange 
were hidden by a dark cloud. The first thing 
that impinged on my infant consciousness 
was the sky over a lifeless planet that I ob-
served from under the glass dome of a tempo-
rary station. The planets of double stars are 
usually lifeless on account of the irregularity 
of their orbits. The expedition made a landing 
and for seven months engaged in mineral 
prospecting. As far as I remember there were 
enormous quantities of platinum, 
osmium 
and iridium there. My first toys were unbelie-

vably heavy building blocks made of iridium. 
And that sky, my first sky, was black and 
dotted with the pure lights of unwinking 
stars, and there were two suns of indescri-
bable beauty, one a deep blue and the other 
a bright orange. I remember how their rays 
sometimes crossed and at those times our 
planet was inundated with so much jolly 
green light that I shouted and sang for joy!" 
Erg Noor stopped. "That's enough, I got 
carried away by my reminiscences and you 
have to sleep." 

"Go on, please do, I've never heard any-
thing so interesting," Nisa begged him, but 
the commander was implacable. He brought 
a pulsating hypnotizer and, either because 
of his impelling eyes or the sleep-producing 
apparatus, the girl was soon fast asleep and 
did not wake up until the day before they 
were to enter the sixth circle. By the cold 
look on the commander's face Nisa Creet 
realized that Algrab 
had not shown 
up. 

"You woke up just at the right time!" 
he said as soon as Nisa had taken her electric 
and wave baths and returned ready for work. 
"Switch on the animation music and light. 
For everybody!" 

Swiftly Nisa pressed a row of buttons send-
ing intermittent bursts of light accompanied 
by a specific music of low, vibrant chords 
that gradually increased in intensity, to all 
the cabins where members of the Cosmic 
expedition were sleeping. This initiated the 
gradual awakening of the inhibited nervous 
system to bring it back to its normal active 

state. Five hours later all the members of the 
expedition gathered in the control tower; 
they had by then fully recovered from their 
sleep and had taken food and nerve stimulants. 

News of the loss of the auxiliary spaceship 
was received in different ways by different 
people. As Erg Noor expected, the expedition 
was equal to the occasion. Not a word of 
despair, not a glance of fear. Pour Hyss, 
who 
had not shown 
himself 
particularly 
brave on Zirda, heard the news without a 
tremor. Louma Lasvy, the expedition's young 
physician, went slightly 
pale and secretly 
licked her dry lips. 

"To the memory of our lost comrades!" 
said the commander as he switched on the 
screen of a projector showing Algrab, a pho-
tograph that had been taken before Tantra 
took off. All rose to their feet. On the screen 
one after another came the photographs of 
the seven members of Algrab's 
crew, some 
serious, 
some 
smiling. 
Erg 
Noor 
named 
each of them in turn and the travellers gave 
him the farewell salute. Such was the cus-
tom of the astronauts. Spaceships that set off 
together 
always 
carried 
photographs 
of 
all the people of the expedition. When a ship 
disappeared it might keep travelling in Cosmic 
space for a long time with its crew still alive. 
But this made no difference, the ship would 
never return. There was no real possibility 
of searching for the ship and rendering it 
aid. Minor faults never, or seldom, occurred 
and were easily repaired, but a serious break-
down in the machinery had never been success-

fully 
repaired in the Cosmos. Sometimes 
ships, like Parus, managed to send a last mes-
sage, but in the majority of cases such mes-
sages did 
not 
reach their destination on 
account of the great difficulty of directing 
them. The Great Circle had, for thousands of 
years, been investigating exact routes for its 
transmissions and could vary them by directing 
them from planet to planet. The spaceships 
were usually in unexplored areas where the 
direction for a message could only be guessed. 

There was a conviction amongst astronauts 
that there existed in the Cosmos certain 
neutral fields or zero areas in which all ra-
diation and all communications sank 
like 
stones 
in water. Astrophysicists, 
however, 
regarded the zero areas to be nothing more 
than the idle invention of Cosmic travellers 
who were, in general, inclined to monstrous 
fantasies. 

After that sad ceremony and a very short 
conference, Erg Noor turned Tantra in the 
direction of Earth and switched on the ana-
meson motors. Forty-eight hours later they 
were switched off again and the spaceship 
began to approach its own planet at the rate 
of 21,000 million kilometres in every twenty-
four hours. The journey back to the Sun 
would take about six terrestrial, or independ-
ent, years. Everybody was busy in the con-
trol tower and in the ship's combined library 
and laboratory where a new course was being 
computed and plotted on the charts. 

The task was to fly the whole six years 
and use anameson only for purposes of cor-

recting the ship's course. In other words the 
spaceship had to be flown with as little loss 
of acceleration as possible. Everybody was 
worried about the unexplored area 344 + 2U 
that lay between the Sun and Tantra. There 
was no way of avoiding it: on both sides of 
it, as far as the Sun, lay belts of free meteo-
roids and, apart from that, they would lose 
velocity in turning the ship. 

Two months later the computation of the 
line of flight had been completed. 
Tantra 
began to describe a long, flat curve. 

The wonderful ship was in excellent con-
dition and her speed was kept within the com-
puted limits. Now nothing but time, about 
four 
dependent 
years, separated the ship 
from its home. 

Erg Noor and Nisa Creet finished their 
watch and, dead tired, started their period 
of long sleep. Together with them two astro-
nomers, the geologist, biologist, 
physician 
and four engineers departed into-temporary 
forgetfulness. 

The watch was taken over by an experi-
enced astronavigator, Pel Lynn, who was on 
his second expedition, assisted by astronomer 
Ingrid Dietra and electronic engineer Kay 
Bear who had volunteered to join 
them. 
Ingrid, with Pel Lynn's consent, often went 
away to the library adjoining the control 
tower. She and her old friend, Kay Bear, 
were 
writing 
a 
monumental 
symphony, 
Death of a Planet, inspired by the tragedy 
of Zirda. Pel Lynn, whenever he grew tired 
of the hum of the instruments and his con-

templation of the black void of the cosmos, 
left Ingrid at the control desk and plunged 
into the thrilling task of deciphering puzzling 
inscriptions brought from a planet in the sys-
tem of the nearest stars of the Centaur whose 
inhabitants 
had mysteriously 
quit 
it. 
He 
believed in the success of his impossible un-
dertaking. 

Twice again watches were changed, the 
spaceship had drawn ten billion kilometres 
nearer Earth and still the anameson motors 
had only been run for a few hours. 

One of Pel Lynn's watches, the fourth 
since Tantra 
had left the place where she 
was to have met A/grab, was coming to an 
end. 

Ingrid Dietra, the astronomer, had finished 
a calculation and turned to Pel Lynn who was 
watching, with melancholy mien, the constant 
flickering of the red arrows on the graded 
blue scales of the gravitation-meters. 
The 
usual sluggishness of psychic reactions that 
not even the strongest people could avoid 
made itself felt during the second half of the 
watch. For months and years the spaceship 
had 
been 
automatically 
piloted 
along 
a 
given course. If anything untoward had hap-
pened, something that the electronic machines 
were incapable of dealing with, it would have 
meant the loss of the ship, for human inter-
vention could not have saved it since the hu-
man brain, no matter how well trained it 
may be, cannot react with the necessary 
alacrity. 

"In my opinion we are already deep in the 

unknown area 344 + 2U. The commander 
wanted to take over the watch himself when 
we reached it," said Ingrid to the astronavi-
gator. Pel Lynn glanced up at the counter 
that marked off the days. 

"Another two days and we change watches. 
So far there doesn't seem to be anything to 
worry about. Shall we see the watch through?" 

Ingrid nodded assent. Kay Bear came into 
the control tower from the stern of the ship 
and took his usual seat beside the gyroscopic-
stabilizing mechanism. Pel Lynn yawned and 
stood up. 

"I'll get some sleep for a couple of hours," 
he said to Ingrid. She got up obediently and 
went forward to the control desk. 

Tantra was travelling smoothly in an ab-
solute vacuum. Not a single meteoroid, not 
even at a great distance, had been registered 
by the supersensitive Voll Hoad detectors. 
The spaceship's course now lay somewhat 
to one side of the Sun, about one and a half 
flight 
years. The screens of the forward 
observation instruments were of an astound-
ing blackness, it seemed as though the space-
ship was diving into the very heart of uni-
versal 
darkness. 
The side telescopes 
still 
showed needles of light from countless stars. 

Ingrid's nerves tingled with a strange sen-
sation of alarm. She returned to her machines 
and telescopes, again and again checked their 
readings as she mapped the unknown area. 
Everything was quiet but still Ingrid could 
not take her eyes off the malignant blackness 
ahead of the ship. Kay Bear noticed her 

anxiety and for a long time studied and lis-
tened to the instruments. 

"I don't see anything," he said at last. 
"Aren't you imagining things?" 

" I 
don't 
know why, but that 
unusual 
blackness ahead of us bothers me. It seems 
to me that our ship is diving straight into a 
dark nebula." 

"There should be a dark cloud 
here," 
Kay Bear agreed, "but we shall only scratch 
the edge of it. That's what was calculated! 
The strength of the gravitational field is 
increasing slowly and regularly. On our way 
through this area we should pass close to 
some centre of gravity. What does it matter 
whether it's light or dark?" 

"That's 
true enough," admitted 
Ingrid, 
more calmly. 

"We've got the finest commander and offi-
cers there are. We're proceeding along a set 
course even faster than was computed. 
If 
there are no changes we'll be out of our 
trouble and we'll get safely to Triton despite 
our short supply of anameson." 

Even at the thought of the spaceship's 
station on Triton, Neptune's satellite on the 
fringe of the solar system, Ingrid felt much 
happier. To reach Triton would mean that 
they were home. 

"I was hoping we'd be able to work on the 
symphony together but Lynn's asleep. He'll 
sleep six or seven hours so I'll think over 
the orchestration of the coda of the second 
movement—you know, the place where we 
couldn't find a means of expressing the in-

tegrated accession of the menace. This piece..." 
Kay sang a few notes. 

"Tee-ee-e, tee-ee-e, ta-rara-ra," came the 
immediate response from the very walls of 
the control tower. Ingrid started and looked 
round, but a moment later realized what it 
was. There had been an increase in the force 
of gravity and the instruments had responded 
by 
changing the melody of the artificial 
gravitation apparatus. 

"What an amusing coincidence," laughed 
Ingrid, with an air of guilt. 

"There is stronger gravitation, as there 
should be in a black cloud. Now you can calm 
yourself 
altogether 
and 
let 
Lynn 
sleep." 

Kay 
Bear 
left the control 
tower 
and 
entered the brightly-lit library where he sat 
down at a tiny electronic violin-piano. He was 
soon deeply immersed in his work and, no 
doubt, several hours must have passed before 
the hermetically sealed door of the library 
flew open and Ingrid appeared. 

"Kay, please wake up Lynn." 
"What's wrong?" 
"The strength of the gravitation field is 
much more than was computed." 

"What is ahead of us?" 
"The same blackness!" 
Ingrid went out. 

Kay Bear woke the astronavigator, who 
jumped up and ran to the instruments in the 
control tower. 

"There's 
nothing 
especially 
dangerous. 
Only where does such a gravitational field 
come from in this area? It's too strong for a 
black cloud and there are no stars here." 

Lynn thought for a time and then pressed 
the knob to awaken the commander of the 
expedition 
and 
after 
another 
moment's 
thought pressed the knob of Nisa Creet's 
cabin as well. 

" I f 
nothing extraordinary 
happens they 
can simply take over their watch," Lynn ex-
plained to the anxious Ingrid. 

"And 
if something 
does 
happen? 
Erg 
Noor won't return to normal for another 
five hours. What shall we do?" 

"Wait quietly," answered the astronavi-
gator. "What can happen here in five hours 
when we are so far from all stellar systems?" 

The tone of the measuring instruments 
grew lower and lower telling of the constant-
ly changing flight conditions. The tense wait-
ing dragged out endlessly. Two hours drag-
ged by so slowly that they seemed like a 
whole watch. Outwardly Pel Lynn was still 
calm but Ingrid's anxiety had already infected 
Kay Bear. He kept looking at the control-
tower door expecting Erg Noor to appear 
with his usual rapid movements although he 
knew that the awakening from prolonged 
sleep is a lengthy process. 

The long ringing of a bell caused them all 
to start. Ingrid grasped hold of Kay Bear. 

Tantra was in danger! The gravitation was 
double the computed figure! 

The astronavigator turned pale. The unex-
pected 
had happened and an 
immediate 
decision was essential. The fate of the space-
ship was in his hands. The steadily increasing 
gravitational pull made a reduction in speed 

necessary, both because of increasing weight 
in the ship and an apparent accumulation of 
solid matter in the ship's path. But after 
reducing speed what would they use for 
further acceleration? Pel Lynn clenched his 
teeth and turned the lever that started the 
ion trigger motors used for braking. Gong-
like sounds disturbed the melody of the mea-
suring instruments and drowned the alarming 
ring of those recording the ratio of gravita-
tional pull to velocity. The ringing ceased and 
the indicators showed that speed had been 
reduced to a safe level and was normal for the 
growing gravitation. But no sooner had Pel 
Lynn switched off the brake motors than the 
bells began ringing again. Obviously the space-
ship was flying directly into a powerful gra-
vitation centre which was slowing it down. 

The astronavigator did not dare change the 
course that 
had been plotted with such 
great difficulty and absolute precision. He 
used the planetary motors to brake the ship 
again although it was already clear that there 
had been an error in plotting the course and 
that it lay through an unknown mass of matter. 

"The 
gravitational 
field is very great," 
said Ingrid softly. "Perhaps..." 

"We must slow down still more so as to 
be able to turn," exclaimed the navigator, 
"but what can we accelerate with after that?.." 
There was a note of fatal hesitancy in his 
words. 

"We have already passed the zone of outer 
vortices," 
Ingrid told him, "gravitation is 
increasing rapidly all the time." 

The 
frequent 
clatter 
of 
the 
planetary 
motors 
resounded through 
the ship; the 
electronic ship's pilot switched them 
on 
automatically as it felt a huge accumulation 
of solid matter ahead of them. Tantra began 
to pitch and toss. No matter how much the 
ship's speed was reduced the people in the 
control tower began to lose consciousness. 
Ingrid fell to her knees. Pel Lynn, sitting in 
his chair, tried to raise a head as heavy as lead. 
Kay Bear experienced a mixture of unreason-
ing brute fear and puerile helplessness. 

The thuds of the motors increased in fre-
quency until they merged into a continual 
roar—the electronic brain had taken up the 
struggle in place of its semi-conscious masters: 
it was a powerful brai n but it had its limits, 
it could not foretell all possible complications 
and find a way out of unusual situations. 

The tossing abated. The indicators showed 
that the supply of ion charges for the motors 
was 
dropping 
with 
catastrophic 
rapidity. 
As Pel Lynn came to he realized that the 
strange increase of gravity was taking place 
so fast that urgent measures had to be taken 
to stop the ship and then make a complete 
change of course away from the black void. 

Pel Lynn turned the handle switching on 
the anameson motors. Four tall cylinders of 
boron nitride that could be seen through a 
slit in the control desk were lit up from in-
side. A bright green flame beat inside them 
with lightning speed, it flowed and whirled 
in four tight spirals. Up forward, in the nose 
of the spaceship, a strong magnetic field 

enveloped the motor jets, saving them from 
instantaneous destruction. 

The astronavigator moved the handle far-
ther—through 
the whirling green wall 
of 
light 
a directing 
ray appeared, a greyish 
stream of K-particles.9 Another movement 
and the grey stream was cut by a blinding 
flash of violet lightning, a signal that the ana-
meson had begun its tempestuous emission. 
The huge bulk of the spaceship respond-
ed with 
an almost inaudible, 
unbearable, 
high-frequency vibration... 

Erg Noor had eaten the necessary amount 
of food and was lying half-asleep enjoying 
the indescribably pleasurable sensation of an 
electric nerve massage. The trance-like state 
of semi-consciousness that still covered his 
mind and body left him very slowly. The 
music of animation changed to a major key 
and to a rhythm that increased in rapidity... 

Suddenly 
something 
evil 
coming 
from 
without interrupted the joy of awakening 
from a ninety-day sleep. Erg Noor realized 
that he was commander of the expedition 
and struggled desperately to get back to nor-
mal consciousness. At last he realized that 
the spaceship was being braked and that the 
anameson motors were switched on, all of 
which 
meant that 
something serious had 
occurred. He tried to get up. His body still 
would not obey his will, his legs doubled un-
der him and he collapsed like a sack on the 
floor 
of 
his cabin. 
After 
some time he 
managed to crawl to the door and open it. 

Consciousness was breaking through the mist 
of sleep—in the corridor he rose on all fours 
and made his way into the control tower. 

The people staring at the screens and in-
strument dials looked round in alarm and 
then ran to their commander. He was not 
yet able to stand but he muttered: 

"The screens ... the forward screens ... 
switch over to infra-red... stop the motors!" 

The borason cylinders were extinguished 
at the same time as the vibration of the ship's 
hull ceased. A gigantic star, burning with a 
dull reddish-brown light, appeared on the 
forward star-board screen. For a moment they 
were all flabbergasted and could not take 
their eyes off the enormous disc that emerged 
from the darkness directly ahead of the space-
ship. 

"Oh, what a fool!" exclaimed Pel Lynn 
bitterly. " I was sure we were in a dark nebula! 
And that's..." 

"An iron star!" exclaimed Ingrid Dietra 
in horror. 

Erg Noor, holding on to the back of a 
chair, stood up. His usually pale face had a 
bluish tinge to it but his eyes gleamed bright-
ly with their usual fire. 

"Yes, that's an iron star," he said slowly 
and the eyes of all those in the room turned 
to him in fear and hope, "the terror of astro-
nauts! Nobody suspected that there would 
be one in this area." 

"I only thought about a nebula," Pel Lynn 
said softly and guiltily. 

" A dark nebula with such a gravitational 

field 
would 
contain 
comparatively 
large 
solid particles and Tantra would have been 
destroyed already. It would be impossible 
to avoid a collision in such a swarm," said 
the commander in a calm, firm voice. 

"But 
these 
sharp gravitational 
changes 
and these vortex things—aren't they a direct 
indication of a cloud?" 

"Or that the star has a planet, perhaps 
more than one..." 

The astronavigator bit his lip so badly 
that it began to bleed. The commander nod-
ded his head encouragingly and himself press-
ed the buttons to awaken the others. 

" A report of observations as quickly as 
possible! We'll work out the gravitation con-
tours." 

The spaceship began to rock again. Some-
thing flashed across the screen with colossal 
speed, something of terrific size that passed 
behind them and disappeared. 

"There's the answer, we've overtaken the 
planet. Hurry up, hurry up, get the work 
done!" The commander's glance fell on the 
fuel supply indicators. His hands gripped the 
back of the chair more tightly, he was going 
to say something but refrained. 

Chapter Two 

EPSILON T U C A N A E 

The faint tinkle of glass that came from the 
table was accompanied by orange and blue 
lights. Varicoloured lights sparkled up and 
down the transparent partition. Darr Veter, 
Director of the Outer Stations of the Great 
Circle, was observing the lights on the Spiral 
Way. Its huge arc curved into the heights 
and scored a dull yellow line along the sea-
coast. Keeping his eyes on the Way, Darr 
Veter stretched out his hand and turned a 
lever to point M, ensuring himself solitude 
for meditation. A great change had on that 
day come into his life. His successor Mven 
Mass, chosen by the Astronautical Council, 
had arrived that morning from the southern 
residential belt. They would carry out his 
last transmission round the Circle together 

and then ... it was precisely this "then" that 
had not yet been decided upon. For six years 
he had been doing a job that required super-
human effort, work for which the Council 
selected special people, those who were out-
standing for their splendid memories and 
encyclopaedic knowledge. When attacks of 
complete indifference to work and to life 
began recurring with ominous frequency— 
and this is one of the most serious ailments 
in 
man—he had been examined by 
Evda 
Nahl, a noted psychiatrist. A tried remedy-
sad strains of minor music in a room of blue 
dreams saturated with pacifying waves—did 
not help. The only thing left was to change 
his work and take a course of physical labour, 
any sort of work that required daily, hourly 
muscular effort. His best friend, Veda Kong, 
the historian, had offered him an opportunity 
to do archaeological work with her. Machines 
could not do all the excavation work, the last 
stages required human hands. There was no 
lack of volunteers but still Veda had promised 
him a long trip to the region of the ancient 
steppes where he would be close to na-
ture. 

If only Veda Kong ... but of course, he 
knew the whole story. Veda was in love with 
Erg Noor, Member of the Astronautical Coun-
cil and Commander of Cosmic 
Expedition 
No. 37. There should have been a message 
from Erg Noor—from the planet Zirda he 
should have reported and said whether he 
was going farther. But if no message had 
come—and all space flights were computed 

with the greatest precision—then ... but no, 
he must not think of winning Veda's love! 
The Vector of Friendship, that was all, that 
was 
the greatest tie that there could be be-
tween them. Nevertheless he would go and 
work for her. 

Darr Veter moved a lever, pressed a button 
and the room was flooded with light. A crys-
tal-glass window formed one of the walls 
of a room situated high above land and sea, 
giving a view over a great distance. With a 
turn of another lever Darr Veter caused the 
window to drop inwards leaving the room 
open to the starry sky; the metal frame of 
the window shut out from his view the lights 
of the Spiral Way and 
the buildings and 
lighthouses on the sea-coast. 

Veter's eyes were fixed on the hands of 
the galactic clock with three concentric rings 
marked in subdivisions. The transmission of 
information round the Great Circle followed 
galactic time, once in every hundred-thou-
sandth of a galactic second, or once in eight 
days, 45 times a year according to terrestrial 
time. One revolution of the Galaxy around 
its axis was one day of galactic time. 

The next and, for him, the last transmis-
sion would be at 9 a.m. Tibetan Mean Time or 
at 2 a.m. at the Mediterranean Observatory of 
the Council. A little more than two hours still 
remained. 

The instrument on the table tinkled and 
flashed again. A man in light-coloured cloth-
ing made of some material with a silk-like 
sheen appeared from behind the partition. 

"We are ready to transmit and receive," he 
said briefly, showing no outward signs of 
respect 
although 
in 
his eyes one 
could 
read admiration for his Director. Darr Veter 
did not say a word, nor did his assistant 
who stood there in a proud, unrestrained 
pose. 

"In the Cubic Hall?" asked Veter at last, 
and, getting an answer in the affirmative, 
asked where Mven Mass was. 

"He is in the Morning Freshness Room, 
getting tuned up after his journey and, apart 
from that, I think he's a bit excited." 

"I'd 
be excited myself if I were in his 
place!" said Darr Veter, thoughtfully. "That's 
how I felt six years ago." 

The assistant was flushed from his effort 
to preserve his outward calm. With all the 
fire of youth he was sorry for his chief, 
perhaps he even realized that some day he, 
too, would live through the joys and sorrows 
of great work and great responsibility. The 
Director of the Outer Stations did not in any 
way show his feelings for to do so at his age 
was not considered decent. 

"When 
Mven 
Mass appears, bring 
him 
straight to me." 

The assistant left the room. Darr Veter 
walked over to one corner where the transpar-
ent partition was blackened from floor to 
ceiling and with an easy movement opened 
two shutters in a panel of polished wood. 
A light appeared, coming from somewhere in 
the depths of a mirror-like screen. It did not, 
however, possess the gloss of a mirror—it 

gave the impression of a long corridor leading 
into the far distance. 

Using selected switches the Director of 
the Outer Stations switched on the Vector 
of Friendship, a system of direct commu-
nication between people linked by the ties 
of profound friendship that enabled them 
to contact each other at any moment. The 
Vector of Friendship was connected with a 
number of places where the person con-
cerned was likely to be—his house, his place 
of 
work, 
his favourite 
recreation 
centre. 

The screen grew light and in the depths 
there appeared familiar panels with columns 
of coded titles of electronic films that had 
succeeded the ancient photocopies of books. 
When all mankind adopted a single alphabet-
it was called the linear alphabet because there 
were no complicated signs in it—it became 
easy to film even the old books, so that 
eventually the process was fully mechanized. 
The blue, green and red stripes were the sym-
bols of the central film libraries where scien-
tific research works were stored, works that 
had for centuries been published only in a 
dozen copies. 
It was merely necessary to 
select the code number and symbols and the 
film library would transmit, automatically, 
the full text of the book. This machine was 
Veda's private library. A snap of switches and 
the picture faded, it was followed by another 
room which was also empty. Another switch 
connected the screen with a hall in which 
stood a number 
of 
dimly 
lighted desks. 
The woman seated at the nearest desk raised 

h£r head and Darr Veter recognized the thick, 
widely separated eyebrows and the sweet, 
narrow face with its grey eyes. As she smiled, 
white teeth flashed in a big mouth with bold 
lines and her cheeks were chubbily rounded 
on either side of a slightly snub nose with 
a childish, round tip to it that made the face 
gentle and kindly. 

"Veda, there are two hours left. You have 
to change and I would like you to come to 
the observatory a little before time." 

The woman on the screen raised her hands 
to her thick, ash-blonde hair. 

"I obey, my Veter," she smiled. "I'm going 
home." 

Veter's ear was not deceived by the gay-
ness of her tones. 

"Brave Veda, calm yourself. 
Everybody 
who speaks to the Great Circle has to make a 
first appearance." 

"Don't waste words consoling me," said 
Veda Kong, raising her head with a stubborn 
gesture. "I'll be there soon." 

The screen went dark. Darr Veter closed 
the shutters and turned to meet his successor. 
Mven 
Mass entered the 
room 
with 
long 
strides. The cast of his features and his 
smooth, dark-brown skin showed that he was 
descended from African ancestors. A white 
mantle fell from his powerful shoulders in 
heavy folds. 
Mven 
Mass took 
both 
Darr 
Veter's hands in his strong, thin ones. The 
two Directors of the Outer Space Stations, 
the new and the old, were both very tall. 
Veter, whose genealogy 
led back to the 

Russian people, seemed broader and more 
massive than the graceful African. 

" I t seems to me that something impor-
tant ought to happen today," began Mven 
Mass, with that trusting sincerity that was 
typical of the people who lived in the Era 
of the Great Circle. Darr Veter shrugged his 
shoulders. 

"Important things will happen for three 
people. I am handing over my work, you are 
taking it from me and Veda Kong will speak 
to the Universe for the first time." 

"Is she very beautiful?" responded Mven 
Mass, half questioning, half affirming. 

"You'll see her. By the way, there's no-
thing 
special 
about 
today's 
transmission. 
Veda will give a lecture on our history for 
planet KRZ 664456 + BS 3252." 

Mven Mass made an astonishingly rapid 
mental calculation. 

"Constellation of the Unicorn, star Ross 
614, its planetary system has been known 
from time immemorial but has never in any 
way distinguished itself. I love the old names 
and old words," he added with a scarcely 
detectable note of apology. 

"The Council knows how to select people," 
Darr Veter thought to himself. Aloud he said: 

"Then you'll get on well with Junius An-
tus, the Director of the Electronic Memory 
Machines. He calls himself the Director of 
the Memory Lamps. He is not thinking of 
the lamps they used for light in ancient days 
but of those first electronic devices in clum-
sy glass envelopes with the air pumped out 

of them; they looked just 
like the electric 
lamps of those days." 

Mven Mass laughed so heartily and frank-
ly that Darr Veter could feel his liking for 
the man growing fast. 

"Memory 
lamps! Our memory 
network 
consists of kilometres of corridors furnished 
with billions of cell elements." He suddenly 
checked himself. "I'm letting my feeling run 
away with me and haven't yet found out 
essential things. When did 
Ross 614 first 
speak?" 

"Fifty-two years ago. Since then they have 
mastered the language of the Great Circle. 
They are only four parsecs away from us. 
They will get Veda's lecture in thirteen years' 
time." 

"And then?" 
"After the lecture we shall go over to 
reception. We shall get some news from the 
Great Circle through our old friends." 

"Through 61 Cygni?" 
"Of 
course. Sometimes we get contact 
through 107 Ophiuchi, to use the old termi-
nology." 

A man in the same silvery uniform of the 
Astronautical Council as that worn by Veter's 
assistant entered the room. He was of medium 
height, sprightly and aquiline-nosed; people 
liked him for the keenly attentive glance of 
his jet-black eyes. The newcomer stroked 
his round hairless head. 

" I ' m Junius Antus," he said, apparently 
to 
Mven 
Mass. The African greeted him 
respectfully. The Directors of the Memory 

Machines exceeded everybody else in eru-
dition. They decided what had to be perpe-
tuated by the machines and what would be 
sent out as general information or used by 
the Palaces of Creative Effort. 

"Another brevus," 
muttered Junius Antus, 
shaking hands with his new acquaintance. 

"What's 
that?" 
inquired 
Mven 
Mass. 

" A Latin appellation I have thought up. 
I give that name to all those who do not live 
long—vita breva, you know—workers on the 
Outer 
Stations, 
pilots 
of 
the 
Interstellar 
Space 
Fleet, technicians at the spaceship 
engine plants... And ... er... you and I. We do 
not live more than half our allotted life-span, 
either. We can't do much about that, but we 
live interesting lives. Where's Veda?" 

"She 
intended 
coming earlier..." 
began 
Darr Veter. His words were drowned 
by 
disturbing chords of music that followed a 
loud click on the dial of the galactic clock. 

"Warning for all Earth. All power-stations, 
all 
factories, 
transport 
and 
radiostations! 
In half an hour from now cease the consump-
tion of all energy and accumulate it in high-
capacity condensers till there is enough for 
a radiation channel to penetrate the atmos-
phere. The transmission will take 43 percent 
of 
Earth's power resources. The reception 
will need only 8 per cent for the mainten-
ance of the channel," explained Darr Veter. 

"That's just as I imagined it would be," 
said Mven Mass, nodding his head. Sudden-
ly his concentrated glance livened up and his 
face 
glowed 
with admiration. 
Darr 
Veter 

looked round. Unobserved by them Veda 
Kong had arrived and was standing beside a 
luminescent 
column. 
For 
her lecture she 
had donned the costume that adds mostly 
to the beauty of women, a costume invented 
thousands of years before at the time of the 
Cretan Civilization. The heavy knot of ash-
blonde hair piled high on the back of her 
head did not detract from her strong and 
graceful neck. Her smooth shoulders were 
bare and her neckline was cut very low, 
revealing a high 
bosom, supported by a 
corsage of blue cloth. A wide, short silver 
skirt embroidered with blue flowers, exposed 
bare, suntanned legs in slippers of cherry-
coloured 
silk. 
Big cherry-coloured 
stones 
brought from Venus, set with careful crude-
ness in a gold chain, were like balls of fire on 
her soft skin and matched cheeks and tiny 
ears 
that 
were flaming with 
excitement. 

Mven Mass met the learned historian for 
the first time and he gazed at her in frank 
admiration. 

Veda 
lifted her troubled eyes to 
Darr 
Veter. 

"Very 
nice," he said in answer to his 
friend's unspoken question. 

"I've spoken to many audiences, but not 
like this," she said. 

"The Council is following a custom. Com-
munications 
for 
the different planets are 
always read by beautiful women. This gives 
them an impression of the sense of the beau-
tiful as perceived by the inhabitants of our 
world, and in general it tells them a lot," 

continued Darr Veter. 

"The Council is not mistaken in its choice!" 
exclaimed Mven Mass. 

Veda gave the African a penetrating look. 
"Are you a bachelor?" she asked softly 
and, acknowledging Mven Mass's nod of af-
firmation, smiled. 

"You wanted to talk to me?" she asked, 
turning to Darr Veter. The friends went out 
on to the circular verandah and Veda wel-
comed the touch of the fresh sea freeze on 
her face. 

The Director of the Outer Stations told 
her of his decision to go to the dig; he told 
her of the way he had wavered between the 
38th Cosmic Expedition, the Antarctic sub-
marine mines and archaeology. 

"Anything, but not the Cosmic Expedi-
tion!" exclaimed Veda and Darr Veter felt 
that he had been rather tactless. Carried away 
by 
his own feelings 
he had accidentally 
touched the sore spot in Veda's heart. 

He was helped out by the melody of dis-
turbing chords that reached the verandah. 

"It's time to go. In half an hour we'll be 
on the air through the Great Circle!" 

Darr Veter took Veda Kong carefully by 
the arm. Accompanied by the others they 
went down an escalator to a deep under-
ground chamber, the Cubic Hall, carved out 
of living rock. 

There was little in the hall but instruments. 
The dull black walls had the appearance of 
velvet divided into panels by clean lines of 
crystal. Gold, green, blue and orange lights 

lit up the dials, signs and figures. The emerald 
green points of needles trembled on black 
semicircles, giving the broad walls an appear-
ance 
of 
strained, 
quivering 
expectation. 

The furniture consisted of a few chairs 
and a big blackwood table, one end of which 
was pushed into a huge hemispherical screen 
the colour of mother-of-pearl set in a massive 
gold frame. 

Veda Kong and Mven Mass examined every-
thing with rapt attention for this was their 
first visit to the observatory of the Outer 
Stations. 

Darr Veter beckoned to Mven Mass and 
pointed 
to 
high black armchairs for the 
others. The African came towards him, walk-
ing on the balls of his feet, just as his ances-
tors had once walked in the sunbaked savan-
nas on the trail of huge, savage animals. 
Mven Mass held his breath. Out of this deeply-
hidden stone vault a window would soon be 
opened into the endless spaces of the Cosmos 
and people would join their thoughts and 
their knowledge to that of their brothers in 
other worlds. This tiny group of five represent-
ed terrestrial mankind before the whole Uni-
verse. And from the next day on, he, Mven 
Mass, would be in charge of these communi-
cations. He was to be entrusted with the con-
trol of that tremendous power. A slight shiver 
ran down his back. He had probably only at 
that moment realized what a burden of res-
ponsibility he had undertaken when he had 
accepted 
the 
Council's 
proposal. 
As 
he 
watched Darr Veter manipulating the control 

switches something of the admiration that 
burned in the eyes of Darr Veter's young 
assistant could be seen in his. 

A 
deep, 
ominous 
rumble sounded, as 
though a huge gong had been struck. Darr 
Veter turned around swiftly and threw over a 
long lever. The gong ceased and Veda Kong 
noticed that a narrow panel on the right-
hand wall had lit up from floor to ceiling. 
The wall seemed to have disappeared into the 
unfathomable 
distance. 
The 
phantom-like 
outlines of a pyramidal mountain surmount-
ed by a gigantic stone ring appeared. Below 
the cap of molten stone, patches of pure 
white mountain snow lay here and there. 

Mven Mass recognized the second highest 
mountain in Africa, Mount Kenya. 

Again the strokes of the gong resounded 
through the underground chamber making 
all present alert and compelling them 
to 
concentrate. 

Darr Veter took Mven's hand and placed 
it on a handle in which a ruby eye glowed. 
Mven obediently turned the handle as far as 
it would go. All the power produced on Earth 
by 1,760 gigantic power-stations was being 
concentrated on the equator, on a mountain 
5,000 metres high. A multi-coloured lumines-
cence appeared over the peak, formed a 
sphere and then surged upwards in a spear-
headed column that pierced the very depths 
of the sky. Like the narrow column of a 
whirlwind it remained poised over the glassy 
sphere, and over its surface, climbing upwards, 
ran a spiral of dazzlingly brilliant blue smoke. 

The directed rays cut a regular channel 
through Earth's atmosphere that acted as a 
line of communication between Earth and the 
Outer Stations. At a height of 36,000 kilo-
metres above Earth hung the diurnal satel-
lite, a giant station that revolved around 
Earth's axis once in twenty-four hours and 
kept in the plane of the equator so that to 
all intents and purposes it stood motionless 
over Mount Kenya in East Africa, the point 
that had been selected for permanent commu-
nications with the Outer Stations. There was 
another 
satellite, 
Number 
57, 
revolving 
around the 90th meridian at a height of 
57,000 kilometres and communicating with 
the 
Tibetan 
Receiving 
and 
Transmitting 
Observatory. The conditions for the forma-
tion of a transmission channel were better 
at the Tibetan station but communication 
was not constant. These two giant satellites 
also maintained contact with a number of 
automatic stations situated at various points 
round Earth. 

The narrow panel on the right went dark, 
a signal that the transmission channel had 
connected with the receiving station of the 
satellite. Then the gold-framed, pearl screen 
lit up. In its centre appeared a monstrously 
enlarged figure that grew clearer and then 
smiled with a big mouth. This was Goor 
Hahn, one of the observers on the diurnal 
satellite, whose picture on the screen grew 
rapidly to fantastic proportions. He cheer-
fully nodded and stretched out a ten-foot arm 
to switch on all the Outer Stations around our 

planet. They were linked up in one circuit 
by the power transmitted from Earth. The 
sensitive eyes of receivers turned in all direc-
tions into the Universe. The planet of a dull 
red star in the Unicorn Constellation that had 
shortly before sent out a call, had a better 
contact 
with 
Satellite 
57 
and 
Goor 
Hahn switched over to it. This invisible con-
tact between Earth and the planet of another 
star would last for three-quarters of an hour 
and not a moment of that valuable time could 
be lost. 

Veda Kong, at a sign from Darr Veter, 
stood before the screen on a gleaming round 
metal dais. Invisible rays poured down from 
above and noticeably deepened the suntan 
of 
her skin. 
Electronic 
machines worked 
soundlessly as they translated her words into 
the language of the Great Circle. In thirteen 
years' time the receivers on the planet of the 
dull-red star would write down the incoming 
oscillations in universal symbols and electron-
ic 
machines would 
translate the symbols 
into the living speech of the planet's inhabi-
tants (providing that they use speech). 

"All the same, it is a pity that those dis-
tant beings will not hear the soft melodious 
voice of a woman of Earth and will not under-
stand its expressiveness," thought Darr Veter. 
"Who knows how their ears may be construct-
ed, they may possess quite a different type 
of hearing. But vision, which uses that part 
of the electromagnetic oscillations capable 
of penetrating the atmosphere, is almost the 
same throughout the Universe and they will 

behold the charming Veda in her flush of 
excitement..." 

Darr Veter did not take his eyes off 
Veda's tiny ear, partly covered by a lock of 
hair, while he listened to her lecture. 

Briefly but clearly Veda Kong spoke of 
the chief stages in the history of mankind. 
She spoke of the early epochs of man's 
existence, when there were numerous large 
and small nations that were in constant con-
flict owing to the economic and ideological 
hostility that divided their countries. She 
spoke very briefly and gave the era the name 
of the Era of Disunity. People living in the 
Era of the Great Circle were not interested 
in lists of destructive wars and horrible suf-
ferings 
or 
the so-called great rulers that 
filled the ancient history books. More im-
portant to them was the development of 
productive forces and the forming of ideas, 
the history of art and knowledge and the 
struggle to create a real man, the way in 
which the creative urge had been developed, 
and people had arrived at new conceptions of 
the world, of social relations and of the duty, 
rights and happiness of man, conceptions that 
had nurtured the mighty tree of communist 
society that flourished throughout the planet. 

During the last century of the Era of Dis-
unity, known as the Fission Age, people had 
at last begun to understand that their misfor-
tunes were due to a social structure that had 
originated in times of savagery; they rea-
lized that all their strength, all the future of 
mankind, lay in labour, in the correlated 

efforts of millions of free people, in science 
and in a new way of life based on scientific 
principles. Men came to understand the basic 
laws of social development, the dialectically 
contradictory course of history and the neces-
sity to train people in the spirit of strict so-
cial discipline, something that became of 
greater importance as the population of the 
planet increased. 

In the Fission Age the struggle between 
old and new ideas had become more acute 
and had led to the division of the world into 
two camps—the old and the new states with 
differing economic systems. The first kinds 
of atomic energy had been discovered by that 
time but the stubbornness of those who 
championed the old order had almost led 
mankind into a colossal catastrophe. 

The new social system was bound to win 
although victory was delayed on account of 
the difficulty of training people in the new 
spirit. The rebuilding of the world on com-
munist 
lines entailed 
a radical 
economic 
change accompanied by the disappearance 
of poverty, hunger and heavy, exhausting toil. 
The changes brought about in economy made 
necessary an intricate system to direct pro-
duction and distribution and could only be 
put into effect by the inculcation of social 
consciousness in every person. 

Communist society had not been estab-
lished in all countries and amongst all nations 
simultaneously. 
A 
tremendous 
effort 
had 
been required to eliminate the hostility and, 
especially, the lies that had remained from 

the propaganda prevalent during the ideolog-
ical 
struggle 
of 
the 
Fission 
Age. 
Many 
mistakes had been made in this period when 
new human relations were developing. Here 
and there insurrections had been raised by 
backward people who worshipped the past 
and who, in their ignorance, saw a way out 
of man's difficulties in a return to that past. 

With inevitable persistence the new way 
of life had spread over the entire Earth and 
the many races and nations were united into 
a single friendly and wise family. 

Thus began the next era, the Era of World 
Unity, consisting of four ages—the Age of 
Alliance, the Age of Lingual Disunity, the 
Age of Power Development and the Age of 
the Common Tongue. 

Society developed more rapidly and each 
new age passed more speedily than the pre-
ceding one as man's power over nature pro-
gressed with giant steps. 

In the ancient Utopian dreams of a happy 
future 
great importance 
was attached to 
man's gradual liberation from the necessity 
to work. The Utopians promised man an 
abundance 
of 
all he needed for a short 
working day of two or three hours and the 
rest of his time he could devote to doing 
nothing, to the dolce far niente of the novel-
ists. This fantasy, naturally, arose out of 
man's abhorrence of the arduous, exhaust-
ing toil of ancient days. 

People soon realized that happiness can 
derive 
from 
labour, from a never-ceasing 
struggle against nature, the overcoming of 

difficulties and the solution of ever new 
problems arising out of the development of 
science and economy. Man needed to work 
to the full measure of his strength but his 
labour had to be creative and in accordance 
with 
his natural 
talents and 
inclinations, 
and it had to be varied and changed from time 
to time. The development of cybernetics, 
the technique of automatic control, a compre-
hensive education and the development of 
intellectual abilities, coupled with the finest 
physical training of each individual, made it 
possible for a person to change his profes-
sion frequently, 
learn another easily and 
bring endless variety into his work so that it 
became more and more satisfying. Progres-
sively expanding science embraced all aspects 
of life and a growing number of people came 
to know the joy of the creator, the discoverer 
of new secrets of nature. Art played a great 
part in social education and in forming the 
new way of life. Then came the most magnif-
icent 
era 
in 
man's 
history, the 
Era 
of 
Common Labour consisting of four ages, the 
Age of Simplification, the Age of Realign-
ment, the Age of the First Abundance and the 
Age of the Cosmos. 

A technical revolution of the new period 
was the invention of concentrated electricity 
with its high-capacity accumulators and tiny 
electric motors. Before this, man had learned 
to use semi-conductors 
in intricate weak-
current circuits for his automated cybernetic 
machines. The work of the mechanic became 
as delicate as that of the jeweller but at the 

same time it served to subordinate energy on 
a Cosmic scale. 

The demand that everybody should have 
everything 
required 
the 
simplification 
of 
articles of everyday use. Man ceased to be 
the slave of his possessions, and the elabora-
tion of standard components enabled arti-
cles and machines to be produced in great 
variety from a comparatively small number of 
elements 
in the same way 
as the great 
variety of living organisms is made up of a 
small number of different cells: the cells 
consist of albumins, the albumins come from 
proteins and so on. Feeding in former ages 
had been so wasteful that its rationalization 
made it easy to feed, without detriment, a 
population that had increased by thousands 
of millions. 

All the forces of society that had formerly 
been expended on the creation of war ma-
chines, on the maintenance of huge armies 
that did no useful labour and on propagan-
da and its trumpery, were channelled into 
improving man's way of life and promoting 
scientific knowledge. 

At a sign from Veda Kong, Darr Veter 
pressed a button and a huge globe rose up 
beside her. 

"We 
began," 
continued 
the 
beautiful 
historian, "with the complete redistribution 
of Earth's surface into dwelling and industrial 
zones. 

"The brown stripes running between thirty 
and forty degrees of North and South lati-
tude represent an unbroken chain of urban 

settlements built on the shores of warm seas 
with a mild climate and no winters. Mankind 
no longer spends huge quantities of energy 
warming houses in winter and making him-
self clumsy clothing. The greatest concentra-
tion of people is around the cradle of human 
civilization, 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea. 
The 
subtropical belt was doubled in breadth after 
the ice on the polar caps had been melted. To 
the north of the zone of habitation lie prairies 
and meadows where countless herds of do-
mestic animals graze. 

"The production of food-stuffs and trees 
for timber is confined to the tropical belt 
where it is a thousand times more profitable 
than in the colder climatic zones. Ever since 
the discovery was made that carbohydrates, 
the sugars, could be obtained artificially from 
sunlight and carbonic acid, agriculture has no 
longer had to produce all man's food. Prac-
tically speaking, there is no limit to the quan-
tities of sugars, fats and vitamins that we can 
produce. For the production of proteins alone 
we have huge land areas and huge fields of 
seaweed at our disposal. Mankind has been 
freed from the fear of hunger that had been 
hanging over it for tens of thousands of years. 

"One of man's greatest pleasures is travel, 
an urge to move from place to place that we 
have inherited from our distant forefathers, 
the wandering hunters and gatherers of scanty 
food. Today the entire planet is encircled by 
the Spiral Way whose gigantic bridges link 
all the continents." Veda ran her finger along 
a silver thread and turned the globe round. 

"Electric trains move along the Spiral Way all 
the time and hundreds of thousands of people 
can leave the inhabited zone very speedily 
for the prairies, open fields, mountains or 
forests. 

" A t last the planned organization of life 
put an end to the murderous race for higher 
speeds, the construction of faster and faster 
vehicles. Trains on the Spiral Way proceed at 
200 kilometres an hour. Only on rare occa-
sions do we use aircraft with a speed of 
thousands of kilometres an hour. 

" A few centuries ago we made extensive 
improvements to the surface of our planet. 
The energy of the atomic nucleus had been 
discovered long before, in the Fission Age, 
when man learned to liberate a tiny part of 
its energy to produce a burst of heat but with 
the harmful radiation of the fall-out. It was 
soon realized that this meant danger to life 
on the planet and nuclear power possibilities 
were greatly curtailed. Almost at the same 
time astronomers studying the physics of 
distant stars discovered two new ways of 
obtaining nuclear energy, Q and F, that were 
more effective than the old methods and in-
volved no harmful radiation. 

"These two methods are now in use on 
Earth although our spaceships use another 
form of nuclear energy, the anameson fuel, 
that became known to us from our obser-
vations of the great stars of the Galaxy 
through the Great Circle. 

"It was decided to destroy all the stocks 
of thermonuclear 
materials that had been 

accumulating a long time—radioactive 
iso-
topes of uranium, thorium, hydrogen, cobalt 
and lithium—as soon as a method of ejecting 
them beyond Earth's atmosphere had been 
devised. 

"In the Age of Realignment artificial suns 
were made and 'hung' over the north and 
south polar regions. These greatly reduced 
the size of the polar ice-caps that had been 
formed during the ice ages of the Quaternary 
Period and brought about extensive climatic 
changes. The level of the oceans was raised 
by seven metres, the cold fronts receded 
sharply and the ring of trade-winds that had 
dried up the deserts on the outskirts of the 
tropic zone became much weaker. Hurricanes 
and, in general, stormy weather manifesta-
tions ceased almost completely. 

"The warm steppelands spread almost as 
far as the sixtieth parallels north and south 
and beyond them the grasslands and forests 
of the temperate zone passed the seventieth 
parallels. 

"Three-quarters of the Antarctic 
Conti-
nent was freed from ice and proved a trea-
sure-house of minerals that were invaluable 
because resources on the other continents 
had been almost completely exhausted by 
the reckless destruction of metals in the uni-
versal wars of the past. The Spiral Way 
was completed by carrying it across the An-
tarctic. 

"Before this radical change in climate had 
been achieved canals had been dug and moun-
tain chains had had passages cut through them 

to balance out the circulation of air and 
water on the planet. Even the high mountain 
deserts of Asia had been irrigated by constant-
ly operating dielectric pumps. 

"The potential output of food-stuffs had 
grown very considerably and new lands had 
become habitable. 

"The frail and dangerous old planetships, 
poor as they were, enabled us to reach the 
nearest planets of our system. Earth was 
encircled by a belt of artificial satellites from 
which scientists were able to make a close 
study 
of 
the 
Cosmos. 
And 
then, eight 
hundred and eight years ago, there occurred 
an event of such great importance that it 
marked a new era in the history of mankind— 
the Era of the Great Circle. 

"For a long time the human intellect had 
laboured over the transmission of images, 
sounds 
and 
energy 
over great 
distances. 
Hundreds of thousands of the most talented 
scientists worked in a special organization 
that still bears the name of the Academy of 
Direct Radiation. They evolved methods for 
the 
directed transmission 
of 
energy over 
great distances without any form of conduc-
tor. This became possible when ways were 
found to concentrate the stream of energy 
in non-divergent rays. The clusters of parallel 
rays 
then 
transmitted 
provided 
constant 
communication with the artificial satellites, 
and, therefore, with the Cosmos. Long, long 
ago, towards the end of the Era of Disunity, 
our scientists established the fact that power-
ful 
radiation streams were pouring on to 

Earth from 
the 
Cosmos. Calls from 
the 
Cosmos and the transmission round the Great 
Circle of the Universe were reaching us to-
gether with radiation from the other constel-
lation and galaxies. At that time we did not 
understand them although we had learned to 
receive the mysterious signals which we, at 
that time, thought to be natural radiation. 

"Kam Amat, an Indian scientist, got the 
idea of conducting experiments from 
the 
satellites with television receivers and with 
infinite patience tried all possible wavelength 
combinations over a period of dozens of years. 

"Kam Amat caught a transmission from the 
planetary system of the binary star that had 
long been known as 61 Cygni. There ap-
peared on the screen a man, who was not like 
us but was undoubtedly a man, and he 
pointed to an inscription made in the symbols 
of the Great Circle. Another ninety years 
passed before the inscription was read and 
today it is inscribed in our language, the 
language of Earth, on a monument to Kam 
Amat: 'Greetings to you, our brothers, who 
are joining our family. Separated by space and 
time we are united by intellect in the Circle of 
Great Power.' 

"The language of symbols, drawings and 
maps used by the Great Circle proved easy 
to assimilate at the level of development then 
reached by man. In two hundred years we 
were able to use translation machines to con-
verse with the planetary systems of the near-
est stars and to receive and transmit whole 
pictures of the varied life of different worlds. 

We recently received an answer from the 
fourteen planets of Deneb, a first-magnitude 
star and tremendous centre of life in the 
Cygnus; it is 122 parsecs distant from us and 
radiates as much light as 4,800 of our suns. 
Intellectual development there has proceeded 
on different lines but has reached a very 
high level. 

"Strange pictures and symbols come from 
immeasurable 
distances, from 
the ancient 
worlds, from the globular clusters of our 
Galaxy and from the huge inhabited area 
around the Galactic Centre, but we do not 
understand them, and have not yet deci-
phered them. They have been recorded by 
the memory machines and passed on to the 
Academy of the Bounds of Knowledge, an 
institution that works on problems that our 
science can as yet only hint at. We are trying 
to understand ideas that are far from us, 
millions of years ahead of us, ideas that 
differ very greatly from ours due-to life there 
having followed different paths of develop-
ment." 

Veda Kong turned away from the screen 
into which she had been staring as though 
hypnotized and cast an inquiring glance at 
Darr Veter. He smiled and nodded his head 
in approval. Veda proudly raised her head, 
stretched out her arms to those invisible and 
unknown 
beings 
who 
would 
receive 
her 
words and her image thirteen years later. 

"Such is our history, such is the difficult, 
devious and lengthy ascent we have made to 
the heights of knowledge. We appeal to you— 

join us in the Great Circle to carry to the ends 
of 
the tremendous 
Universe the 
gigantic 
oower of the intellect!" 

Veda's voice had a triumphant sound to it, 
as though it were filled with the strength of 
all the generations of the people of Earth 
who had reached such heights that they now 
aspired to send their thoughts beyond the 
bounds of their own Galaxy to other stellar 
islands in the Universe. 

The 
bronze gong sounded as Darr Veter 
turned over the lever that switched off the 
stream of transmitted energy. The screen 
went dark. The luminescent column of the 
conductor channel remained on the transpa-
rent panel on the right. 

Veda, tired and subdued, curled up in the 
depths of her armchair. Darr Veter turned 
the control desk over to Mven Mass and 
leaned over his shoulder to watch him at 
work. The absolute silence was broken only 
by the faint clicks of switches opening and 
closing. 

Suddenly the screen in the gold frame 
disappeared and its place was taken by un-
believable depths of space. It was the first 
time that Veda Kong had seen this marvel and 
she gasped loudly. Even those well acquaint-
ed with the method of the complex inter-
ference of light waves by means of which 
this exceptional expanse and depth of vision 
was achieved, found the spectacle amazing. 

The dark surface of another planet was 
advancing from the distance, growing in size 
with every second. It belonged to an extraor-

dinarily rare system of binary stars in which 
two suns so balanced each other that their 
planet had a regular orbit and life was able 
to emerge on it. The two suns, orange and 
crimson, were smaller than ours, and they 
lit up the ice of a frozen sea that appeared 
crimson in colour. A huge, squat building 
standing on the edge of a chain of flat-topped 
black hills, was visible through a mysterious 
violet haze. The centre of vision was focussed 
on a platform on the roof and then seemed 
to penetrate the building until the watchers 
saw a grey-skinned man with round eyes 
like those of an owl surrounded by a fringe 
of silvery down. He was very tall and exceed-
ingly thin with tentacle-like limbs. The man 
jerked his head ridiculously as though he were 
making a hurried bow, turned listless, lens-
like eyes to the screen and opened a lipless 
mouth that was covered by a flap of soft 
flesh that looked like a nose. 

"Zaph Phthet, Director of External Rela-
tions of 61 Cygni. Today we are transmit-
ting for yellow star STL 3388 + 04 JF... 
We are transmitting for..." came the gentle, 
melodious voice of the translation machine. 

Darr Veter and Junius Antus exchanged 
glances and Mven Mass squeezed Darr Veter's 
wrist for a second. That was the galactic 
call sign of Earth, or rather, of the entire solar 
system, that observers in other worlds had 
formerly regarded as one big planet rotating 
round the Sun once in 59 terrestrial years. 
Once in that period Jupiter and Saturn are 
in opposition which displaces the Sun in the 

visible sky of other systems sufficiently for 
astronomers on the nearer stars to observe. 
Our astronomers made the same mistake in 
respect of many planetary systems that a 
number of stars had long been known to 
possess. 

Junius Antus checked up on the tuning 
of his memory machine with greater celerity 
than he had shown at the beginning of the 
transmission and also checked the watchful 
accuracy indicators. 

The dispassionate voice of trie electron 
translator continued: 

"We 
have received a transmission 
from 
star..." again a long string of figures and stac-
cato sounds, "by chance and not during the 
Great Circle transmission times. They have 
not deciphered the language of the Circle and 
are wasting energy transmitting during the 
hours of silence. We answered them during 
their transmission period and the result will 
be known 
in three-tenths of a second..." 
The voice broke off. The signal lamps conti-
nued to burn with the exception of the green 
electric eye that had gone out. 

"We get these unexplained 
interruptions 
in transmission, perhaps due to the passage 
of the astronauts' legendary neutral fields 
between 
us," 
Junius 
Antus 
explained 
to 
Veda. 

"Three-tenths 
of a galactic 
second—that 
means waiting six hundred years," muttered 
Darr Veter, morosely 
" A lot of good that 
A/ill do us!" 

"As far as I can understand they are in 

communication with Epsilon Tucanae in the 
southern sky that is ninety parsecs away 
from us and close to the limit of our regular 
communications. 
So far we haven't estab-
lished contact with anything farther away 
than Deneb," Mven Mass remarked. 

"But we receive the Galactic Centre and 
the globular clusters, don't we?" asked Veda 
Kong. 

"Irregularly, quite by chance, or through 
the memory machines of other members of 
the Great Circle that form a circuit stretch-
ing through the Galaxy," answered Mven 
Mass. 

"Communications sent out thousands and 
even tens of thousands of years ago do not 
get lost in space but eventually reach us," 
said Junius Antus. 

"So that means we get a picture of the 
life and knowledge of the peoples of other, 
distant worlds, with great delay, for the 
Central Zone of the Galaxy, for example, 
a delay of about twenty thousand years?" 

"Yes, it doesn't matter whether they are 
the 
records of the memory machines of 
other, nearer worlds, or whether they are 
received by our stations, we see the distant 
worlds as they were a very long time ago. 
We see people that have long been dead and 
forgotten in their own worlds." 

"How is it that we are helpless in this 
field when 
we have achieved such great 
power 
over 
nature?" 
Veda 
Kong asked, 
petulantly. "Why can't we find some other 
means of contacting distant worlds, some-

thing not connected with waves or photon 
ray equipment?" 

"How 
well 
I understand 
you, 
Veda!" 
exclaimed Mven Mass. 

"The Academy of the Bounds of Knowledge 
is engaged in projects to overcome space, time 
and gravity," Darr Veter put in. "They are 
working on the fundamentals of the Cosmos, 
but they have not yet got even as far as the 
experimental stage and cannot..." 

The green eye suddenly flashed on again 
and Veda once more felt giddy as the screen 
opened out into endless space. 

The sharply outlined edges of the image 
showed that it was the record of a memory 
machine and not a transmission received di-
rectly. 

At first the onlookers saw the surface of 
a planet, obviously as seen from an outer-
space station, a satellite. The huge, pale violet 
sun, spectral in the terrific heat it generated, 
deluged the cloud envelope of the planet's 
atmosphere with its penetrating rays. 

"Yes, that's it, the luminary of the planet 
is Epsilon Tucanae, a high-temperature star, 
class B 9, 78 times as bright as our Sun," 
whispered Mven Mass. Darr Veter and Junius 
Antus nodded in agreement. 

The spectacle changed, the scene grew 
narrower and seemed to be descending to 
the very soil of the unknown world. 

The rounded domes of hills that looked 
is though they had been cast from bronze 
ose high above the surrounding country. 
An unknown stone or metal glowed like fire 

in the amazingly white light of the blue sun. 
Even in the imperfect apparatus used for 
transmission 
the 
unknown world 
gleamed 
triumphantly, with a sort of victorious mag-
nificence. 

The reflected rays produced a silver pink 
corona around the contours of the copper-
coloured hills and lay in a wide path on the 
slowly moving waves of a violet sea. The 
water, of a deep amethyst colour, seemed 
heavy and glowed from within with red lights 
that looked like an accumulation of living 
eyes. The waves washed the massive pedestal 
of a gigantic statue that stood in splendid 
isolation far from the coast. It was a female 
figure carved from dark-red stone, the head 
thrown back and the arms extended in ecstasy 
towards the flaming depths of the sky. She 
could easily have been a daughter of Earth, 
the resemblance she bore to our people was 
no less astounding than the amazing beauty of 
the carving. Her body was the fulfilment of an 
earthly sculptor's dream; it combined physi-
cal perfection with inspiration in every line. 
The polished red stone of the statue emitted 
the flames of an unknown and, consequently, 
mysterious and attractive life. 

The five people of Earth gazed in silence at 
that astounding new world. The only sound 
was a prolonged sigh that escaped the lips 
of Mven Mass whose every nerve had been 
strained in joyful anticipation from his first 
glance at the statue. 

On 
the 
sea-coast 
opposite 
the 
statue, 
carved silver towers marked the beginning 

of a wide, wh ite staircase that swept boldly 
over a thicket of stately trees with turquoise 
leaves. 

"They ought to ring!" Darr Veter whis-
pered in Veda's ear, pointing to the towers 
and tshe nodded her head in agreement. 

The camera of the new planet continued 
its consistent and soundless journey into the 
country. 

For a second the five people saw white 
walls with wide cornices through which led 
a portal of blue stone; the screen carried them 
into a high room filled with strong light. 
The dull, pearl-coloured, grooved walls lent 
unusual clarity to everything in the hall. 
The 
attention 
of 
the 
Earth-dwellers 
was 
attracted to a group of people standing be-
fore a polished emerald panel. 

The flame-red colour of their skin was 
similar to that of the statue in the sea. It was 
not an unusual colour for Earth—coloured 
photographs that had been preserved from 
ancient days recorded some tribes of Indians 
m Central America whose skin was almost 
the same colour, perhaps just a little lighter. 

There were two men and women in the 
hali. They stood in pairs wearing different 
clothing. The pair standing closer to 
the 
emerald panel wore short golden clothes, 
something like elegant overalls, fastened with 
3 number of clips. The other pair wore cloaks 
fhat covered them from head to foot and 
wre of the same pear1 tone as the walls. 

Those standing before the panel made some 
•^doefui movements, touching some strings 

stretching diagonally from the left-hand edge 
of the panel. The wall of polished emerald 
or glass became transparent and in time with 
the 
movements of the man and woman, 
clearly defined pictures appeared in the crys-
tal. They appeared and disappeared so quick-
ly that even such trained observers as Junius 
Antus 
and 
Darr 
Veter 
had difficulty 
in 
understanding. 

In 
the 
procession 
of 
copper-coloured 
mountains, violet seas and turquoise forests 
the history of the planet emerged. A chain 
of animal and plant forms, sometimes mon-
strously incomprehensible, sometimes beauti-
ful, appeared as ghosts of the past. Many of 
the animals and plants seemed to be similar 
to those that have been preserved in the re-
cord of the rocks on Earth. It was a long 
ladder of ascending forms of life, the ladder 
of developing living matter. The endlessly 
long path of development seemed even longer, 
more difficult and more tortuous than the 
path of evolution known to every Earth-
dweller. 

New pictures flashed through the phantom 
gleam of the apparatus: the flames of huge 
fires, piled-up rocks on the plains, fights 
with savage beasts, the solemn rites of fune-
rals and religious services. The figure of a man 
covered by a cloak of motley-coloured skin 
filled the whole panel. Leaning on a spear 
with one hand and raising the other towards 
the stars in an all-embracing gesture, he stood 
with his foot on the neck of a conquered 
monster with a ridge of stiff hair down its 

back and long, bared fangs. In the background 
a line of men and women had joined hands 
in pairs and seemed to be singing something. 

The picture faded away and the place of 
the tableaux was taken by a dark surface of 
polished stone. 

At this moment the pair in golden clothing 
moved away to the right and their place was 
taken by the second pair. With a movement 
so rapid that the eye could not follow it the 
cloaks were thrown aside and two dark-red 
bodies gleamed like living fire against the 
pearl of the walls. The man held out his 
two hands to the woman and she answered 
him with such a proud and dazzling smile 
of 
joy 
that the 
Earth-dwellers 
responded 
with involuntary smiles. And there, in the 
pearl hall of that immeasurably distant world, 
the two people began a slow dance. It was 
probably not danced for the sake of dancing, 
but was something more in the nature of 
eurhythmies, in which the dancers strove to 
show their perfection, the beauty of the 
lines and the 
agility 
of 
their bodies. A 
majestic and at the same time sorrowful music 
could be felt in the rhythmic change of move-
ment, as though recalling the great ladder 
of countless unnamed victims sacrificed to 
the development of life that had produced 
man, that beautiful and intelligent 
being. 

Mven Mass fancied he could hear a melody, 
a movement in pure high tones played against 
a background of the resonant and measured 
rhythm 
of low notes. Veda Kong squeezed 
Darr Veter's hand but the latter did not pay 

any attention. Junius Antus stood motion-
less watching the scene, without even breath-
ing, and beads of perspiration stood out on 
his broad forehead. 

The people of the Tucanae planet were 
so like the people of Earth that the impres-
sion of another world was gradually 
lost. 
The red people, however, possessed bodies 
of refined beauty such as had not by that 
time 
been 
universally achieved on 
Earth, 
but which lived in the dreams and the crea-
tions of artists and was to be seen only in a 
small number of unusually beautiful people. 

"The more difficult and the longer the 
path of blind animal evolution up to the think-
ing being, the more purposeful and perfect-
ed are the higher forms of life and, therefore, 
the more beautiful," 
thought 
Darr Veter. 
"The people of Earth realized a long time 
ago that beauty is an instinctively compre-
hended purposefulness of structure that is 
adapted 
to 
definite objectives. The 
more 
varied the objectives, the more beautiful the 
form—these red people must be more versa-
tile and agile than we are,.. Perhaps their 
civilization 
has progressed mainly 
through 
the development of man himself, the develop 
ment of 
his spiritual and physical might, 
rather than through technical development, 
Even with the coming of communist society 
our civilization has remained fundamentally 
technical and only in the Era of Common 
Labour did we turn to the perfection of man 
himself and not only ms machines, houses 
food and amusements 

The dance 
was 
over. 
The 
young 
red-
skinned woman came into the centre of the 
hall and the camera of the transmitter focussed 
on her alone. Her outstretched arms and her 
face were turned to the ceiling of the hall. 

The eyes of the Earth-dwellers involun-
tarily followed her glance. There was no ceil-
ing, or, perhaps, some clever optical illusion 
created the impression of a night sky with 
very large and bright stars. The strange com-
binations of constellations did not arouse any 
association. The girl waved her hand and a 
blue ball appeared on the index finger of her 
left hand. A silvery ray streamed out of the 
ball and served her as a gigantic 
pointer 
A round patch of light at the end of the 
oointer halted first on one then on another 
star in the ceiling. In each case the emerald 
panel showed a motionless picture extremely 
wide in scale. As the pointer ray moved from 
star to star the panel demonstrated a series 
of inhabited and uninhabited planets. Joy 
less and sorrowful were the stone or sand 
deserts that burned in the rays of red, blue, 
violet and yellow suns. Sometimes the rays 
of a strange leaden-grey star would 
bring 
to 
life on its planets flattened domes or 
spirals, charged with electricity, that swam 
like jelly-fish in a dense orange atmosphere 
or ocean 
In the world of the red sun there 
grew trees of incredible height with slimy 
black bark, trees that stretched their millions 
if crooked branches heavenwards as though 
•! despair. Other planets were completely 
overed with dark water. Huge living islands 

either 
animal 
or vegetable, were floating 
everywhere, 
their 
countless 
hairy 
feelers 
waving over the smooth surface of the water. 

"They 
have no planets near them that 
possess the higher forms of life," said Junius 
Antus, suddenly, without once taking his 
eyes off the star map of the unknown sky. 

"Yes they have," said Darr Veter, "al-
though the flattened stellar system to one 
side of them is one of the newest formations 
in the Galaxy, we know that flattened and 
globular systems, the old and the new, not 
infrequently alternate. 
In the direction of 
Eridanus there is a system with living intel-
ligences that belongs to the Circle." 

" V V R 4955 + MO 3529... etc.," added 
Mven Mass, "but why don't they know of 
it?" 

"The 
system entered 
the 
Great 
Circle 
275 years ago and this communication was 
made before that," answered Darr 
Veter. 

The 
red-skinned 
girl 
from-the 
distant 
world shook the blue ball from her finger and 
turned to face her audience, her arms spread 
out widely as though to embrace some in-
visible person standing before her. She threw 
back her head and shoulders as a woman of 
Earth would in a burst of passion. Her mouth 
was half open and her lips moved as she 
repeated 
inaudible 
words. 
So she stood, 
immobile, appealing, sending forth into the 
cold 
darkness 
of 
interstellar 
space fiery 
human words of an entreaty for friendship 
with people of other worlds. 

Again 
her enthralling 
beauty 
held 
the 

Earth-dwellers spellbound. She had nothing 
of the bronze severity of the red-skinned 
people of Earth. Her round face, small nose 
and big, widely-placed blue 
eyes bore more 
resemblance to the northern peoples of Earth. 
Her thick, wavy black hair was not stiff. 
Every line of her face and body expressed a 
light and joyful confidence that came from a 
subconscious feeling of great strength. 

"Is it possible that they know nothing 
of the Great Circle?" 
Veda Kong almost 
groaned as though in obeisance before her 
beautiful sister from the Cosmos. 

"By now they probably know," answered 
Darr Veter, "the scenes we have witnessed 
date three hundred years back." 

"Eighty-eight 
parsecs," 
rumbled 
Mven 
Mass's low voice. "Eighty-eight... All those 
people we have just seen have long been dead." 

As though in confirmation of his words 
the scene from the wonderful world disap-
peared and the green indicator went out. 
The transmission around the Great Circle was 
over. 

For another minute they were all in a 
trance. The first to recover was Darr Veter. 
Biting his lip in chagrin he hurriedly turned 
the garnet lever. The column of directed 
energy switched off with the sound of a gong 
that warned power-station engineers to re-
direct the gigantic stream of energy into its 
usual channels. The Director of the Outer 
Stations 
turned 
back 
to 
his 
companions 
only when all the necessary manipulations 
had been completed. 

Junius Antus, with a frown on his face, 
was looking through pages of written notes. 

"Some 
of 
the 
memory 
records 
taken 
down from the stellar map on the ceiling must 
be sent to the Southern Sky Institute!" he 
said, turning to Darr Veter's young assistant. 
The latter looked at Junius Antus in amaze-
ment as though he had just awakened from 
an unusual dream. 

The grim scientist looked at him, a smile 
lurking in his eyes—what they had seen was 
indeed a dream of a wonderful world sent 
out into space three hundred years before ... a 
dream that thousands of millions of people 
on Earth and in the colonies on the Moon, 
Mars and Venus would now see so clearly 
that it would be almost tangible. 

"You 
were 
right, 
Mven 
Mass," 
smiled 
Darr Veter, "when you said before the trans-
mission began that something unusual was 
going to happen today. For the first time in 
the eight hundred years since we joined the 
Great Circle a planet has appeared in the Uni-
verse inhabited by beings who are our brothers 
not only in intellect but in body as well. 
You can well imagine my joy at this discov-
ery. Your tour of duty as Director has begun 
auspiciously! In the old days people would 
have said that it was a lucky sign and our 
present-day 
psychologists 
would 
say 
that 
coincidental events have occurred that favour 
confidence and give you encouragement in 
your further work." 

Darr 
Veter 
stopped 
suddenly: 
nervous 
reaction had made him more verbose than 

usual. In the Era of the Great Circle verbosity 
was considered one of the most disgraceful 
'ailings possible in a man—the Director of the 
Outer Stations stopped without finishing his 
sentence. 

"Yes, yes..." responded Mven Mass, ab-
sent-mindedly. 

Junius Antus noticed the sluggishness in 
his voice and in his movements; he was 
immediately on the alert. Veda Kong quietly 
ran her finger along Darr Veter's hand and 
nodded towards the African. 

"Perhaps he is too impressionable?" won-
dered Darr Veter staring fixedly at his succes-
sor. Mven Mass sensed the concealed surprise 
of his companions; he straightened up and be-
came his usual self, an attentive and skilled 
performer of the task in hand. An escalator 
cook them to the upper storeys of the build-
ing where there were extensive views of the 
starry sk^ that was again as far away as it had 
always been during the whole thirty thous-
and years of man's existence—or rather the 
existence of that species of hominids known 
as Homo 
sapiens. 

Mven Mass and Darr Veter had to remain 
behind. 

Veda Kong whispered to Darr Veter that 
-she would never forget that night. 

It made me feel so insignificant!" she 
said in conclusion, her face beaming despite 
her sorrowful words. Darr Veter knew what 
she meant and shook his head 

I am sure that i f the red woman had 
seen you she would havr been proud of her 

sister, Veda. Surely our Earth isn't a bit worse 
than their planet!" Darr Veter's face was 
glowing with the light of love. 

"That's 
seen 
through 
your 
eyes, 
my 
friend," smiled Veda, "but ask Mven Mass 
what he thinks!" Jokingly she covered his 
eyes with 
her hand and then disappeared 
round a corner of the wall. 

When Mven Mass was, at last, left alone 
it was already morning. A greyish light was 
breaking through the cool, still air and the sky 
and the sea were alike in the crystal transpa-
rency, the sea silver and the sky pinkish. 

For a long time Mven Mass stood on the 
balcony of the observatory gazing at the 
still 
unfamiliar 
outlines 
of 
the 
buildings. 

On a low plateau in the distance rose a 
huge aluminium arch crossed by nine paral-
lel aluminium bars, the spaces between them 
filled in with yellowish-cream and silvery 
plastic glass; this was the building of the As-
tronautical Council. Before the building stood 
a monument to the first people to enter outer 
space; the steep slope of a mountain reaching 
into clouds and whirlwinds was surmounted 
by an old-type spaceship, a fish-shaped rocket 
that pointed its sharp nose into still unattain-
able heights. Cast-metal figures, supporting 
each other in a chain, were making a super-
human effort to climb upwards, spiralling 
their way around the base of the monument— 
these were the pilots of the spaceships, the 
physicists, astronomers, biologists and writers 
with bold imaginations... The hull of the old 
spaceship and the light lattice-work of the 

Council building were painted red by the 
dawn, but still Mven Mass continued pacing 
up and down the balcony. Never before had 
he met with such a shock. He had been 
brought up according to the general educa-
tional rules of the Great Circle Era, had had a 
hard physical training and had successfully 
performed his Labours of Hercules—the diffi-
cult task performed by every young person at 
the end of his schooling that had been given 
this name in honour of ancient Greece. If a 
youngster 
performed 
these tasks success-
fully he was considered worthy to storm the 
heights of higher education. 

Mven Mass had worked on the construc-
tion of the water-supply system of a mine in 
Western Tibet, on the restoration of the Arau-
caria pine forests on the Nahebt Plateau in 
South America and had taken part in the 
annihilation of the sharks that had again ap-
peared off the coasts of Australia. His train-
ing, his heredity and his outstanding abilities 
enabled him to undertake many years of 
persistent study to prepare himself for diffi-
cult and responsible activities. On that day, 
during the first hour of his new work, there 
had been a meeting with a world that was 
related to Earth and that had brought some-
thing new to his heart. With alarm Mven Mass 
felt that some great depths had opened up 
within him, something whose existence he 
had never even suspected. How he craved for 
another 
meeting with 
the planet of star 
Epsilon in the Tucanae Constellation'. 
That 
was a world that seemed to have come into 

being by power of the best legends known to 
the Earth-dwellers. He would never forget the 
red-skinned girl, her outstretched alluring 
arms, her tender, half-open lips! 

The fact that two hundred and ninety 
light years dividing him from that marvellous 
world was a distance that could not be cover-
ed by any means known to the technicians 
of 
Earth served to strengthen rather than 
weaken his dream. 

Something new had grown up in Mven's 
heart, something that lived its own life and 
did not submit to the control of the will 
and cold intellect. The African had never been 
in love, he had been absorbed in his work al-
most as a hermit would be and had never 
experienced anything 
like 
the alarm and 
incomparable joy that had entered his heart 
during that meeting across the tremendous 
barrier of space and time. 

Chapter Three 

CAPTIVES OF THE D A R K 

The fat black arrows on the orange-coloured 
anameson 
fuel 
indicators 
stood at 
zero. 
The spaceship had not escaped the iron star, 
its speed was still great and it was being drawn 
towards that horrible star that human eyes 
ould not see. 

The astronavigator helped Erg Noor, who 
was trembling from weakness and from the 
effort he had made, to sit down at the com-
puter. The planetary motors, disconnected 
"rom the robot helmsman, faded out. 

"Ingrid, what's an iron star?" asked Kay 
Bear, softly; all that time he had been stand-
ing motionless behind her back. 

"An invisible star spectral class T, that has 
)ecome extinguished and is either in the pro 
:ess of cooling off or of reheating. It emana 

tes the long infra-red waves of the heat end 
of the spectrum whose rays are black to us 
and can only be seen through the electronic 
inverter. An owl can see the infra-red rays 
and, therefore, could see the star." 

"Why is it called iron?" 
"There is a lot of iron in the spectrum of 
those that have been studied and it seems 
there's a lot of it in the star's composition. If 
the star is a big one its mass and gravity are 
enormous. And I'm afraid we're going to meet 
one of the big ones." 

"What comes next?" 
" I don't know. You know yourself that 
we've 
got 
no 
fuel. 
We're flying 
straight 
towards the star. We must brake Tantra down 
to a speed one-thousandth of the absolute, at 
which speed sufficient angular deviation will 
be possible. If the planetary fuel gives out 
too, the spaceship will slowly approach the 
star until it falls on it." 

Ingrid jerked her head nervously and Kay 
gently 
stroked her bare arm, ail covered 
with goose-flesh. 

The commander of the expedition went 
over to the control desk and concentrated 
on the instruments. Everybody kept silent, 
almost afraid to breathe, even Nisa Creet, 
who, although she had only just woke up, 
realized instinctively the danger of their sit-
uation. The fuel might be sufficient to brake 
the ship; but with loss of velocity it would be 
more difficult to get out of the tremen-
dous gravitational 
field 
of 
the 
iron 
star 
without 
the ship's 
motors. 
If Tantra 
had 
not 

approached so close and if Lynn had rea-
lized in time ... but what consolation was 
there in those empty "ifs"? 

Three hours passed before Erg Noor had 
made his decision. Tantra vibrated from the 
powerful thrust of the trigger motors. Her 
speed was reduced. An hour, a second, a 
third 
and a fourth, a barely 
perceptible 
movement of the commander's hand, horrible 
nausea for everybody in the ship and the 
terrifying brown star disappeared from the 
forward screen and reappeared on the second. 
Invisible bonds of gravity continued to hold 
the ship and were recorded in the measuring 
instruments. Two red eyes burned over Erg 
Noor's head. He pulled a lever towards him-
self and the motors stopped working. 

"We're out!" breathed Pel Lynn in relief. 
The commander slowly turned his glance 
towards him. 

"We're not. We have only the iron ration of 
fuel left, sufficient for orbital revolution and 
landing." 

"What can we do?" 
"Wait! 
I have diverted the ship a little, 
but we are passing too close. A battle is now 
going on between the star's force of gravity 
and the reduced speed of Tantra. It's flying 
like a lunar rocket at the moment and if it 
can get away we shall fly towards the Sun 
and will be able to call Earth. The time re-
quired for the journey, of course, will be 
much greater. 
In about thirty years we'll 
send out our call for help and another eight 
years later it will come." 

"Thirty-eight years!" 
Bear whispered in 
scarcely audible tones in Ingrid's ear. She 
pulled him sharply by the sleeve and turned 
away. 

Erg Noor leaned back in his chair and 
dropped his hands on his knees. Nobody 
spoke and the instruments continued softly 
humming. Another melody, out of tune and, 
therefore, ominous, was added to the tuned 
melody of the navigation instruments. The 
call of the iron star, the great strength of its 
iron mass reaching out for the weakened 
spaceship, was almost physically 
tangible. 

Nisa Creet's cheeks were burning, her heart 
was beating wildly. This inactive waiting had 
become unbearable. 

The hours dragged by. One after another 
the awakened members of the expedition 
appeared in the control tower. The number 
of silent people increased until all fourteen 
were assembled, 

The speed of the ship had been progres-
sively reduced until it reached a point that 
was lower than the velocity of escape so that 
Tantra could not get away from the iron star. 
Her crew forgot all about food and sleep and 
did not leave the control tower for many 
miserable 
hours 
during which 
the 
ship's 
course changed more and more to a curve 
until she was in the fatal elliptical orbit. 
Tantra's fate was obvious to the entire crew. 

A sudden howl made them all start. Astro-
nomer Pour Hyss jumped up and waved his 
hands. His distorted face was unrecogni?able, 
he bore no resemblance to a man of the 

Great Circle Era. Fear, self-pity and a craving 
for revenge had swept all signs of mental 
activity from the face of the scientist. 

"Him, 
it was him," howled Pour Hyss, 
pointing to Pel Lynn, "that clot, that fool, 
that 
brainless 
worm!.." 
The 
astronomer 
choked as he tried to recall the swear-words 
of his ancestors that had long before gone out 
of use. Nisa, who was standing near him, 
moved away contemptuously. Erg Noor stood 
up. 

"The condemnation of a colleague will not 
help us. The time is past when such an action 
could have been intentional. In this case," 
Noor spun the handles on the computing 
machine carelessly, "as you see there was a 
thirty per cent probability of error. If we add 
to that the inevitable depression that comes 
at the end of a tour of duty and the distur-
bance due to the pitching of the ship I don't 
doubt that you, Pour Hyss, would have made 
the same mistake!" 

"And you?" shouted the astronomer, but 
with less fury than before. 

" I should not. I saw a monster like this at 
close quarters during the 36th Space Expedi-
tion. It is mostly my fault—I hoped to pilot 
the ship through the unknown region myself, 
but I did not foresee everything, I confined 
myself to giving simple instructions!" 

"How could you have known that they 
would enter this region without you?" ex-
claimed Nisa. 

"I should have known it," answered Erg 
Noor, firmly, in this way refusing the friendly 

aid of the astronavigator, "but there's no 
sense in talking about it until we get back to 
Earth." 

"To Earth!" whined Pour Hyss and even 
Pel Lynn frowned in perplexity. "To say 
that, when all is lost and only death lies 
ahead of us!" 

"Not 
death but a gigantic struggle lies 
ahead of us," answered Erg Noor, confident-
ly, sitting down in a chair that stood before 
the table. "Sit down. There's no need to 
hurry until Tantra has made one and a half 
revolutions." 

Those present obeyed him in silence and 
Nisa gave the biologist a smile, triumphant, 
despite the 
hopelessness of the 
moment. 

"This 
star 
undoubtedly 
has a planet, 
even two, I imagine, judging by the curves 
of the isograves.10 The planets, as you see," 
the commander made a rapid but accurate 
sketch, "should be big ones and, therefore, 
should have an atmosphere. We don't need to 
land, though, we have enough atomized solid 
oxygen."1 T Erg Noor stopped to gather his 
thoughts. "We shall become the satellite of 
the planet and travel in orbit around it. If 
the atmosphere of the planet is suitable and 
we use up our air, we have sufficient plane-
tary fuel to land and call for help. In six 
months we can calculate the direction," he 
continued, "transmit to 
Earth the results 
obtained from Zirda, send for a rescue ship, 
and save our ship." 

"If we do save it..." Pour Hyss pulled a 
w r y 
face as he tried to hide the joy that 

kindled anew in his heart. 

"Yes, if we do," agreed Erg Noor. "That, 
however, is clearly our goal. We must muster 
all our forces to achieve it. You, Pour Hyss 
and Ingrid Dietra, make your observations 
and calculate the size of the planets. Bear and 
Nisa, compute the velocity from the mass 
of the planets and when you know that 
compute the orbital velocity of the spaceship 
and the optimal radiant12 for its revolutions." 

The explorers began to make preparations 
for a landing should it prove to be necessary. 
The biologist, the geologist and the physician 
prepared a reconnaissance robot, the mecha-
nics adjusted the landing locators and search-
lights and got ready a rocket satellite that 
would transmit a message to Earth. 

The work went particularly well after the 
horror 
and hopelessness they had experi-
enced and was only 
interrupted 
by 
the 
pitching of the ship in gravitational vortices. 
Tantra, however, had so reduced her speed 
that the pitching no longer caused the people 
great discomfort. 

Pour Hyss and Ingrid established the pres-
ence of two planets. They had to reject the 
idea of approaching the outer planet—it was 
huge in size, cold, encircled by a thick layer 
of atmosphere that was probably poisonous 
and threatened them with death. If they had 
to make a choice of deaths it would prob-
ably have been better to burn up on the 
surface of the iron star than drown in the 
gloom of an ammonia atmosphere by plung-
ing the ship into a thousand-kilometre thick 

layer of ammonia ice. There were similar 
terrible, gigantic 
planets in the solar sys-
tem—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. 

Tantra 
continued to approach the star. 
In nineteen days they determined the size of 
the inner planet and it proved to be bigger 
than Earth. The planet was quite close to its 
sun, the iron star, and was carried round its 
orbit at frantic speed, its year being no more 
than two or three terrestrial months. The 
invisible star T no doubt made it quite warm 
with its black rays and, if there was an atmos-
phere, life could have emerged there. In the 
latter case landing would 
be particularly 
dangerous. 

Alien forms of life that had developed 
under conditions of other planets and by 
other evolutionary paths and had the albu-
min cells common to the whole Cosmos 
were extremely dangerous to Earth-dwellers. 
The adaptation of the organism to protect 
itself 
against 
harmful 
refuse and disease 
bacteria that had been going on for millions 
of centuries on our planet was powerless 
against alien forms of life. To the same degree 
life from other planets was in similar danger 
on Earth. 

The basic activity of animal life—in killing 
to devour and in devouring to kill—made its 
appearance with depressingly brutal cruelty 
when the animal life of different 
worlds 
clashed. Fantastic diseases, instantaneous epi 
demies, the terrible spreading of pests and 
horrible injuries beset the first explorations 
of habitable but uninhabited planets Worlds 

that were inhabited by intelligent beings made 
numerous experiments and preparations be-
fore establishing direct spaceship communica-
tions. On our Earth, far removed from the 
central 
parts 
of 
the 
Galaxy 
where 
life 
abounds, there had been no visitors from the 
planets of other stars, no representatives of 
other civilizations. The Astronautical Council 
had shortly before completed 
preparations 
for the reception of visitors from the planets 
of not too distant stars in the Ophiuchus, 
Cygnus, Ursa Major and Apus constellations. 

Erg Noor, worried by the possibility of 
meeting with unknown forms of life, ordered 
the biological means of defence, that he had 
taken a big supply of in the hope of visiting 
Vega, to be brought out of the distant store 
rooms. 

At last Tantra equalized her orbital velo-
city with that of the planet and then began 
to revolve around it. The indefinite, dark-
brown surface of the planet, or rather, of its 
atmosphere, with reflections of the bloody-
brown sun, could only be seen through the 
electronic inverter. All members of the expe-
dition were busy at the instruments. 

"The temperature of the upper layers of 
the 
daylight side is 320° 
on the 
Kelvin 

scale. 

"Rotation about the axis approximately 
20 days." 

"The locators show the presence of water 
and land." 

"The 
thickness 
of 
the 
atmosphere 
is 
1,700 kilometres." 

"The exact mass is 43.2 times Earth's 
mass." 

The reports followed one another contin-
uously and the nature of the planet was 
becoming clearer. 

Erg Noor summarized the figures as they 
came in and was making preparations to com-
pute the orbit. The planet was a big one, 
43.2 times the mass of Earth, and its force 
of gravity would hold the ship pressed down 
to the ground. The people would be as help-
less as flies on a fly-paper. 

The commander recalled the terrible sto-
ries he had heard, half-legend, half-history, 
of the old spaceships that had, for various 
reasons, come into contact with the huge 
planets. In those days the slow ships with 
low-powered fuel often perished. The end 
came with a roar of motors and the spasmo-
dic shuddering of a ship that could not get 
away but remained stuck to the surface of the 
planet. The ship remained intact but the 
bones of the people trying to crawl about the 
ship were broken. The indescribable horror 
of great weight had been communicated in 
the fragmentary cries of last reports, in the 
farewell transmissions. 

The crew of Tantra were not menaced by 
that danger as long as they revolved about the 
planet. If they had to land on its surface, 
however, only the strongest people would be 
able to drag the weight of their own bodies 
in this, the future haven that was to be 
theirs for many long years... Could they keep 
alive under such conditions—crushed by the 

great weight, in the eternal darkness of the 
infra-red rays of the black sun, in a dense 
atmosphere? 

Whatever the conditions were, it was a 
hope of salvation, it did not mean death and, 
anyway, there was no choice! 

Tantra's 
orbit drew closer to the outer 
fringe of the atmosphere. The expedition 
could not miss the opportunity of investi-
gating a hitherto unknown planet that was 
comparatively close to Earth. The lighted, 
or rather, heated side of the planet differed 
from the night side not only by its much 
greater temperature but also by the huge 
accumulations of electricity that so inter-
fered with the powerful locators that their in-
dications were distorted beyond recognition. 
Erg Noor decided to study the planet with 
the help of bomb stations. They sent out a 
physical research robot and the automatic 
recorder reported on an astonishing quantity 
of free oxygen in an atmosphere of neon and 
nitrogen, the presence of water vapour and 
a temperature of +12°C. These were condi-
tions that, in general, were similar to those 
on Earth. But the pressure of the thick at-
mosphere was 1.4 times that of normal pres-
sure of Earth and the force of gravity was 
2.5 times greater. 

"We can live here," said the biologist, 
smiling feebly as he reported the station's 
findings to the commander. 

"If we can live on that gloomy, heavy 
planet, 
then something is probably 
living 
there already, something small and harmful." 

For the spaceship's fifteenth revolution a 
bomb station with a powerful transmitter 
was prepared. This second physical research 
robot, dropped on the night side when the 
planet had rotated through 120°, disappeared 
without sending out any signals. 

" I t has fallen into the ocean," said geolo-
gist Beena Ledd, biting her lips in annoyance. 

"We must feel our way with the main lo-
cator before we put out a TV robot. We've 
only got two of them." 

Tantra emitted a bunch of directed radio 
waves as she revolved round the planet, feel-
ing for the contours of seas and continents 
that owing to distortion were unclear. They 
found the outlines of a huge plain that thrust 
out into the ocean, or divided two oceans, 
almost on the planet's equator. The spaceship's 
ray zigzagged across a strip of land two hun-
dred kilometres wide. Suddenly a bright point 
flared up on the locator screen. A whistle 
that lashed their strained nerves told them 
that it was no hallucination. 

"Metal!" 
exclaimed the geologist. 
" A n 
open deposit." 
Erg Noor shook his head. 

"Although 
the flash did not last long 
I managed to note its regular outline. That 
was a huge piece of metal, a meteorite or..." 

" A ship!" exclaimed Nisa and the biologist 
together. 

"Fantasy!" snapped Pour Hyss. 
" I t 
may be fact," objected Erg Noor. 

"What does it matter, it's no use arguing," said 
Pour Hyss, unwilling to give in. 'There's no way 
of proving it, we're not going to land, are we?" 

"We'll check up on it in three hours' time 
when we 
reach that 
plain 
again. 
Notice 
that the metal object is on the plain that I, 
too, would have chosen to land on. We'll 
throw out the TV robot at that very spot. 
Tune the locator ray to a six-second warn-
ing!" 

The 
commander's 
plan 
was 
successful 
and Tantra 
made another three-hour flight 
round the dark planet. The next time the 
ship approached the continental 
plain 
it 
was met by TV broadcasts from the robot. 
The people peered into the light screen. With 
a click the visible ray was switched on and 
peered like a human eye, noting the outlines 
of things far down below, in that thousand-
kilometre-deep black abyss. Kay Bear could 
well imagine the head of the robot station 
sticking out of the armour plate and re-
volving 
like 
a lighthouse. The zone that 
was swept by the instrument's eye appeared 
on the screen and was there and then photo-
graphed: the view consisted of low cliffs, hills 
and the winding black lines of watercourses. 
Suddenly 
the vision 
of 
a gleaming fish-
shaped object crossed the screen and again 
melted into the darkness as it was abandoned 
by the light ray to the darkness and the 
ledges of the plateau. 

" A 
spaceship!" gasped several voices in 
unison. Nisa looked at Pour Hyss with undis-
guised triumph. The screen went dark as 
Tantra left the area of the TV robot's activity 
and Eon Thai immediately set about develop-
ing the film of the electronic photographs. 

With fingers that trembled with impatience 
he placed the film in the projector of the 
hemispherical screen that would give them 
stereoscopic pictures of what had been pho-
tographed. The inner walls of the hollow 
hemisphere gave them an enlarged picture. 

The familiar cigar-shaped outlines of the 
ship's bows, the bulge of the stern, the high 
ridge of the equilibrium receiver... No matter 
how unbelievable it all was, no matter how 
utterly impossible they might regard a meet-
ing here, on the dark planet, the robot could 
not invent anything, a terrestrial spaceship 
lay there! It lay horizontally, in the normal 
landing position, supported by its powerful 
landing struts, undamaged, as though it had 
only just alighted on to the planet of the iron 
star. 

Tantra, revolving in a shorter orbit closer 
to the planet, sent out signals that were not 
answered. A few more hours passed. The 
fourteen members of the expedition again 
gathered in the control tower. Erg Noor, who 
had 
been sitting in deep 
contemplation, 
stood up. 

" I propose to land Tantra. Perhaps our 
brothers are in need of help, perhaps their 
ship is damaged and cannot return to Earth. 
If so we can take them, transfer their ana-
meson and save ourselves. There is no sense in 
sending out a rescue rocket. It cannot do 
anything to give us fuel and will use up so 
much energy that there will not be enough 
left to send a signal to Earth." 

"Suppose the ship is here because of a 

shortage of 
anameson?" asked Pel 
Lynn, 
cautiously. 

"Then it should have ion planetary charges, 
they could not have used up everything. 
As you see the spaceship is in its proper 
position which means they landed with the 
planetary motors. We'll transfer the ion fuel, 
take off again and go into orbit; then we can 
call Earth for help and in case of success 
that won't take more than eight years. And if 
we can get anameson, then we shall have won 
out." 

"Maybe they have photon and not ion 
charges for 
their planetary motors," said 
one of the engineers. 

"We can make use of them in the big mo-
tors if we fit them with auxiliary bowl reflec-
tors." 

"I see you've thought of everything," said 
the engineer, giving in. 

"There is still the risk of landing on a heavy 
planet and the risk of living there," muttered 
Pour Hyss. "It's awful just to think of that 
world of darkness!" 

"The risk, of course, remains. But there is 
risk in our very situation and we shall hardly 
increase it by landing. The planet on which 
our spaceship will land is not a bad one as 
long as we do not damage the ship." 

Erg Noor cast a glance at the dial of the 
speed regulator and walked swiftly to the 
control desk. For a whole minute he stood 
in front of the levers and vernier scales of 
the controls. The fingers of his big hands 
moved as though they were selecting chords 

on some musical instrument, his back was 
bent and his face turned to stone. 

Nisa Creet went up to him, boldly took his 
right 
hand and pressed the palm to 
her 
smooth cheek, hot from excitement. 
Erg 
Noor nodded in gratitude, stroked the girl's 
mass of hair and straightened himself up. 

"We are entering the 
lower 
layers 
of 
the atmosphere to land," he said loudly, 
switching on the warning siren. The howl 
carried throughout the ship and the crew 
hurried to strap themselves into hydraulic 
floating seats. 

Erg Noor dropped into the soft embrace 
of the landing chair that rose up from the 
floor before the control desk. Then came the 
heavy strokes of the planetary engines and the 
spaceship 
rushed down, 
howling, towards 
the cliffs and oceans of the unknown planet. 

The locators and the infra-red reflectors 
felt their way through the primordial dark-
ness below, red lights glowed on the altimeter 
scales at 15,000 metres. It was not anticipat-
ed that there would be mountains much 
over 10,000 metres high on the planet where 
water and the heat of the black sun had been 
working to level out the surface just as they 
do on Earth. 

The first revolution round the planet re-
vealed 
no 
mountains, 
only 
insignificant 
heights, little bigger than those on Mars. It 
looked as though the activity of the internal 
forces that gave rise to mountains had ceased 
or had been checked. 

Erg Noor placed the altitude governor at 

2,000 metres and switched on the power-
ful searchlights. A huge ocean stretched below 
the spaceship, an ocean of horror, an un-
broken mass of black waves that rose and 
fell over unfathomable depths. 

The biologist wiped away the perspira-
tion caused by his strenuous efforts; he was 
trying to catch in his instrument the faint 
variations in reflection from the black water 
to determine its salt and mineral content. 

The 
gleaming black of the water gave 
way to the dull black of land. The crossed 
rays of the searchlights cut a narrow lane 
between walls of 
darkness. 
Unexpectedly 
there were patches of colour in this lane, 
yellow sands and the greyish-green surface 
of a flat rocky ridge. 

Tantra 
swept 
across 
the 
continent, 
obedient to the skilled hand of the comman-
der. 

At last Erg Noor found the plain he was 
looking for; it proved to be low-lying country 
that could not possibly be termed a plateau 
although it was obvious that the tides and 
storms of the black sea would not reach it, 
lying, as it did, some hundred metres above 
the surrounding country. 

The locator on the spaceship's port bow 
whistled. Tantra's 
searchlights followed the 
locator beam and the clear outlines of a first-
class spaceship came into view. The bow 
armour, made of an isotope of iridium having 
a reorganized crystalline structure, shone like 
new in the rays of the searchlight. There 
were no temporary structures anywhere near 

the ship, there were no lights on board—it 
stood dark and lifeless and did not in any way 
react to the approach of a sister ship. The 
searchlight rays moved past the ship and were 
reflected from a huge disc with spiral projec-
tions as they would have been from a blue 
mirror. The disc was standing on edge, leaning 
slightly to one side and was partly buried in 
the black soil. For a moment the observers 
got the impression that there were cliffs 
behind the disc and that beyond them the 
darkness was blacker and thicker, probably 
it was a precipice or a slope leading down to 
the lowlands... 

The deafening roar of Tantra'% sirens shook 
the hull of the ship. Erg Noor intended to 
land close to the newly-discovered ship and 
was giving warning to any people who might 
be within the danger zone, that is, within a 
radius of some thousand metres from the 
landing place. The terrific roar of the plane-
tary motors could be heard even inside the 
ship and a cloud of red-hot dust appeared 
in the screens. The ship's floor began to rise 
up and then slip backwards. The hydraulic 
hinges of 
the 
landing seats turned them 
smoothly 
and 
soundlessly, 
keeping 
them 
perpendicular to the now vertical floors. 

The huge jointed landing struts slid out of 
the ship's hull, straightened out and took the 
first shock of the landing on an alien world. 
A shock, a recoil and another shock and 
Tantra, 
her bows still swaying, came to a 
standstill at the same time as the engines cut 
out. Erg Noor raised his hand to a lever on 

the control desk that was now directly over 
his head and released the jointed struts. 
Slowly, with a number of short jerks, the 
spaceship's bows sank towards the ground 
until the hull had assumed its normal, hori-
zontal position. The landing had been ac-
complished. As usual, the landing had shaken 
the human organism so strongly that the 
astronauts required some time to 
recover 
and remained semi-recumbent in their landing 
seats. 

They were all held down by an awful 
weight and were scarcely able to rise to their 
feet, like patients recovering slowly from a 
serious illness. The 
irrepressible 
biologist, 
however, had managed to take a sample of 
the air. 

"It's fit to breathe," he said. "I'll take a 
look at it through the microscope." 

"Don't bother," said Erg Noor, unfasten-
ing the cushions of his landing chair, "we 
can't go out without a spacesuit. There may 
be very dangerous spores and viruses on this 
planet." 

In the air-lock at the exit to the ship 
biologically shielded spacesuits and "jumping 
skeletons" had been prepared in readiness 
for 
an 
exploring 
party: 
the 
"skeletons" 
were steel, leather-covered frames that were 
worn over the spacesuits and were fitted 
with 
electric 
motors, 
springs 
and 
shock 
absorbers to enable the explorers to move 
about under conditions of excessive weight. 

After six years travelling through interstel-
lar space every one of them wanted to feel 

soil, even alien soil, under his feet. Kay Bear, 
Pour Hyss, Ingrid, Doctor Louma Lasvy and 
two engineers had to remain on board the 
vessel to man the radio, searchlights and 
various measuring and recording instruments. 

Nisa stood aside from the party with her 
space helmet in her hands. 

"Why do you hesitate, Nisa?" the comman-
der called to her as he tested the radio set in 
the top of his helmet. "Come along to the 
spaceship!" 

"I... I..." the girl stammered, "I believe it's 
dead, it's been standing here a long time... 
Another catastrophe, another victim claimed 
by 
the 
merciless 
Cosmos. 
I 
know 
it's 
inevitable but still it's hard to bear, especially 
after Zirda and A/grab..." 

"Perhaps the death of this spaceship will 
mean life for us," said Pour Hyss who was 
busy training a short-focus telescope on the 
other ship which still remained unlighted. 

Eight members of the expedition climbed 
into the air-lock and waited. 

"Turn 
on the air!" ordered 
Erg Noor 
addressing those who were remaining on the 
ship and from whom they were now divided 
by an air-tight wall. 

When the pressure in the air-lock had risen 
to ten atmospheres and was higher than that 
outside, hydraulic jacks opened the hermeti-
cally sealed doors. The air pressure in the 
lock was so great that it almost hurled the 
people out of the chamber and at the same 
time prevented anything harmful in the alien 
atmosphere from entering the chamber. The 

door clanged to behind them. The rays of a 
searchlight lit up a clear road along which 
the explorers hobbled on their spring legs, 
scarcely able to drag their own heavy weight 
along. The gigantic spaceship stood at the 
other end of the beam of light, about a mile 
away, a distance that seemed interminable to 
them in their impatience. They were badly 
shaken up by their clumsy jumps over uneven 
ground covered with small boulders and great-
ly heated by the black sun. 

The stars made pale, diffused patches when 
seen through the dense, highly humid at-
mosphere. Instead of the brilliant magnifi-
cence of the Cosmos the planet's sky showed 
only a faint suggestion of the constellations, 
the pale, reddish lanterns of their stars unable 
to 
penetrate the darkness on the 
planet. 

The spaceship stood out in clear relief in 
the profound darkness of its surroundings. 
The thick borated zirconium lacquer on the 
hull plates had been rubbed off in places. 
The ship must have been wandering about the 
Cosmos for a long time. 

An exclamation, repeated in all the ear-
phones, came from Eon Thai. With his hand 
he pointed to the ship's smaller lift that had 
been lowered to the ground and stood with its 
door wide open. What were 
undoubtedly 
plants grew around the lift and under the 
ship's hull. Thick stems raised black bowls 
of parabolic shape nearly three feet above the 
j round; they had serrated edges, something 
'ike the teeth of a cogwheel, and it was diffi-
cult 
to say whether they 
were leaves or 

flowers. A mass of these motionless cog-
wheels growing together had a sinister look 
about them. Still more disturbing was the 
silent, open door of the lift. Untouched plants 
and an open door could only mean that no-
body had used that way for a long time, that 
the 
people 
were 
not guarding their 
tiny 
terrestrial world from that which was alien 
to them. 

Erg Noor, Eon Thai and Nisa Creet entered 
the lift and the commander pressed the but-
ton. With a squeak the machinery was set in 
motion and the lift carried the explorers 
to the wide-open air-lock. They were fol-
lowed by the others. Erg Noor transmitted an 
order to switch off the searchlight on Tantra. 
An instant later the tiny group of Earth-dwel-
lers was lost in utter darkness. The world of 
the iron sun enveloped them as though try-
ing to absorb that feeble spark of terrest-
rial life pressed down to the soil of the huge 
black planet. 

They switched on the revolving electric 
lanterns in their helmets. The inner door of 
the air-lock, leading into the ship, was closed 
but not locked, and opened at a push. The 
explorers entered the central corridor and 
easily found their way through the dark 
alleyways. The spaceship differed but little 
from Tantra in its design. 

"This ship was built less than a hundred 
years ago," said Erg Noor, drawing closer to 
Nisa. The girl looked round. Through the si 1 -
icolloid14 helmet 
the 
commander's 
half-
lighted face looked mysterious. 

" A n impossible idea," he continued, "but 
suppose this is..." 

"ParusV 
exclaimed Nisa. She had forgotten 
the 
microphone 
and saw everybody 
turn 
towards her. 

The explorers made their way to the chief 
room of the spaceship, the combined library 
and laboratory, and from there continued 
towards the ship's control tower in the bows. 
Staggering along in his "skeleton", swaying 
from side to side and banging against the walls 
as he went, the commander reached the main 
switchboard. The ship's lights were switched 
on but there was no current to keep them 
going. The phosphorescent signs and indica-
tors still glowed in the darkness. Erg Noor 
found the emergency switch, pressed it and, 
to their surprise, the lamps glowed dimly, 
but to the explorers they seemed blindingly 
bright. The light in the lift must have gone 
on, too, for they heard the voice of Pour 
Hyss in their earphones, asking about the 
results of the examination. Geologist Beena 
Ledd answered him as the commander had 
suddenly stopped in the doorway of the con-
trol tower. Following his glance Nisa looked 
up and saw, between the forward screens, a 
double inscription, in the letters of 
Earth 
and the symbols of the Great Circle—Parus. 
A line drawn under the word separated it 
from Earth's galactic call-sign and the coor-
dinates of the Solar System. 

The spaceship that had disappeared eighty 
years before had been found in the system of 
the black sun, a system that had formerly 

been unknown and had been regarded as a 
dark cloud. 

An examination of the interior of the 
spaceship did not tell them what had hap-
pened to the ship's crew. The oxygen reser-
voirs were not empty, there were supplies of 
food and water sufficient for several years but 
nowhere was there any trace or any remains 
of Parus's crew. 

Here and there in the corridors, in the con-
trol tower and in the library there were strange 
dark stains on the walls. On the library floor 
there was another stain that looked as though 
something that had been spilled there had 
dried in a warped film of several layers. 
Before the open door in the after bulkhead 
of the stern engine room, wires had been 
torn 
apart 
and were 
hanging down, the 
massive uprights of the cooling system, made 
of phosphor-bronze, had been badly bent. 
Everything else in the ship was in perfect 
condition so that this damage, caused by a 
blow of tremendous force, could not be 
explained. 
The 
explorers 
were 
becoming 
exhausted by their efforts but were unable to 
find anything that would explain the disap-
pearance and undoubted loss of Parus's crew. 

They did, however, make another discove-
ry, one of the greatest importance—the sup-
plies for the take-off of Tantra and for the 
journey back to Earth. 

This information was immediately trans-
mitted to Tantra and relieved all members of 
the expedition of that feeling of doom that 
had possessed them since their spaceship had 

been captured by the iron star. Nor would 
they have to carry out the lengthy work 
necessary to transmit a message to Earth. 
There would be, however, the tremendous 
task of transferring the anameson containers 
to Tantra. This would not have been an easy 
task anywhere, but there, on a planet where 
everything weighed three times as much as 
on Earth, it would require all the skill and 
ingenuity of the engineers. People of the 
Great Circle Era, however, were not afraid 
of difficult mental problems; on the contrary, 
they enjoyed them. 

From 
the tape-recorder 
in 
the 
central 
control tower the biologist removed the un-
finished spool of the ship's log-book. Erg 
Noor and the biologist opened the door of the 
hermetically 
sealed main safe where 
the 
results of the Parus expedition were kept. 
The members of the expedition were bur-
dened down with a heavy weight of nume-
rous spools of photo-magnetic films, log-books, 
astronomical observations and computations. 
They were explorers themselves and could not 
dream of leaving such a valuable find even 
for a moment. 

Dead tired the explorers were met in 
Tantra's library by their excited and impa-
tient comrades. In surroundings to which they 
were accustomed, seated around a comfort-
able table under bright lights, the tomb-
like gloom of the black world outside and the 
dead, abandoned spaceship seemed like a 
qruesome nightmare. Nevertheless the force 
of gravity of that awful planet continued to 

crush every one of them and from time to 
time one or another of the explorers would 
grimace 
with 
pain 
on 
making 
some 
movement. It had been very difficult, without 
considerable practice, to coordinate the move-
ments of the body with those of the steel 
"skeleton" so that an ordinary walk became 
a series of jerks and severe shakings. The short 
journey to Parus and back had completely 
exhausted them. Geologist Beena Ledd was 
apparently suffering from a slight concussion 
of the brain, but she refused to go away 
before she had heard the last spool of the 
ship's log-book and remained leaning on the 
table with her hands pressed to her temples. 
Nisa expected something extraordinary from 
the records that had lain for eighty years in a 
dead ship on that horrid planet. She imagined 
hoarse appeals for help, howls of suffering, 
tragic words of farewell. The girl shuddered 
when a cold, melodious voice came from the 
loudspeaker. 
Even Erg Noor, a man who 
possessed 
great 
knowledge 
of 
everything 
connected 
with 
interstellar 
flights, 
knew 
nothing of the crew of Parus. The crew had 
been made up exclusively of young people 
who had set out on their fantastically coura-
geous journey to Vega without giving the 
Astronautical Council the usual film about 
the members of the crew. 

The unknown voice reported events that 
occurred seven months after the last message 
had been sent to Earth. Twenty-five years be-
fore that, in crossing a Cosmic ice zone on the 
fringe of the Vega system, Parus had been 

damaged. The crew managed to patch the 
hole in the ship's stern and continue their 
journey but it nevertheless upset the delicate 
regulation 
of 
the protective field of 
the 
motors. After a struggle that lasted1 twenty 
years they had to stop the engines. Parus 
continued going five years by inertia until 
she was pulled aside by a natural inaccuracy 
in the ship's course. That was when the first 
message had been sent. The spaceship was 
about to send another message when she was 
caught in the field of the iron star. Then the 
same thing happened to Parus as had hap-
pened to 
Tantra 
with the difference that 
Parus was without motors and had been 
unable to resist. Nor could Parus become a 
satellite of the black planet since the planeta-
ry motors, housed in the vessel's stern, had 
been wrecked at the same time as the aname-
son motors. Parus landed safely on a low 
plateau near the sea. The crew set about 
carrying out three tasks of importance: the 
repair of the motors, the transmission of a 
message to Earth and the study of the un-
known planet. Before they had time to erect a 
rocket 
tower 
people 
began to 
disappear 
mysteriously. Those sent out to look for them 
did not return. The exploration of the planet 
ceased, the remainder of the crew went out to 
the rocket tower only in a group and for the 
long periods between spells of work that the 
strong 
force 
of 
gravity 
made 
extremely 
exhausting, 
they 
remained 
in 
the tightly 
sealed spaceship. In their hurry to send off 
the rocket they had not even studied the 

strange spaceship in the vicinity of Parus that 
had, apparently, been there a long time. 

"That disc!" flashed through Nisa's mind. 
She met the commander's glance and he, 
understanding her thoughts, nodded in affir-
mation. Six out of the fourteen of Parus's 
crew had disappeared but after the necessary 
measures had been taken the disappearances 
stopped. There then followed a break of 
about three days in the log-book and the 
story was taken up by a young woman's 
high-pitched voice. 

"Today is the twelfth day of the seventh 
month, year 723 of the Great Circle, and we 
who 
have remained alive have completed 
the construction of the rocket transmitter. 
Tomorrow at this time..." 

Kay Bear glanced instinctively at the time 
gradations 
along 
the 
tape—5 
a.m. Parus 
time, and who could know what time that 
would be on this planet! 

"We are sending a reliably computed..." the 
voice broke off and then began again, this 
time weaker and suppressed, as though the 
speaker had turned away from the micro-
phone, "...I am switching on! Again!" The 
tape-recorder was silent although the tape 
continued to unwind. 

"Something must have happened!.." began 
Ingrid Dietra. 

Hurried, choking words came from the 
tape-recorder. 

"Two got away... Laik is gone, she didn't 
jump far enough ... the lift ... they couldn't 
shut the outside door, only the inside one! 

Mechanic Sach Kthon has crawled to the 
engines... we'll start the planetary 
motors 
going ... there is nothing to them but fury 
and horror, they are nothing! Yes, nothing..." 

For some time the tape unwound in si-
lence, then 
the same voice began again. 

"I 
don't think 
Kthon managed it. I'm 
alone, but I've thought of what to do. Before 
I begin," the voice grew stronger and then 
sounded with amazing strength. "Brothers, 
if you find Parus, take heed of my warning, 
never leave the ship at all." The woman who 
was speaking heaved a deep sigh and said, 
as though talking to herself, " I must find out 
about Kthon, I'll come back and explain in 
detail." Then came a click and the tape con-
tinued to unwind for about twenty minutes 
before it reached the end. The eager listeners 
waited in vain, the unknown woman had 
been unable to give any further detail just as 
she had probably been unable to return. 

Erg Noor switched off the apparatus and 
turned to his companions. 

"Our brothers and sisters who died in Parus 
will save us! Can't you feel the strong arm of 
the man of Earth! There's a supply of aname-
son on the ship and we've been given a warn-
ing of the mortal danger that threatens us. I 
have no idea what it is but it's undoubtedly 
some alien form of life. If it had been elemen-
tal, Cosmic forces, they'd have damaged the 
ship and not merely killed the people. 
It 
would be a disgrace if we could not save our-
selves now that we have been given so much 
help; we must take our discoveries and those 

of Parus back to Earth. The great work of 
those who perished at their posts, their half-
century's struggle against the Cosmos, must 
not have been in vain." 

"How do you propose to get the fuel on 
board without leaving the ship?"asked Kay Bear. 

"Why without leaving the ship? You know 
that's impossible and that we have to go out 
and work outside. We've been warned and 
we'll take the necessary steps." 

"I suppose you mean a barrage around the 
place where we're going to work," said biolo-
gist Eon Thai. 

"Not only that, a barrage along the whole 
way between the two ships," added Pour 
Hyss. 

"Naturally! We don't know what to expect 
so we'll make the barrage a double one, a 
radiation and an electric wall. We'll put out 
cables and have a path of light all the way. 
There's an unused rocket standing behind 
Parus that contains sufficient energy for all 
the time we'll have to work." 

Beena Ledd's head dropped on to the table 
with a thud. The doctor and the second astro-
nomer moved their heavy bodies with diffi-
culty towards her. 

"It's nothing," explained Louma Lasvy, 
"concussion 
and overstrain. 
Help me get 
Beena to bed." 

Even that simple task would not have 
been performed very quickly if mechanic 
Taron had not thought of adapting an auto-
matic robot car. With the help of the car 
all the eight explorers were taken to the 

beds—if they did not rest in time, organisms 
that had not yet adapted themselves to new 
conditions would break down. At this dif-
ficult moment every member of the expedi-
tion was essential and irreplaceable. 

Soon two 
universal automatic cars for 
transport purposes and road building were 
linked together and used to level the road 
between the two spaceships. Heavy cables 
were hung on both sides. Watch-towers with a 
protective hood of thick silicoborum15 were 
erected at each of the spaceships. In each to-
wer an observer from time to time would 
send a fan-shaped bunch of death-dealing 
hard rays along the road from an impulse 
chamber. During the hours of work the po-
werful searchlights were kept going all the 
time. The main hatch in Parus's keel was 
opened, some of the bulk heads were removed 
and four containers of anameson and thirty 
cylinders with ion charges were made ready 
to load on to the cars. It would be more 
difficult to load them on to Tantra. They 
could not open the spaceship the way Parus 
was opened and so allow whatever was en-
gendered by the alien life of the planet, and 
which was probably lethal, to enter the ship. 
For this reason they only made the necessary 
preparations 
inside the ship but did 
not 
open the hatch; interior bulkheads were re-
moved and containers 
of 
compressed air 
were brought from Parus. The plan was to 
blow a strong blast of air under high pressure 
down the shaft from the time the manhole 
was opened until the containers were loaded 

into Tantra. At the same time the hull of the 
vessel would be screened by a radiation cascade. 

The expedition gradually grew accustomed 
to working in their steel "skeletons" and 
began to bear the triple weight somewhat 
more easily. The unbearable pain in all their 
bones that had started as soon as they landed 
was also beginning to ease up. 

Several terrestrial days passed but the mys-
terious "nothing" did not appear. The tempe-
rature of the surrounding atmosphere began 
to fall rapidly. A hurricane arose that in-
creased in fury hour by hour. This was the 
setting of the black sun—the planet rotated 
and the continent on which the spaceship 
stood plunged into night. The convection cur-
rents, the heat given off by the ocean and the 
thick atmosphere prevented a sudden drop in 
temperature but towards the middle of the 
planetary "night" a sharp frost set in. The work 
continued with the heating systems in the 
spacesuits switched on. They had managed 
to get the first container out of Parus and 
transport it to 
Tantra 
when at "sunrise" 
there came a hurricane much fiercer than had 
been the one at "sunset". The temperature 
rose rapidly above freezing point, a current 
of dense air brought with it excessive humidi-
ty and the sky was rent by endless flashes 
of lightning. The hurricane became so fierce 
that the spaceship began to tremble under 
pressure of the terrific wind. The crew con-
centrated all their efforts on safely anchoring 
the container under Tantra's keel. The fearful 
roar of the wind increased and the dangerous 

whirling 
vortices 
on 
the 
plateau 
closely 
resembled terrestrial tornadoes. In the search-
light beam there appeared a huge whirlwind, 
a rotating column of water, snow and dust 
whose funnel reached the low dark sky. The 
whirlwind broke the high-voltage cables and 
there were blue flashes caused by short cir-
cuits as the ends coiled up. The yellow light 
of Parus's searchlight disappeared as though 
the wind had blown it out. 

Erg Noor gave the order to stop work and 
take cover in the ship. 

"But 
there 
is an observer there!" ex-
claimed geologist Beena Ledd, pointing to the 
faintly visible light of the silicoborum turret. 

"I know, Nisa's there and I'm going over 
there 
myself," 
answered the 
commander. 

"The current is cut off and 'nothing' has 
come into his own," said Beena in serious 
tones. 

"If the hurricane affects us it will no doubt 
also affect 'nothing'. I'm sure there's no dan-
ger until the storm dies down. I'm so heavy in 
this world that I won't be blown away if I 
crawl along the ground. I've been wanting 
to watch that 'nothing' from an observation 
turret for a long time." 

"May I come with you?" asked the biolo-
gist, jumping towards the commander. 

"Come 
along, only 
remember, 
I won't 
take anybody else! You need that..." 

The two men crawled for a long time, hang-
ing on to irregularities and cracks in the 
stones and keeping as far as possible out of 
the way of the whirlwinds. The hurricane did 

its best to tear them from the ground, turn 
them over and roll them along. Once it 
succeeded but Erg Noor managed to catch 
hold of Eon Thai as he rolled past, dropped 
flat on his stomach and caught hold of a big 
boulder with his hooked gloves. 

Nisa opened the hatch of her turret and the 
two men crawled into the narrow space. It 
was quiet and warm inside, the turret stood 
firm, securely anchored against the storms 
their wisdom had foreseen. The auburn-head-
ed astronavigator frowned but was glad to 
have companions. She frankly admitted that 
she was not looking forward to spending 
twenty-four 
hours alone in a storm on a 
strange planet. 

Erg Noor informed Tantra of their safe 
arrival and the searchlight was turned off. 
The tiny lamp in the turret was now the only 
light in that kingdom of darkness. The ground 
trembled under the gusts of wind, the light-
ning and the passing whirlwinds. Nisa sat in 
a revolving chair with her back against the 
rheostat. The commander and the biologist 
sat at her feet on the round ledge formed by 
the base of the turret. In their spacesuits they 
occupied almost all the space inside the 
turret. 

" I 
suggest we sleep," came Erg Noor's 
soft voice in the earphones. "It's a good 
twelve hours to the black sunrise when the 
storm dies down and it gets warmer." 

His companions readily agreed. And so the 
three of them slept, held down by triple 
weight, enclosed in their spacesuits, hampered 

by the stiff "skeletons" in the narrow con-
fines of the turret that was shaken by the 
storm. Great is the adaptability of the human 
organism and great its powers of resistance! 

From time to time Nisa woke up, transmit-
ted a reassuring message to the watcher on 
Tantra and dozed off again. The hurricane 
was blowing itself out and the tremors had 
ceased. The "nothing", or, more correctly, 
the "something" might appear now. The ob-
servers on the turret took VP, vigilance pills, 
to liven up a tired nervous system. 

"That other spaceship bothers me," con-
fessed Nisa. "I should so much like to know 
who they are, where they came from and how 
they got here." 

"So would I," answered Erg Noor, "only 
it's obvious how they got here. Stories of the 
iron stars and their planet traps have long 
been circulating round the Great Circle. In the 
more densely inhabited parts of the Galaxy, 
where ships have been making frequent trips 
for a long time already, there are planet grave-
yards of lost spaceships. Many ships, especial-
ly the earlier typds, got stuck to those planets 
and many hair-raising stories are told about 
them, stories that are almost legends today, 
the legends of the arduous conquest of the 
Cosmos. Perhaps there are older spaceships 
on this planet that belong to more ancient 
days, although the meeting of three ships in 
our sparsely populated part of the Galaxy 
is an extraordinary event. So far not a single 
iron star was known to exist in the vicinity 
of the Sun, we have discovered the first." 

"Do you intend to investigate the disc 
ship?" asked the biologist. 

"Most certainly! 
Could a scientist ever 
forgive himself if he let such an opportunity 
go? We don't know of any disc spaceships 
in regions neighbouring on our solar system. 
This must be a ship from a great distance that 
has, perhaps, been wandering about the Gala-
xy for several thousand years after the death 
of the crew or after some irreparable damage. 
Many transmissions round the Great Circle 
may become comprehensible to us when we 
get whatever material there is in the disc 
ship. It has a very queer form, it's a disc-
shaped spiral, the ribs on its exterior are 
very convex. As soon as we have transferred 
the cargo from Parus we'll start on that ship 
but at present we cannot take a single person 
away from work." 

"It took us only a few hours to investigate 
Parus." 

"I have examined the disc ship through a 
stereotelescope. It is sealed tight, not a single 
opening is to be seen anywhere. It is very dif-
ficult to penetrate into any Cosmic ship that 
is reliably protected against forces that are 
many times stronger than our terrestrial ele-
ments. Just try and get into Tantra, through 
her armour of metal with a reorganized in-
ternal crystal structure, through the borason 
plating—it would be a task equal to the siege 
of a fortress. It's still more difficult to deal 
with an alien ship, the principles of whose 
structure are unknown to us. But we'll make 
an attempt to find out what it is!" 

"When are we going to examine what we've 
found in Parus?" asked Nisa. "There should 
be some staggeringly interesting observations 
made in those marvellous worlds mentioned 
in the message." 

The earphone transmitted the commander's 
good-natured laugh. 

"I've been dreaming of Vega since child-
hood and am more impatient than any of 
you. But we'll have plenty of time for that 
on the way home. The first thing we have to 
do is get out of this darkness, out of this 
inferno, as they used to say in the old days. 
The Parus explorers did not make any land-
ings otherwise we should have found the 
things they brought from those worlds in 
the collection rooms of the ship. You remem-
ber that despite the thorough search we made 
we found only films, measurements, lists of 
surveys, air tests and containers of explosive 
dust." 

Erg Noor stopped talking and listened. 
Even the sensitive microphones did not regis-
ter the slightest breath of wind—the storm 
was over. A scraping, rustling sound came 
through the ground from outside and was 
echoed by the walls of the turret. 

The commander raised his hand and Nisa, 
who understood him without words, extin-
auished the light. The darkness seemed as 
dense inside the turret, warmed up with infra-
red rays, as if it were standing in black liquid 
on the bed of an ocean. Flashes of brown 
' 
!ght showed through the transparent hcod 
f silicoborum. The watchers clearly saw the 

lights burn up and for a second form tiny 
stars with dark-red or dark-green rays; they 
would go out and then appear again. These 
little stars stretched out in lines that wavered 
and bent into circles and figures of eight, 
and slid soundlessly over the smooth dia-
mond-hard surface of the hood. The people 
in the turret felt a strange, acute pain in their 
eyes and a sharp pain along the bigger nerves 
of the body as though the short rays of the 
brown stars were stabbing the nerve stems 
like needles. 

"Nisa," whispered Erg Noor, "turn the re-
gulator on to 'full' and switch on the light 
suddenly." 

The turret was lit up with a bright, bluish 
terrestrial light. The people were blinded by 
it 
and could 
see nothing, 
or 
practically 
nothing. Eon and Nisa managed to see—or did 
they imagine it?—that the darkness on the 
right-hand side of the turret did not disappear 
immediately but remained for a moment as 
a flattened condensation of gloom with ten-
tacles attached. The "something" instanta-
neously withdrew its tentacles and sprang 
back into the wall of darkness that the light 
had pushed farther from the turret. 

"Perhaps those are phantoms?" suggested 
Nisa, "phantom condensations of darkness 
around a charge of some sort of energy, like 
our fireballs, and not a form of life at all. If 
everything here is black why shouldn't the 
lightning be black, too?" 

"That's all very poetical, Nisa," objected 
Erg Noor, "but hardly likely. In the first place 

the 
'something' 
was 
obviously 
attacking, 
was after our living flesh. It or its brethren 
annihilated the people from Parus. If it's 
organized and stable, if it can move in the 
desired direction, if it can accumulate and 
discharge some form of energy, then, of 
course, there can be no question of an at-
mospheric phantom. It's something created 
from living matter and it's trying to devour 
us!" 

The biologist supported the commander's 
conclusion. 

" I t seems to me that here, on this planet 
of darkness, it's dark for us alone because our 
eyes are not sensitive to the infra-red rays of 
the heat end of the spectrum, but the other 
end of the spectrum, the yellow and blue 
rays, 
should 
affect 
these 
creatures 
very 
strongly. 
Its reaction is so swift that the 
crew of Parus could not see anything when 
they illuminated the site of the attack and if 
they did see anything it was already too late 
and they 
were unable to tell 
anybody." 

"Let's repeat the experiment, even if the 
approach of that thing is unpleasant." 

Nisa switched off the light and again the 
three observers sat in profound darkness 
awaiting the approach of the denizens of the 
world of darkness. 

"What 
is 
it 
armed with? 
Why 
is its 
approach felt through the hood and the space-
suit?" asked the biologist aloud. "Is it some 
new form of energy?" 

"There are few forms of energy and this is 
most 
likely 
electromagnetic. 
There 
is no 

doubt that countless modifications of this 
form of energy exist. This being has a weapon 
that affects our nervous system. You can 
imagine what it would be like if those feelers 
were 
to 
touch 
the 
unprotected 
body!" 

Erg Noor flinched and Nisa Creet shud-
dered inwardly as they noticed the line of 
brown lights rapidly approaching from three 
sides. 

"There isn't just one being!" exclaimed 
Eon, softly. "Perhaps we ought not let them 
touch the hood." 

"You're right. Let each of us turn his back 
on the light and look in one direction only. 
Nisa, switch on!" 

On this occasion each of the observers 
noted some details that could be combined to 
give a general impression of creatures like 
huge flat jelly-fish, floating low over the 
ground with a dense fringe waving in the 
air below them. Some of the feelers were 
short when compared with the dimensions 
of the creature and could not have been more 
than a yard long. The acute-angled corners 
of the rhomboid body each had two feelers 
of much greater length. At the base of the feel-
ers the biologist noticed huge bladders that 
glowed inside and seemed to be transmitting 
the star-like flashes along them. 

"Hullo, observers, why are you switching 
the light on and off?" came Ingrid's clear 
voice in the helmet earphones. "Are you in 
need of help? The storm's over and we're 
going to begin work. We're coming to you 
now." 

"Stay where you are," ordered the com-
mander. "There is great danger abroad. Call 
everybody!" 

Erg Noor told them about the terrible 
lelly-fish. After a consultation the explorers 
decided to move part of a planetary motor 
forward on an automatic car. An exhaust 
flame three hundred metres long swept across 
the stony place removing everything visible 
and invisible from its path. Before half an 
hour had passed the crew had repaired the 
broken cables and protection was restored. 
They realized that the anameson fuel must 
be loaded before the planet's night came 
again; at the cost of superhuman effort it 
was done and the exhausted travellers retired 
behind the armour of their tightly sealed 
spaceship and listened calmly as it trembled 
in the storm. Microphones brought the roar 
and rumble of the hurricane to them but it 
only served to make more cosy the little 
world of light impregnable to the powers of 
darkness. 

Ingrid and Louma opened the stereoscreen. 
The film had been well chosen. The blue wa-
ters of the Indian Ocean splashed at the feet 
of those sitting in the ship's library. The film 
showed the Neptune Games, the worldwide 
competition in all types of aquatic sports. In 
the Great Circle Era the entire world's popula-
tion had grown accustomed to water in a way 
that had only been possible for the maritime 
peoples in earlier days. Swimming, diving and 
plunging, surf-board riding and the sailing of 
rafts had become universal sports. Thousands 

of beautiful young bodies, tanned by the sun, 
ringing songs, laughter, the festive music of 
the finals... 

Nisa leaned towards the biologist, who 
sat beside her deep in thought, carried away 
in his mind to the far distant planet that was 
his, to that dear planet where nature had been 
harnessed by man. 

"Did you ever take part in these competi-
tions, Eon?" 

The biologist looked at her somewhat puz-
zled. 

"What? Oh, these? No, never. I was think-
ing and didn't understand you at first." 

"Weren't you thinking about that?" asked 
the girl, pointing to the screen. "Don't you 
find your appreciation of beauty of 
our 
world comes so much fresher to you after 
all this darkness, after the storms and the 
jelly-fish?" 

"Of course I do, but that only makes me all 
the more anxious to get hold of one of those 
jelly-fish. I was racking my brains over that, 
trying to think of a way to capture one." 

Nisa Creet turned away from the smiling 
biologist and met Erg Noor's smile. 

"Have you, too, been thinking about how 
to catch that black horror?" she asked, mock-
ingly. 

"No, but I was thinking of how to explore 
the disc-shaped spaceship," he said and the sly 
glint in the commander's eyes almost annoyed 
Nisa. 

"Now I understand why it is that men en-
gaged in wars in the old days! I used to think 

it was only the boastfulness of your sex, the 
so-called 
strong sex of 
that 
unorganized 
society." 

"You're not quite right although you are 
pretty near to understanding our old-time 
psychology. My ideas are simple—the more 
beautiful I find my planet, the more I get to 
love it, the more I want to serve it, to plant 
gardens, extract metals, produce power and 
food, create music, so that when I have passed 
on my way I shall leave behind me a little 
piece of something real made by my hands 
and my head. The only thing I know is the 
Cosmos, astronautics, and that is the only 
way I can serve mankind. The goal is not the 
flight itself but the acquisition of fresh knowl-
edge, the discovery of new worlds which we 
shall, in time, turn into planets as beautiful 
as our Earth. And what aim have you in 
view, Nisa? Why are you so interested in the 
disc spaceship? Is it mere curiosity?" 

With a great effort the girl overcame the 
weight of her tired arms and stretched them 
out to the commander. He took her little 
hands in his and stroked them gently. Nisa's 
cheeks flushed till they matched the tight 
auburn curls on her 
head, new strength 
flowed through her tired body. She pressed 
her cheek to Erg Noor's hand as she had done 
in the moment of the dangerous landing and 
she forgave the biologist his seeming treachery 
to Earth. To show that she was in agreement 
with both of them she told them of an idea 
that had just entered her head. They could 
furnish one of the watertanks with a self-

closing iid, place a piece of fresh preserved 
meat (a rare luxury that they sometimes 
enjoyed in addition to their canned food) 
as bait and, should the "black something" 
crawl inside and the lid close, they could fill 
the tank with inert terrestrial gas through a 
previously arranged tap and seal the edges of 
the lid. 

Eon was very enthusiastic over the re-
sourcefulness of the auburn-headed girl. He 
was almost the same age as Nisa and permitt-
ed himself the gentle familiarity that is born 
of school years spent together. By the end of 
the nine days of the planetary night the trap, 
perfected by the engineers, was ready. 

Erg Noor was busy with the adjustment 
of a manlike robot and he also got ready a 
powerful hydraulic cutting tool with which 
he hoped to make his way into the spiral-disc 
from some distant star. 

The storm died down in the now familiar 
darkness, the frost gave way to warmth and 
the day that was nine terrestrial 
days long 
began. They had work for four terrestrial days 
to load the ion charges, some other supplies 
and valuable instruments. In addition to these 
things Erg Noor considered it necessary to 
take some of the personal belongings of the 
lost crew so that, after a thorough disinfec-
tion, they could be taken to Earth for the 
relatives of the dead people to keep in their 
memory. In the Great Circle Era people did 
not burden themselves with many possessions 
so that their transfer to Tantra offered no dif-
ficulties. 

On the fifth day they switched off the cur-
rent and the biologist and two volunteers, 
Kay Bear and Ingrid Dietra, shut themselves 
up in the observation turret at Parus. The 
black creatures appeared almost immediately. 
The biologist had adapted an infra-red screen 
and could follow the movements of the jelly-
fish. One of them soon approached the tank 
trap; it folded up its tentacles, rolled itself 
up into a ball and started creeping inside. Sud-
denly another black rhombus appeared at 
the open lid of the tank. The one that had 
first arrived unfolded its tentacles and star-
like flashes came with such rapidity that they 
njmed into a strip of vibrant dark-red light 
which the screen reproduced as flashes of 
green lightning. The first jelly-fish moved 
back and the second immediately rolled up 
into a ball and fell on to the bottom of the 
tank. The biologist held his hand out towards 
the switch but Kay Bear held it back. The 
first monster had also rolled up and followed 
the second, so that there were two of the ter-
rible brutes in the tank. It was amazing that 
they could reduce their apparent proportions 
to such an extent. The biologist pressed the 
switch, the lid closed and immediately five or 
six of the black monsters fastened on to the 
zirconium-covered tank. The biologist turned 
on the light and asked Tantra to switch on the 
nrotection of the road. The black phantoms, 
as usual, dissolved immediately except for the 
two that remained imprisoned in the hermeti-
cally sealed tank. 

The biologist went out to the tank, touched 

the lid and got such a severe shock that he 
could not restrain himself and shouted out 
aloud. His left arm hung limp, paralyzed. 

Mechanic Taron put on a high-temperature 
protective spacesuit and was then able to fill 
the tank with pure terrestrial nitrogen and 
weld the lid down. The taps were also welded 
and then the tank was wrapped in a spare 
piece of ship's insulation and placed in the 
collection room. Success had been achieved 
at a high 
price, for 
the 
biologist's arm 
remained paralyzed despite the efforts of the 
physician. Eon Thai was in great pain but he 
did not dream of refusing to take part in the 
expedition to the disc ship. Erg Noor, com-
pelled to submit to his insatiable thirst for 
exploration, could not leave him on Tantra. 

The 
spiral-disc, 
a visitor 
from 
distant 
worlds, turned out to be farther from Parus 
than they had expected. In the diffused light 
of the searchlights they had not judged the 
size of the spaceship correctly. It was a truly 
gigantic structure nearly three hundred and 
fifty metres in diameter. They had to take the 
cables from Parus in order to stretch their 
protective system as far as the disc. The mys-
terious spaceship hung over the travellers like 
a vertical wall, stretching high over their 
heads and disappearing in the speckled sky. 
Jet-black clouds massed around the upper 
edge of the giant disc. The hull of the vessel 
was covered in some green substance the co-
lour of malachite; it was badly cracked in 
places and proved to be about a metre thick. 
Through the cracks gleamed some bright, 

light-blue metal that had turned to a dark 
blue in places where the malachite covering 
had been rubbed off. The side of the disc 
facing Parus was furnished with a protube-
rance that curved in a spiral fifteen metres in 
diameter and some ten metres thick. The 
other side of the disc, the side that was 
lost in the pitch darkness, was more convex, 
like a section of a sphere attached to a disc 
twenty metres thick. On that side also there 
was a spiral protuberance that looked like 
the end of the spiral pipe emerging from the 
ship. 

The edge of the gigantic disc was sunk deep 
into the ground. At the foot of this metal 
wall the explorers saw that stones had melted 
and flowed away in all directions like thick 
pitch. 

They spent many hours looking for some 
sort of entrance or hatch. Either it was hidden 
under the malachite paint or dross or the 
ship's hatches closed so neatly that no trace 
of them was left outside. They could not find 
any orifices for optical instruments or stop-
cocks for any sort of blast. The metal disc 
seemed to be solid. Erg Noor had foreseen 
such a possibility and had decided to open up 
the ship with an electro-hydraulic tool capab-
le of cutting through the hardest and most vis-
cous covering of the terrestrial spaceships. 
After a short discussion they all agreed that 
the robot should open the tip of the spiral. 
There should be a hollow space there, a pipe 
or a circular gangway leading round the ship, 
through which they hoped to get into the ship 

without the 
risk of running into a number 
of 
bulkheads 
that 
would 
bar their 
way. 

The study of the spiral-disc would be of 
great interest. Inside this visitor from dis-
tant worlds there might be instruments and 
records, all the furniture and utensils of those 
who had brought the ship through such ex-
panses that, 
in 
comparison, the 
journeys 
made by terrestrial astronauts were nothing 
but timid sallies into outer space. 

On the far side of the disc the spiral came 
right down to the ground. A floodlight and 
high voltage cable were taken there and the 
bluish light that was reflected from the disc 
was dispersed in a dull haze spreading across 
the plateau as far as some high objects of in-
definite shape, probably cliffs, in which there 
was a gap of impenetrable blackness. Neither 
the pale reflected light of the hazy stars nor 
the floodlights gave any feeling of ground 
in that black gap; it was probably a steep 
slope leading down to the lowland plain that 
had been seen when 
Tantra 
was landing. 

With a low, dull growl the automatic car, 
loaded with the only universal robot on the 
ship, crawled towards the disc. The unusual 
weight did not make any difference to the 
robot and it moved quickly to its place beside 
the metal wall; it resembled a fat man on 
short legs, with a long body and a huge head 
that leaned forward menacingly. 

The robot was controlled by Erg Noor; 
in its four front limbs it raised the heavy 
cutter and stood with its legs placed firmly 
apart, ready to begin its dangerous undertaking. 

"Only Kay Bear and I will direct the robot 
since we are wearing high-protection suits/' 
said the commander in the intercommunica-
tion phone. "All those in light biological 
spacesuits will go farther away." 

The commander hesitated. Something pe-
netrated into his mind causing inexplicable 
anguish and made his knees weaken under 
him. The proud will of man had wilted 
away and given place to the dumb obedience 
of an animal. Sticky with perspiration from 
head to foot, Erg Nooi, vvith no will of his 
own, strode towards the black gap in the 
darkness. A cry from Nisa that he heard in 
the earphone, brought him back xo his senses. 
He stood still, but the power of darkness thet 
had taken control of his psyche again drove 
him forward, 

Following 
the commander, 
halting and 
obviously struggling with themselves, went 
Kay Bear and Eon Thai, who had been stand-
ing on the fringe of the circle of light. Away 
out there, in the gates of darkness, in the 
clouds of mist, there was a movement of 
weird forms beyond the comprehension of 
man and, therefore, the more awe-inspiring. 
This was not the now familiar jelly-fish-like 
creature—in the grey half-light there moved 
a black cross with widely outstretched arms 
and a convex ellipse in the middle. Three 
points of the cross had lenses on them reflect-
ing the light of the floodlarnp that scarcely 
penetrated the misty, humid atmosphere. The 
base of the cross was invisible in the darkness of 
an unilluminated depression in the ground. 

Erg Noor, who was walking faster than the 
others, drew near the unknown object and 
fell to the ground about a hundred paces 
away from it. Before the stupefied onlookers 
could realize that it was a life and death 
matter 
for 
their 
commander, 
the 
black 
cross had risen above the ring of cables. It 
bent forward like the stem of a plant and 
clearly intended leaning over the protective 
field to get Erg Noor. 

Nisa, in a frenzy that lent her the strength 
of an athlete, ran to the robot and started 
turning the control levers at the back of its 
head. Slowly and somewhat uncertainly, the 
robot lifted the cutter. Then the girl, afraid 
that she would be unable to work the intri-
cate machine, jumped forward and with her 
body 
covered the commander. 
Serpentine 
streams of light or lightning came from the 
three points of the cross. The girl fell on 
Erg Noor with her arms spread out on either 
side. Fortunately the robot had by this time 
turned the funnel of the cutter, with its 
sharp instrument inside, towards the centre 
of the black cross. The thing bent convulsive-
ly backwards, seemed to fall flat on the 
ground and then disappeared in the impene-
trable darkness under the cliffs. Erg Noor 
and his two companions immediately recov-
ered, lifted up the girl and retired back behind 
the disc. The others had by this time recov-
ered from the shock and were wheeling out 
the cannon 
improvised from 
a planetary 
motor. With a savage ferocity such as he had 
never before experienced. Erg Noor directed 

the destructive radiation beam to the cliffs 
with their gate-like gap, taking special care to 
sweep the plain without missing a single inch. 
Eon Thai knelt on the ground in front of the 
motionless Nisa, calling her softly in the tele-
phone and trying to get a glimpse of her face 
through the silicolloid helmet. The girl lay 
dead still with her eyes closed. No sound of 
breathing could be heard in the telephone nor 
could the biologist detect it through the 
spacesuit. 

"The monster has killed Nisa!" cried Eon 
Thai bitterly, as soon as Erg Noor approached 
them. It was impossible to see the comman-
der's eyes through the narrow slit in the high-
protection helmet. 

"Take her to Louma on Tantra immedia-
tely." 
The metallic note resounded more 
strongly than ever in Erg Noor's voice. "You, 
too, help her find out the nature of the in-
jury. The six of us will remain here and con-
tinue the investigation. The geologist can go 
back with you and collect specimens of all 
the rocks between here and Tantra—we 
can-
not remain on this planet any longer. Any 
exploration here must be carried out in high-
protection tanks but if we go on like this 
we'll only ruin the whole expedition! Take 
the third car and hurry!" 

Erg Noor turned round and without look-
ing back made his way to the disc spaceship. 
The 
"cannon" 
was pushed forward. The 
engineer-mechanic 
who 
stood 
behind 
it 
swept the plain with it every ten minutes, 
covering a semicircle, with the disc at its 

centre. The robot raised his cutter to the sec-
ond outer loop of the spiral which, on the 
side where the edge of the disc was deeply 
sunk in the ground, was ievel with the robot's 
breast. 

The 
loud roar that followed could be 
heard 
even 
through 
the 
high-protection 
space helmets. Thin cracks appeared on the 
section of the malachite coating that had 
been chosen. Pieces of that hard material 
flew off and struck resoundingly against the 
metal body of the robot. Lateral motions of 
the cutter removed a big slab of the outer 
layer revealing a bright light-blue granular 
surface that was pleasant to the eyes even in 
the glare of the floodiamp. Kay Bear marked 
out a square big enough to allow a man in a 
spacesuit to pass and set the robot to making 
a deep channel in the blue metal without cut-
ting right through it. The robot cut a second 
line at an angle to the first and then began 
moving the sharp end of the cutter back 
and forth, increasing the pressure as it did so. 
When the mechanical servant cut the third 
side of the square the lines he had made 
began to move outwards. 

"Look out! Get back, everybody, lie down!" 
howled Erg Noor in the microphone as he 
switched off the robot and staggered bacK. 
The thick slab of metal suddenly bent out-
wards like the lid of a tin can. A stream of 
extraordinarily bright, rainbow-colourec fire 
burst out of the hole, and f(ew off at a 
tangent from the spiral protuberance, 
this, 
and tne tact tnat trie blue nicual ifieued 

?nd immediately dosed the hole that had 
been cut, saved the unfortunate explorers. 
Nothing remained of the mighty robot but 
a mass of molten metal with two short metal 
!eqs sticking pitifully out of it. Erg Noor and 
Kay Bear escaped because of the high-protec-
tion suits they were wearing. The explosion 
threw them far back from the peculiar space-
ship; it hurled the others back, too, over-
turned the "cannon" and broke the high-
voltage cables 

When the people reoovered from the shock 
ihey 
realized that they were 
defenceless. 
Fortunately for them they were lying in the 
ays of the undamaged floodlamp. Although 
nobody had been hurt Erg Noor decided that 
they had had enough. They abandoned un-
necessary tools, cables and the floodlamp, 
piled on to the undamaged car and beat a 
hurried retreat to their spaceship. 

This fortunate outcome of an incautious 
attempt to open an alien spaceship was by 
no means due to the foresight of the com-
mander 
A second attempt would have end-
ed with some serious accident... And Nisa, 
the 
pretty 
astronavigator, 
what 
of 
her?.. 
r r g Noor hoped that the spacesuit would 
^avp weakened the lethal power of the black 
ross. After all the biologist had not been 
killed by contact with the black jelly-fish. 
But out in the Cosmos, so far from the 
eighty terrestrial medical institutions, would 
'hey be able to counteract the effects of an 
mknown weapon? 

In the air-lock Kay Bear drew near to the 

commander and pointed to the rear side of his 
left 
shoulder 
armour. 
Erg 
Noor 
turned 
towards the mirrors that were always provid-
ed in the locks for those who returned from 
an alien planet to examine themselves. The 
thin sheet of zircono-titanium of which the 
shoulder armour was made had been torn. 
A piece of sky-blue metal stuck out of the 
furrow it had cut in the insulation lining 
although it had not reached the inner layer 
of the suit. They had difficulty in removing 
the metal splinter. At the cost of great risk 
and, in the final analysis, by sheer chance, 
they had obtained a specimen of the myste-
rious metal of which the spiral-disc space-
ship was made and which would now be 
taken back to Earth. 

At last Erg Noor, divested of his heavy 
spacesuit, was able to enter his ship or rather 
to crawl in under the influence of the gravity 
of the fearful planet. 

The entire expedition was relieved when he 
arrived. They had watched the catastrophe 
at the disc through their stereovisophones 
and had no need to ask what the result had 
been. 

Chapter Four 

T H E R I V E R OF T I M E 

Veda Kong and Darr Veter were standing 
on the little round flying platform as it swept 
slowly over the endless steppes. The thick, 
flowering grasses rolled in waves under the 
gentle breeze. In the distance they could 
see a herd of black and white cattle, the 
descendants of animals bred by crossing yaks, 
domestic cows and buffaloes. 

This unchanging lowland with its low hills 
and quiet rivers in wide valleys, a part of 
Earth's crust once known as the Khanty-
Mansi Territory, breathed the peace of great 
open spaces. 

Darr 
Veter was gazing 
contemplatively 
at the land that had formerly been covered 
with the dismal swamps and sparse, stunted 
woods of Yamal. It brought to mind a picture 

Dy an old master that had impressed itself 
on his memory when he was still a child. 

Where the river curved round a high pro-
montory, there stood a church, timber-built 
and grey with time, its lonely gaze turned 
towards the wide fields and grasslands across 
the river. The tiny cross on the dome was 
black under masses of low, black clouds. In 
the little graveyard behind the church a clus-
ter of birches and willows bowed their tousled 
heads to the wind. Their low-hanging boughs 
almost brushed the rotting crosses, thrown 
down by time and storm and overgrown with 
fresh damp grass. Across the river gigantic 
violet-grey masses of cloud were piling up 
until they became tangibly dense. The wide 
river gave off a cruel, steel-coloured gleam, a 
cold gleam that lay on everything round 
about. The whole countryside, far and near, 
was wet in the miserable autumn drizzle, so 
cold and uninviting in those northern la-
titudes. The whole palette of blue-grey-green 
tones used in the picture told of stretches of 
barren land, where it was hard for man to live, 
where 
man was cold and hungry, where 
he felt so strongly the loneliness that was 
typical of the long-forgotten davs of human 
folly. 

This picture, seen In a museum, had seemed 
to Darr Veter to be a window looking into 
the past; it was kept under a plexiglass shield, 
its colours ever fresh in the illumination of 
invisible rays. 

Without a word Darr veter ioo«ed j t Veda. 
Trie young woman put her hands on the rail 

around the platform. With her head bent she 
-tood there, deep in thought, watching the 
stems of the tall grass as they bent to the 
wind. Wave after wave swept slowly across 
the 
feather-grass 
and equally 
slowly 
the 
round 
platform 
floated 
over the 
steppe. 
Tiny hot whirlwinds rushed suddenly on the 
travellers, ruffled Veda's hair and dress and 
breathed heat mischievouslv into Darr Veter's 
eyes. 
The 
automatic 
stabilizer, 
however, 
worked more rapidly than thoughts and the 
flying platform merely heaved or swayed 
slightly. 

Darr Veter bent over the chart frame: 
the strip of map was moving quickly showing 
their movement—hadn't they flown too far 
north? They had crossed the sixtieth parallel 
some time before, had passed the junction of 
the Irtysh and the Ob and were approaching 
the plateau known as the North Siberian 
Jval or Highlands. 

The two travellers had become accustomed 
to the open country during their four months 
at the excavation of ancient grave mounds in 
the hot steppes of the Altai lowlands, It was 

a s though the e x D l o r e r s of the past had trav-
elled back to times when only occasional 
small parties of armed horsemen crossed the 
southern steppes... 

Veda turned and oointed ahead without a 
word. A dark island, seemingly torn off from 
the earth was floating in streams of heated 
air. A few minutes later the platform ap-
proached a small hill, probably the slag-heap 
of what had once been a mine. There was 

nothing left of the buildings and the p i t -
just that slag-heap overgrown with wild cherry. 

The round flying platform suddenly listed. 
Darr 
Veter, acting like an automaton, 
seized Veda by the waist and jumped to the 
opposite, 
rising side of 
the 
platform. 
It 
straightened out for a fraction of a second 
only to crash down flat at the foot of the 
hill. The shock absorbers took the shock and 
the recoil hurtled Veda Kong and Darr Veter 
out on to the hillside where they landed in a 
clump of 
stiff 
bushes. 
After 
a 
minute's 
silence the stillness of the steppe was broken 
by Veda's low, contralto laugh. Darr Veter 
tried to picture the look of astonishment on 
his own 
scratched face. The moment 
of 
surprised stupefaction passed and he joined 
in Veda's merriment, glad that she was un-
harmed and that there were no ill results from 
the accident. 

"There's a good reason for forbidding these 
platforms to fly higher than eight metres," 
she said with a slight gasp, "now I under-
stand." 

" I f anything goes wrong the machine drops 
down in a second and you have to rely entire-
ly on the shock absorbers. What else can you 
expect, it's the price you have to pay for lit-
tle weight and compactness. I'm afraid we'll 
have to pay a still higher price for all the safe 
flights we've had," said Darr Veter with an 
indifference that was slightly 
exaggerated. 

"In what way?" asked Veda, seriously. 
"The faultless functioning of the stabiliz-
ing instruments presupposes very intricate me-

chanisms. I'm afraid I should need a long time 
to find out how they work. We'll have to get 
away from here in the way the poorest of 
our ancestors did." 

Veda, with a sly glint in her eyes, held 
her hand out to Darr Veter and he lifted 
her out of the bushes with an easy move-
ment. They went down to the wrecked plat-
form, put some healing salve on their scratches 
and glued up the tears in their clothes. 
Veda lay down in the shade of a bush and 
Darr Veter began to study the causes of the 
mishap. As he had suspected, something had 
gone wrong with the stabilizer, and it had cut 
out the engine. No sooner had Darr Veter 
opened the lid of the apparatus than he 
realized that there could be no question of 
repairing it—it would take him too long to 
delve into the nature of the intricate electro-
nics before he could even start on it. With a 
sigh of annoyance he straightened his aching 
back and glanced at the bush where Veda 
Kong had curled herself up trustfully. The hot 
silent steppe, as far as the eye could see, was 
devoid of people. Two big birds of prey 
circled over the shimmering blue haze. 

The obedient machine had become nothing 
more than a dead disc that lay helpless on the 
dry earth. Darr Veter experienced a strange 
feeling of loneliness, of being cut off from the 
whole 
world, something that 
came from 
inside him where it had existed apart from 
his mind in the dull memory of his body's 
cells. 

At the same time he was not afraid of 

anything. 
Let night come, the naked eye 
would see over greater distances and they 
would certainly see a light somewhere that 
they could make for. They had been flying 
without luggage and had not even taken a 
radiotelephone, torches or food with them, 

"There was a time when we could have 
died in the steppes if we had not had a suffi-
cient supply of food with us ... and water!" 
thought Veter, shielding his eyes from the 
bright sunlight. He noted a patch of shade 
under a cherry bush near Veda and stretched 
himself, carefree, on the ground, the dry 
grass stalks pricking his body through his 
light clothing. The soft rustling of the wind 
and the heat brought forgetfulness, thoughts 
flowed drowsily, and pictures of 
long-for-
gotten days passed slowly, one after another, 
through his memory, a long procession of 
ancient peoples, tribes and individuals... It 
was as though a gigantic river of time were 
flowing out of the past, with the events, 
people and clothes changing every second. 

"Veter!" Through his sleepiness he heard 
the voice of his beloved calling him; awaken-
ing he sat up. The red ball of the sun was 
already touching the darkening horizon and 
not the slightest breath of wind was to be 
felt in the still air. 

" M y 
Lord 
Veter," said Veda 
playfully 
bowing before him in imitation of the women 
of ancient Asia, "would you deem it un-
worthy to awaken and remember my exis-
tence?" 

Darr Veter did a few physical jerio- to anve 

away sleep. Veda agreed with his plan to 
await darkness. Nightfall found them engaged 
in a lively discussion of their past work. 
Suddenly Darr Veter noticed that Veda was 
shivering. Her hands were cold and he realized 
that her iight clothing was not much pro-
tection against the cold nights of those high 
latitudes. 

The summer night on the sixtieth parallel 
was quite light and they were able to gather 
a fairly large piie of twigs. 

An electric spark discharged by the ma-
chine's big accumulator gave Darr Veter fire 
and the bright flames of burning brushwood 
soon made the surrounding darkness blacker 
as it showered its life-giving warmth on the 
travellers. 

Shivering Veda soon opened out again like 
a flower in the sunlight and the two of them 
fell into a sort of almost hypnotic reverie. 
Somewhere deep down in man's spirit, ieft 
over from that hundred thousand years during 
which fire had been his chief aiyium and his 
salvation, there remained that eradicable sense 
of comfort and calm that comes over people 
sitting by a fire surrounded by cold and dark-
ness. 

"What's worrying you, Veda?" said Darr 
Veter, disturbing the silence; there were signs 
of sorrow sn the lines ot his companion's 
mouth. 

" I was thinking of that woman, the one in 
the kerchief, " answered Veda, quietly, her 
eyes fixed on the burning embers that were 
collapsing in a shower of goM, 

Darr Veter understood her immediately. 
The day before their trip on the flying plat-
form they had completed the opening of a 
big Scythian kurgan or grave mound. Inside 
the well-preserved log vault lay the skeleton 
of an old man, a chieftain; the vault was 
surrounded 
by 
the bones of 
horses and 
slaves lying round the fringe of the mound. 
The old chieftain lay with his sword, shield 
and armour beside him, and at his feet was 
the skeleton of a quite young woman in a 
crouching position. Over the skull lay a silk 
kerchief that had at some time been tightly 
wound about her face. Despite all their efforts 
they had not managed to preserve the ker-
chief although, before it had fallen to dust, 
they had succeeded in copying the outlines 
of the beautiful face impressed on it thous-
ands of years before. The kerchief preserved 
another awful detail—the imprint of eyes 
starting out of their sockets; the young wom-
an 
had 
undoubtedly 
been strangled 
and 
then thrown 
into her husband's tomb to 
accompany him on his journey into the un-
known world beyond the grave. She could 
not have been more than nineteen, her hus-
band no less than seventy, a ripe old age for 
those days. 

Darr Veter recalled the heated discussion 
that had taken place between the younger 
members of Veda's expedition. Had the wo-
man followed him to the grave willingly or 
had she been forced to it? Why? For the sake 
of what? If she followed him for a great and 
devoted love, why had she been killed instead 

of being treasured as the best memorial to 
him in the world he was leaving. 

Then Veda Kong spoke. For a long time 
she had been looking at the grave mound, her 
eyes shining, trying to penetrate mentally into 
the depths of the past. 

"Try 
to 
understand those people. The 
great expanse of the steppe was to them really 
boundless, with horses, camels and oxen as 
the only means of transport at their disposal. 
These great spaces were inhabited by little 
groups of nomad herdsmen that not only 
had nothing to unite them but who were, 
on the contrary, living in constant enmity 
with 
one another. 
Insults and 
animosity 
accumulated from generation to generation, 
every stranger was an enemy, every other 
tribe was legitimate prey that promised herds 
and slaves, that is, people who were forced to 
work under the whip, like cattle... Such a 
system of society brought about, on the one 
hand, greater liberty for the individual in his 
petty passions and desires than we know and, 
dialectically, on the other, excessive limita-
tion in relations between people, a terrible 
narrow-mindedness. If a nation or tribe con-
sisted of a small number of people capable of 
feeding themselves by hunting and the gather-
ing of fruits, even as free nomads they lived in 
constant fear of enslavement or annihilation 
by their militant neighbours. In cases when 
the country was isolated and had a big popu-
lation 
capable of 
setting up a 
powerful 
military 
force the 
people 
paid for their 
safety from warlike raids by the loss of their 

liberty, since despotism and tyranny always 
developed in such powerful states. This was 
the case with ancient Egypt, Assyria and 
Babylon. 

"Women, especially if they were beauti-
ful, were the prey and the playthings of the 
strong. 
They could not exist without the 
protection of a man and were completely in 
his power. If the man who owned them died, 
nothing was left to them but an unknown 
and joyless life at the cruel and greedy hands 
of another man. Her own will and endeavours 
meant so little for a woman ... so terribly 
little, that when she was faced with such a 
life ... who knows, perhaps death may have 
seemed the easier way." 

Veda's ideas created a great impression on 
the young people. The finds in the Scythian 
grave 
mound 
were 
something 
that 
Darr 
Veter, too, would never forget. As though 
reading his thoughts Veda moved closer and 
slowly stirred the burning twigs, following 
with her eyes the blue tongues of flame that 
ran across the coals. 

"What a tremendous amount of courage 
and fortitude was needed to be oneself in 
those days, not to become degraded but to 
make one's way in life," Veda Kong said 
softly. 

" I t seems to me that we exaggerate the 
difficulties of life in ancient days," said Darr 
Veter. "Quite apart from the fact that people 
were used to it, the chaotic nature of society 
was the cause of a variety of incidental hap-
penings. Man's strength and will-power struck 

flashes of romantic joy out of that life in 
the same way as steel strikes sparks from 
grey stone. I shudder more at the last stages 
of development of capitalist society, towards 
the end of the Era of Disunity, when the 
people, shut up in towns, cut off from nature, 
exhausted 
by 
monotonous 
labour, 
grew 
weaker and more indifferent as they suc-
cumbed to widespread diseases." 

"I am also at a loss to understand why it 
took our ancestors so long to understand the 
simple fact that the fate of society depended 
on them alone, that a community is what the 
moral and ideological development of all its 
members makes it, that it depends wholly 
on the economy..." 

"The perfect form of scientifically organized 
society is not merely a quantitative accu-
mulation of productive forces but d qualita-
tive stage in development. It's all really very 
simple," answered Darr Veter. "Furthermore, 
there is the understanding of dialectical inter-
dependence, that new social relations are as 
improbable without new people as are the 
new people without the new economy. When 
.nis was realized it lad to the greatest atten-
tion being paid to education, to the physical 
and mental development of man. When was 
chis finally realized?" 

"In the Era cf Disunity, at the end of the 
Fission Age, soon after the Second Great 
devolution." 

"It's a good thing it aidn't co.ne later! The 
lestructive means of war..." 

Darr Veter stopped sjdderly 3rd turned 

towards the open space between the fire and 
the hill. The thunder of heavy hoofs arltl pant-
ing breath came from somewhere near by, 
making the two 
travellers jump to their 
feet. 

A gigantic black bull appeared before the 
fire. The flames were reflected in blood-red 
lights in his wicked rolling eyes. He was 
snorting and pawing up the dry ground, ob-
viously contemplating an attack. In the feeble 
light he seemed of gigantic size, his lowered 
head was like a granite boulder, his mighty 
withers rose behind it like a mountain of 
solid muscle. Never before had either Veda 
Kong or Darr Veter been close to an animal 
that 
possessed 
malicious, 
death-dealing 
strength and whose unthinking brain was 
deaf to the voice of reason. 

Veda pressed her hands tightly to her 
bosom and stood stock still, as though hypno-
tized by the vision that appeared suddenly 
out of the darkness. Darr Veter, obeying some 
powerful instinct, stood in front of the bull 
to protect Veda as his ancestors had done 
thousands and thousands of times before him. 
The hands of the man of the New Era, how-
ever, were empty. 

"Veda, jump to the right," he just managed 
to say as the bull plunged at them. In their 
rapidity of action the well-trained bodies of 
the two travellers were equal to the primeval 
agility of the bull. The giant flashed past 
them and crashed into the thicket of bushes 
and Veda and Darr found themselves in dark-
ness a few paces from the platform. Away 

from the fire the night did not seem so dark 
and Veda's dress could no doubt be seen from 
some distance. The bull extracted itself from 
the wild cherry bushes and Darr Veter heaved 
his companion towards the machine: with a 
well-performed vault she landed on the little 
platform. While the animal was turning, tear-
ing up the ground with its hoofs, Darr Veter 
got on to the platform beside Veda. They 
exchanged hurried glances and in the eyes of 
his companion Darr saw nothing but frank 
admiration. He had removed the cover from 
the motor during the day when he had tried 
to find out how it worked. Mustering every 
ounce of strength, he tore the cable of the 
balancing field from the rail of the platform, 
put one end under the spring of the accumu-
lator terminal and pushed Veda protectively 
to one side. In the meantime the bull had its 
horn under the rail and the machine was 
swaying dangerously. Darr Veter pushed the 
end of the cable into the animal's muzzle. 
There was a flash of lightning, a dull thud, 
and the savage beast collapsed in a heap. 

"Oh! You've killed it!" exclaimed Veda 
disapprovingly. 

"I don't think so, the ground's dry!" ex-
claimed the ingenious hero with a smirk of 
satisfaction. As though in confirmation of his 
words the bull grunted feebly, got to its 
feet and, without looking round, staggered off 
at a trot from the scene of its disgrace. The 
travellers returned to their fire and another 
armful of twigs gave new life to the dying 
embers. 

' I don't feel the cold any more/' said Ve-
da, "let's climb the hill." 

The top of the hill hid the lipht of the fire 
from them and the pale stars of the northern 
summer formed balls of mist on the horizon. 

There was nothing to be seen in the west; 
in the north, rows of lights, faintly discer-
nible, flickered on the slopes of some hills; in 
the south burned the bright star of a herds' 
men's watch tower 
also a long way off. 

"Too bad. we'll have to walk all night," 
muttered Darr Veter. 

"No, look over there!" Veda pointed to the 
east where four lights, placed in the form of a 
square, had flashed on suddenly. They were 
only a couDle of miles away. Taking note of 
the direction by the stars they returned to 
the fire. Veda Kong stopped for a while be-
fore the dying embers as thouqh trying to re-
member something. 

"Farewell to our home," she said contem-
platively. "The nomaris probably had such 
homes as this all the time, uncertain and 
short-lived. Today ! have become a woman of 
that epoch." 

She turned to Darr Veter and put her arm 
trustingly round his neck 

"I felt the need for protection so strongly! 
i was not afraid, it wasn't that, but there was 
some sort of tempting submission to fate ... 
or so it seems." 

Veda placed her hands 
behind her head 
and stretched herself gracefully before the 
fire. A second later her dimming eyes had 
again acquired their -oguish sparkle. 

"All right, lead the way ... hero!" and the 
tone of her deep voice became gentle and 
filled with unfathomable mystery. 

The bright night was full of the perfumes 
of grasses, the rustling of small animals and 
the cries of night birds. Veda and Darr walked 
cautiously, afraid of falling into some unseen 
hole or crack in the dry earth. The brush-
headed grass stalks stealthily grazed their 
ankles. Darr Veter looked around vigilantly 
'.vhenever they came in sight of dark clusters 
of bushes. 

Veda laughed softly. 
"Perhaps we should have taken the accu-
mulator and cable with us?" 

"You're thoughtless, Veda," said Darr Ve-
ter 
good-humouredly, 
"more 
so 
than 
I 
thought!" 

The young woman suddenly became se-
rious. 

"I felt your protection too strongly..." And 
Veda began to speak, or rather, to think aloud, 
about further plans for the work of her expe-
dition. The first stage of the work at the grave 
mounds in the steppes was finished and her 
workers had returned to their old employ-
ments or were seeking something new. Darr 
Veter, however, had not chosen another job 
and was free to follow the woman he loved, 
gauging by reports that reached them Mven 
Mass's work was going well. Even if he had 
Ourit badly the Council would not have ap-
pointed Darr Veter again so soon. In the 
Cirea: 0:rcle Era i+ was not "-hoLght advisable

>nt j o u I i;3 

most valuable possession of man, his creative 
inspiration, grew weaker and he could only 
return to an old job after a long break. 

"Doesn't our work seem petty and mono-
tonous to you after six years' communion 
with the Cosmos?" 

Veda's 
clear 
and attentive glance was 
fixed on him. 

"This isn't petty or monotonous work," 
he objected, "but it certainly doesn't provide 
me with that tension to which I am accus-
tomed. I need the strain, otherwise I'll be-
come too calm and good-natured, as though I 
were being treated with blue sleep!" 

"Blue sleep..." began Veda and the catch in 
her breath told Darr Veter more than the 
burning cheeks that he could not see in the 
dark. 

" I ' m 
going to continue my exploration 
farther to the south," she said, interrupting 
herself, "but not until I have gathered a new 
group of volunteer diggers. Until then I am 
going to take part in the maritime excava-
tion, I have been asked to help there." 

Darr Veter understood her and his heart 
beat faster with joy. A second later, however, 
he had hidden his feelings in a distant corner 
of his heart and hurried to Veda's help. 

"Do you mean the excavation of the sub-
marine city to the south of Sicily?" he asked. 
"I saw some wonderful things from there in 
the Atlantis Palace." 

"No, not there, we're working along the 
coasts of the Eastern Mediterranean, the Red 
Sea and off the Indian coast now. We are 

looking for cultural treasures under the water, 
beginning from the Creto-lndian period and 
ending with the Dark Ages." 

"You mean what was hidden or, more of-
ten, simply thrown into the sea when the 
islands of civilization were destroyed under 
the impact of new forces, fresh, barbaric, ig-
norant and reckless—that is something I can 
understand," said Darr Veter thoughtfully, his 
eyes carefully studying the whitish plain. " I 
can also understand the great destruction of 
ancient civilizations, when the states of anti-
quity, strong in their bonds with nature, were 
unable to make changes in their world, to 
cope with the growing horror of slavery and 
the parasitic upper strata of society." 

"And people exchanged the primitive ma-
terialism that had led them into a blind alley 
for 
the 
religious darkness of the 
Middle 
Ages," added Veda, "but what is there that 
you cannot understand?" 

"It's just that I have a very poor idea of the 
Creto-lndian civilization." 

"You don't know the latest researches. 
Traces of that civilization are now being 
found over a huge area from Africa, through 
Crete, the southern part of Central Asia, 
Northern India to Western China." 

" I did not suspect that in those ancient 
days there could have been secret treasure-
houses for works of art like those of Cartha-
go, Greece and Rome." 

"Come with me and you'll see," said Veda, 
softly. Darr Veter walked beside her in si-
lence. They were ascending a long, gentle slope 

and had reached the ridge when Dc-r Veter 
suddenly stopped. 

"Thanks for your offer, I'll come." 
Veda turned her head towards him some-
what mistrustfully but in the half-iight of the 
northern night her companion's eyes were 
dark and impenetrable. 

Once past the ridge the lights turned out to 
be quite close. Lamps in polarizing hoods did 
not disperse the light rays and that made 
them seem farther away than they really 
were. Such concentrated light was a sign of 
night work and this was confirmed by a low 
roar that increased in volume as thev neared 
it. Huge latticed trusses shone like silver under 
blue lamps high up in the air; a warning howl 
of sirens brought them to a standstill as the 
protective robots began working. 

"Danger, keep to the left, don't approach 
the line of posts!" shouted the loudspeaker 
of an invisible amplifier. They turned obe-
diently towards a group of white portable 
houses. 

"Don't look in the direction of the field!" 
the robot continued warning them. 

The door of two houses opened simulta-
neously and two beams of light crossed on the 
dark road. A group of men and women gave 
the travellers a hearty welcome but were 
surprised at the imperfect means of transport 
that had brought them there, especially at 
night. 

The cupboard-like cabin of the shower 
bath with its streams of aromatic water satu-
rated with gas and electricity with the merry 

play of tiny electric charges on the skin, was 
a place that gave gentle pleasure. 

Refreshed, the travellers 
met at table. 

"Veter, my dear, we've come across some 
of our colleagues!" exclaimed Veda, freshly 
bathed and extremely young, as she poured 
out a golden liquid. 

"The ten tonics, right now!" he exclaimea, 
reaching for his glass. 

"Bullfighter, you're growing savage in the 
steppes," protested Veda. "I'm telling you in-
teresting news and you only think of eating!" 

"Are there excavations here?" said Darr 
Veter, doubtingly. 

"There are, only they're palaeontological, 
not archaeological. They're studying the fos-
silized animals of the Permian period, two 
hundred 
million 
years old. That puts us 
in the shade with our petty 
thousands.'' 

"Are they studying them in the ground, 
without 
digging them 
up? 
How's 
that?" 

"Yes, in the ground, although as yet I don't 
know how." 

One of those sitting at the table, a thin, 
yellow-faced man, joined in the conversation. 

"Our group is now relieving another. We 
have just finished preparations and are about 
to start work on depth photography." 

"Hard irradiation," hazarded Darr Veter. 
"If you are not too tired I would advise 
you to watch it. Tomorrow we shall be mov-
ing the whole apparatus to another site and 
that will not be interesting." 

Veda and Dart 
gladly consented. Their 
nuspitabie iiosts rose from the table and led 

them into a neighbouring house, where pro-
tective clothing hung in niches with a clock-
face indicator over each of them. 

"There is very great ionization from our 
powerful electron tubes," said a tall, slightly 
round-shouldered woman with a faint sugges-
tion of apology as she helped Veda into a 
suit of closely-woven fabric and a transparent 
helmet, and fastened a container with batte-
ries on her back. In the polarized light every 
hillock in the steppes stood out with unna-
tural clarity. A dull groan came from a square 
space marked off by thin rails. The earth 
heaved, cracked and opened up in a crater in 
the centre of which appeared a sharp-nosed 
silver cylinder. Its polished walls were en-
circled by a spiral ridge and the sharp end was 
fitted with an intricate electric milling head of 
blue metal rotating as the machine appeared. 
The cylinder rolled over the edge of the cra-
ter, turned over, showed blades that moved 
quickly at the rear end and began digging in 
again a few metres away from the crater, 
diving almost vertically with its polished nose 
into the ground. 

Darr Veter noticed a double cable that the 
cylinder pulled behind it, one of the cables 
was insulated, the other made of some highly-
polished metal. Veda jerked his sleeve and 
pointed in front of them, beyond the fence of 
magnesium rails. A second cylinder, similar to 
the first, had come out of the earth, with 
just the same movements had rolled over to 
the left and disappeared as though it had 
dived into water. 

The yellow-faced man made a sign to his 
visitors to hurry. 

"I remember now who he is," whispered 
Veda, as they hastened to overtake the group 
ahead of them, "he is Liao Lang, the palaeon-
tologist who discovered the secret of the set-
tlement of the Asian continent in the Palaeo-
zoic." 

"Is he of Chinese origin?" asked Darr Ve-
ter, recalling the sombre glance of the scien-
tist's slightly slant eyes. "I'm ashamed to ad-
mit it, but I don't know anything about his 
work." 

" I see you don't know much about our 
terrestrial 
palaeontology," 
Veda remarked. 
"You probably know more about that of 
other stellar worlds." 

Before Darr's mind's eye there passed the 
countless forms of life, millions of strange 
skeletons in the rocks of various planets, mo-
numents to the past hidden in the different 
strata of all inhabited world. This was nature's 
memory, recorded by her until such times as 
a reasoning being appeared, a being not only 
capable of remembering but also of restor-
ing that which had been forgotten. 

They went on to a small platform fixed to 
the end of a half-arch of lattice-work. In the 
centre of the floor there was a big, unlighted 
screen with low benches around it on which 
the visitors sat and waited. 

"The 'moles' will finish soon," said Liao 
Lang. "As you have probably guessed they are 
carrying the bare wire through the rocks 
and weaving a metallic net. The skeletons of 

extinct animals lie in friable sandstone at a 
depth of fourteen metres below the surface. 
Lower, seventeen metres, the whole field 
is covered by the metallic net which is con-
nected to powerful inductors. A field of ref-
lection is thus created which throws X-rays 
on to the screen giving us the image of the 
fossilized bones." 

Two big metal globes turned on massive 
pedestals. Floodlights were switched on and 
the 
howl of sirens warned everybody of 
danger. Direct current at a tension of a mil-
lion volts filled the air with the fresh smell of 
ozone and made the terminals and insulators 
glow blue in the dark. 

Liao 
Lang 
was 
turning 
switches 
and 
pressing buttons on the control panel with 
feigned carelessness. The big screen grew 
brighter and brighter, in its depths some faint, 
blurred outlines appeared here and there in 
the field of vision. All 
movement on the 
screen then ceased, the fluid outlines of a 
big patch became clear-cut and filled almost 
the whole screen. 

After a few more manipulations on the 
control panel the onlookers saw before them 
the skeleton of an unknown animal showing 
through a hazy glow. The wide paws with 
their long claws were bent under the body, 
the long tail was curled in a loop. An outstand-
ing feature of the skeleton was the unusual 
thickness of the huge bones with curved ends 
and ridges to which the animal's 
mighty 
muscles had been attached. The skull with 
jaws clamped tight was grinning with 
its 

front teeth. It was seen from above and looked 
like a bone slab with a rough, broken sur-
face. Liao Lang changed the depth of focus 
and the degree of enlargement until the whole 
screen was filled with the head of the ancient 
reptile that had lived two hundred million 
years before on the banks of a river that had 
once flowed there. 

The top of the skull consisted of extraordi-
narily thick—no less than twenty centimet-
res—plates of bone. There were bony ridges 
over the eye-sockets and there were similar 
excrescences over the temporal hollows and 
on the convex bones of the skull. From the 
back part of the skull there rose a big cone 
with the opening of a tremendous parietal 
eye. Liao Lang gave a loud gasp of admira-
ration. 

Darr Veter could not take his eyes off the 
clumsy, heavy skeleton of the ancient beast 
that had 
been compelled to live as the pri-
soner of unresolved contradictions. Increases 
in muscular power had led to thicker bones 
that were put to great strain, and the heavier 
weight of the bigger bones again required a 
strengthening of 
the muscles. This direct 
dependence 
led the evolution 
of 
archaic 
organisms into a complete deadlock until 
some 
important 
physiological 
mutation 
resolved the old contradictions and brought 
about a new evolutionary stage. It seemed 
unbelievable that such creatures were amongst 
the ancestors of man with his beautiful body 
apable of great activity and precise move-
ments. 

Darr Veter looked at the excrescences over 
the 
brows 
of 
the 
Permian 
reptile 
that 
betrayed its stupid ferocity and compared it 
with lithe, supple Veda with such bright eyes 
in her intelligent, lively face. What a tremen-
dous difference in the organization of living 
matter! 
Involuntarily he squinted sideways, 
trying to get a glimpse of Veda's features 
through her helmet and when his eyes re-
turned to the screen there was something else 
there. This was the wide, flat, parabolic head 
of an amphibian, the ancient salamander, 
doomed to lie in the warm, dark waters of a 
Permian swamp, waiting until something eat-
able came within its reach. Then, one swift 
leap, one snap of the jaws and again the same 
eternal, patient and senseless lying in wait. 
Darr Veter felt annoyed and oppressed by 
pictures of the endlessly long and cruel evolu-
tion of life. He straightened up and Liao 
Lang, guessing his mood, suggested that they 
return home to rest. It was hard for Veda, 
with her insatiable curiosity, to tear herself 
away from her observations until she saw 
that the scientists were hurrying to switch 
on the machines to take electron photographs 
and to make sound-recordings so as not to 
waste power. 

Veda was soon ensconced on a wide divan 
in the drawing-room of the women's hostel 
but Darr Veter remained for some little time 
walking up and down the smooth terrace in 
front of the house, mentally reviewing his 
impressions. 

The dew of the northern morning washed 

the previous day's dust off the grass. The 
imperturbable Liao Lang returned from his 
night's work and proposed sending his guests 
to the nearest aerodrome on an Elf, a small 
accumulator-driven car. There was a base for 
jumping jet aircraft a hundred kilometres to 
the south-east, on the lower reaches of the 
River Trom-Yugan. Veda wanted to get in 
touch with her expedition but there was no 
radio transmitter of sufficient power at the 
dig. Since our ancestors discovered the harm-
ful influence of radioactivity and introduced 
strict regulation into the use of radio, directed 
radio communication has required much more 
complicated apparatus, especially for long-dis-
tance conversations. In addition to that the 
number of stations has been greatly reduced. 
Liao Lang decided to get in touch with the nea-
rest herdsmen's watch-tower. These watch-to-
wers had radio intercommunication and could 
also communicate directly with the centre of 
the district. A young girl student who proposed 
driving the Elf in order to bring it back, 
suggested calling in at a watch-tower on the 
way so that the visitors could use the tele-
visophone for their conversation. Darr Veter 
and Veda were glad of the opportunity. A 
strong wind blew the occasional wisps of dust 
away from them and ruffled the abundant, 
short-cropped hair of their driver. There was 
scarcely room for the three of them in the 
narrow car, Darr Veter's huge body made it 
a tight fit for the two women. The slim sil-
houette of the watch-tower was visible in the 
distance against the clear blue of the sky. 

- 1 0 0 6 

Very soon the Elf came to a standstill at the 
foot of the tower. A plastic roof was built 
between the straddling legs of the structure 
where another Elf was garaged. The guide 
bars of a tiny lift led up through this roof 
and took them one by one past the living 
quarters to the platform at the top of the 
tower where they were met by an almost 
naked young man. The sudden confusion 
displayed by their hitherto self-reliant driver 
gave Veda to understand that the reason 
for her having been so accommodating was 
a deep-rooted one. 

The 
circular 
room 
with 
crystal 
walls 
swayed noticeably and the metal structure of 
the tower thrummed monotonously like a 
taut violin string. The floor and ceiling of the 
room were painted in dark colours. On the 
narrow curved tables under the windows there 
were 
binoculars, calculating machines and 
notebooks. The tower, from its height of 
ninety metres, had a full view of the surround-
ing steppe as far as the limits of visibility of 
neighbouring towers. The staff maintained 
constant watch over the herds and kept re-
cords of fodder supplies. The milking laby-
rinths, through which the herds of milch 
cows were driven twice a day, lay in the 
steppe in green concentric rings. The milk 
which, like that of the African antelope, did 
not turn sour, was poured into containers and 
frozen on the spot after which it could be 
kept for a long time 
in the underground 
refrigerators. The herds were driven from one 
pasture to another with the aid of the Elfs 

kept at each of the watch-towers. The obser-
vers were mostly young people who had not 
completed their education and they had plen-
ty of time to study during their tour of duty. 
The young man led Veda and Darr Veter 
down a spiral staircase to living quarters 
suspended between the supports of the tower 
a few yards below the platform. The rooms 
were equipped with sound insulation and the 
travellers 
found 
themselves 
in 
absolute 
silence. Only the constant swaying of the 
room served to remind them that they were at 
a height that could be dangerous in the event 
of the slightest carelessness. 

Another youth was working at the radio. 
The 
exotic 
hair-do and 
brightly-coloured 
dress of the girl in the televisophone screen 
showed that he was talking to the central 
station; women working in the steppes wore 
short overall suits. The girl on the screen 
connected them with the zonal station and 
soon the sad face and tiny figure of Miyiko 
Eigoro, Veda's chief assistant, appeared on 
the screen. There was pleasurable astonish-
ment in her slightly slant eyes, like those of 
Liao Lang, and her tiny mouth opened at 
the suddenness of it all. A second later, 
however, Veda Kong and Darr Veter were 
confronted with a passionless face that ex-
pressed nothing except business-like atten-
tion. Darr Veter went back upstairs and found 
the girl student of palaeontology engaged in a 
lively 
conversation 
with 
the first 
youth; 
Veter went 
outside 
on 
to the 
verandah 
surrounding the circular room. The damp of 

early morning had long since given way to a 
noonday heat that robbed the colours of their 
freshness and levelled out irregularities in 
the ground. The steppe spread far and wide, 
under a burning clear sky. Veter again recalled 
his vague longing for the northern land of 
his ancestors. Leaning on the rail of the sway-
ing platform he could feel how the dreams of 
ancient peoples were coming true, and feel 
it with greater strength than ever before. 
Stern nature had been driven to the far north 
by the conquering hand of man and the vi-
talizing warmth of the south had been poured 
over these great plains that had formerly 
lain frozen under a cold, cloudy sky. 

Veda Kong entered the round room and 
announced that the radio operator had agreed 
to take them farther on their journey. The 
girl with the cropped hair thanked the his-
torian with a long glance. Through the transpa-
rent wall they could see the broad back of Darr 
Veter, as he stood there lost in contemplation. 

"Perhaps you were thinking of me?" he 
heard a voice say behind his back. 

"No, Veda, I was thinking of one of the 
postulates of ancient Indian philosophy. It 
was to the effect that the world is not made 
for man and that man himself becomes great 
only when he understands the value and beau-
ty of another life, the life of nature." 

"That idea seems incomplete and I don't 
understand it." 

"I suppose I didn't finish it. I should 
have added that man alone can understand 
not only the beauty but also the dark and 

difficult sides of life. Only man possesses the 
ability to dream and the strength to make 
life better!" 

"Now I understand," said Veda, softly, and 
after a long pause added, "you've changed, 
Veter." 

"Of course, I've changed. Four months 
of digging with a simple spade amongst the 
stones and rotting logs of your kurgans is 
enough to change anybody. Like it or not, 
you begin to look at life more simply and 
its simple joys 
become 
dearer to 
you." 

"Don't make a joke of it, Veter, I'm talking 
seriously," said Veda with a frown. "When I 
first knew you, you had command over all 
the power of Earth, and used to speak to dis-
tant worlds; in your observatories in those 
days, you might well have been the superna-
tural being whom the ancients called God. 
And here, at our simple work, where you are 
the equal of everybody else, you have..." 
Veda stopped. 

"What have I done?" he insisted, his curiosi-
ty aroused. "Have I lost my majesty? What 
would you have said if you'd seen me before 
I joined the Institute of Astrophysics? When 
I was an engine driver on the Spiral Way? 
That is still less majestic. Or a mechanic on 
the fruit-gathering machines in the tropics?" 

Veda laughed loudly. 
"I'll disclose to you a secret of my youth. 
When I was in the Third Cycle School I fell in 
love with an engine driver on the Spiral Way 
and at that time I could not imagine anybody 
with greater power... but here comes the radio 

operator. Come along, Veter." 

Before the pilot would allow Veda Kong 
and Darr Veter to enter the cabin of the jump-
ing jet aircraft he asked for a second time 
whether the health of the passengers could 
stand the great acceleration of the machine. 
He stuck strictly to the rules. When he was as-
sured that it would be safe he seated them in 
deep chairs in the transparent nose of an air-
craft shaped like a huge raindrop. Veda felt 
very uncomfortable, the seat sloped a long 
way back because the nose of the aircraft 
was raised high above the ground. The signal 
gong sounded, a powerful catapult hurled the 
plane almost vertically into the air and Veda 
sank slowly into her chair as she would in 
some viscous liquid. Darr Veter, with an 
effort, turned his head to give Veda a smile of 
encouragement. The pilot switched on the 
engine. There was a roar, a feeling of great 
weight in the entire body and the drop-shaped 
aircraft was on its course, describing an arc at 
an altitude of twenty-three thousand metres. 
It seemed that only a few minutes had passed 
when the travellers, their knees trembling 
under them, got out of the plane in front of 
their houses in the Altai steppes and the pilot 
was waving to them to get out of the way. 
Darr Veter realized that the engines would 
have to be started on the ground as there was 
no catapult there to propel the machine. 
He ran as fast as he could, pulling Veda after 
him. Miyiko Eigoro, running easily, came to 
meet them and the two women embraced as 
though they had been parted for a long time. 

Chapter Five 

THE HORSE O N T H E S E A B E D 

The warm, transparent sea lay tranquil with 
scarcely a movement of its amazingly bright 
green-blue waves. Darr Veter went in slowly 
until the water reached his neck and spread 
his arms widely in an effort to keep his foot-
ing on the sloping seabed. As he looked over 
the barely perceptible ripples towards the daz-
zling distant expanses he again felt that he 
was dissolving in the sea, that he was becom-
ing part of that boundless element. He had 
brought his long-suppressed sorrow with him, 
to the sea—the sorrow of his parting from the 
entrancing majesty of the Cosmos, from the 
boundless ocean of knowledge and thought, 
from the terrific concentration of every day 
of his life as Director of the Outer Stations. 
His existence had become quite different. 

His growing love for Veda Kong relieved days 
of unaccustomed labour and the sorrowful 
liberty of thought experienced by his superb-
ly trained brain. He had plunged into histo-
rical investigations with the enthusiasm of a 
disciple. The river of time, reflected in his 
thoughts, helped him withstand the change 
in his life. He was grateful to Veda Kong 
for having, with the sympathy and under-
standing so typical of her, arranged the fly-
ing platform trips to parts of the world that 
had been transformed by man's efforts. His 
own losses seemed petty when confronted 
with the magnificence of man's labour on 
Earth and the greatness of the sea. Darr 
Veter had become reconciled to the irrepar-
able, something that is always most difficult 
for a man. 

A soft, almost childish voice called to him. 
He recognized Miyiko, waved his arms, lay 
on his back and waited for the girl. She 
rushed into the sea, big drops of water fell 
from her stiff, black hair and her yellow-
wish body took on a greenish tinge under a 
thin coating of water. They swam side by side 
towards the sun, to an isolated desert island 
that formed a black mound about a thousand 
yards from the shore. In the Great Circle Era 
all children were brought up beside the sea 
and were good swimmers and Darr Veter, 
furthermore, possessed natural abilities. At 
first he swam slowly, afraid that 
Miyiko 
would grow tired, but the girl slipped along 
beside him easily and untroubled. Darr Veter 
increased his speed, surprised at her skill. 

Even when he exerted himself to the full she 
did not drop behind and her pretty immobile 
face remained as calm as ever. They could 
soon hear the dull splash of water on the 
seaward side of the islet. Darr Veter turned 
on to his back, the girl swam past him, de-
scribed a circle and returned to him. 

"Miyiko, you're a marvellous swimmer!" 
he exclaimed in admiration. He filled his 
lungs with air and checked his breathing. 

"My swimming isn't as good as my diving," 
the girl replied, and Darr Veter was again as-
tonished. 

" I am Japanese by descent," she explained. 
"Long ago there was a whole tribe of our 
people, the women of which were all divers; 
they dived for pearls and gathered edible 
seaweeds. This trade was passed on from gene-
ration to generation and in the course of 
thousands of years it developed into a won-
derful art. Quite by accident it is manifested 
in me today, when there is no longer a 
separate Japanese people, language or count-
ry." 

"I never suspected..." 
"That a distant descendant of women div-
ers would become an historian? In our tribe 
we had a legend. There was once a Japanese 
artist by the name of Yanagihara Eigoro." 

"Eigoro? Isn't that your name?" 
"Yes, it is rare in our days, when people 
are named any combination of sounds that 
pleases the ear. Of course, everybody tries 
to find combinations from the languages of 
their ancestors. 
If I'm not mistaken your 

name consists of roots from the Russian 
language, doesn't it?" 

"They 
aren't 
roots 
but 
whole 
words, 
Darr meaning 'gift'and Veter meaning 'wind'." 

"I don't know what my name means. But 
there really was an artist of that name. One 
of my ancestors found a picture of his in 
some repository. It is a big canvas, you can 
take a look at it in my house, it will be inter-
esting for an historian. A stern and coura-
geous life is depicted with extreme vividness, 
all the poverty and unpretentiousness of a 
nation in the clutches of a cruel regime... 
Shall we swim farther?" 

"Wait a minute, Miyiko. What about the 
women divers?" 

"The artist fell in love with a diver and 
settled amongst that tribe for the rest of his 
life. His daughters, too, became divers who 
spent their lives at their trade in the sea. Look 
at that peculiar islet over there, it's like a 
round tank, or a low tower, like those they 
make sugar in." 

"Sugar!" snorted Darr Veter, involuntarily. 
"When I was a boy these desert islands fasci-
nated me. They stand alone, surrounded by 
the sea, their dark cliffs or clumps of trees 
hide 
mysterious secrets, you 
could meet 
with everything imaginable on them, anything 
you dreamed of." 

Miyiko's jolly laugh was his reward. The 
girl, usually so reticent and always a little 
sad, had now changed beyond recognition. 
She sped on merrily and bravely towards the 
heavily breaking waves and was still a mystery 

to Veter, a closed door, so different from 
lucid 
Veda whose 
fearlessness was 
more 
magnificent 
trustfulness 
than 
real 
persist-
ence. 

Between the big offshore rocks the sea 
formed deep galleries into which the sun pe-
netrated to the very bottom. These galleries, 
on whose bed lay dark mounds of sponges 
and whose walls were festooned with sea-
weeds, led to the dark, unfathomed depths 
on the eastern side of the island. Veter was 
sorry that he had not taken an accurate chart 
of the coastline from Veda. The rafts of the 
maritime expedition gleamed in the sun at 
their moorings on the western spit several 
miles from their island. Opposite them was an 
excellent beach and Veda was there now with 
all 
her 
party; 
accumulators 
were 
being 
charged in the machines and the expedition 
had a day-off. Veter had succumbed to the 
childish pleasure of exploring 
uninhabited 
islands. 

A grim andesite cliff hung over the swim-
mers; there were fresh fractures where a 
recent earthquake had brought down 
the 
more eroded part of the coast. There was a 
very steep slope on the side of the open sea. 
Miyiko and Veter swam for a long time in the 
dark water along the eastern side of the island 
before they found a flat stone ledge on to 
which Veter hoisted Miyiko who then pulled 
him up. 

The startled sea birds darted back and 
forth and the crash of the waves, transmitted 
by the rocks, made the andesite mass tremble. 

There was nothing on the islet but bare stone 
and a few tough bushes, not a sign anywhere 
of man or beast. 

The swimmers made their way to the top 
of the islet, looked at the waves breaking 
below and returned to the coast. A bitter 
aroma came from the bushes growing in 
the crevices. Darr Veter stretched himself 
out on a warm stone, and gazed lazily into 
the 
water 
on the southern side of 
the 
ledge. 

Miyiko was squatting at the very edge of 
the cliff trying to get a better view of some-
thing far down below. At this point there 
were no coastal shallows or piled-up rocks. 
The steep cliff hung over dark, oily water. 
The sunshine produced 
a glittering band 
along the edge of the cliff, and down below, 
where the cliff diverted the sunlight verti-
cally into the water, the level seabed of light- • 
coloured sand was just visible. 

"What can you see there, Miyiko?" 
The girl was deep in thought and did not 
turn round immediately. 

"Nothing much. You're attracted to de-
sert islands and I to the seabed. It seems to 
me that 
you can always find something 
interesting on the seabed, make some discov-
ery." 

"Then why are you working in the step-
pes?" 

"There's a reason for it. The sea gives me 
so much pleasure that I cannot stay with 
it all the time. You cannot always be listen-
ing to your favourite music and it is the same 

with me and the sea. Being away for a time 
makes every meeting with the sea more pre-
cious." 

Darr Veter nodded his agreement. 
"Shall we dive down there?" he asked, 
pointing to a gleam of white in the depths. 
In her astonishment Miyiko raised brows that 
already had a natural slant. 

"D'you think you can? It must be about 
twenty-five metres deep there, it takes an 
experienced diver." 

"I'll try. And you?" 
Instead of answering him Miyiko got up, 
looked round until she found a suitable big 
stone which she took to the edge of the 
cliff. 

"Let me try first. I'll go down with a 
stone although it's against my rules, but 
the floor is very clean, I'm afraid there may 
be a current lower down." 

The girl raised her arms, bent forward, 
straightened up and then bent backwards. 
Darr Veter watched her at her breathing 
exercises, trying to memorize them. Miyiko 
did not say another word but, after a few 
more exercises, seized hold of the stone and 
dived into the dark water. 

Darr Veter felt a vague anxiety when more 
than a minute passed and the bold girl did not 
reappear. He, too, began looking for a stone, 
assuming that he would need one much big-
ger. He had just taken hold of an eighty-
pound lump of andesite when Miyiko came 
to the surface. The girl was breathing heavily 
and seemed fatigued. 

"There," she gasped, "there's a horse." 
"What? What horse?" 
" A huge statue of a horse, down there, in a 
natural niche. I'm going back to take a pro-
per look." 

"Miyiko, it's too difficult for you. Let's 
swim back to the beach and get diving gear 
and a boat." 

"Oh, no. I want to look at it myself, now! 
Then it will be my own achievement, not 
something done by a machine. We'll call the 
others afterwards." 

"All right, I'm coming with you!" Darr 
Veter seized his big stone and the girl laughed. 

"Take a smaller one, that one will do. And 
what about your breathing?" 

Darr Veter obediently performed the neces-
sary exercises and then dived into the water 
with the stone in his hands. The water struck 
him in the face and turned him with his back 
to Miyiko; something was squeezing his chest 
and there was a dull pain in his ears. He 
clenched his teeth, strained every muscle in 
his body to fight against the pain. The pleas-
ant light of day was rapidly lost as he entered 
the cold grey gloom of the depths. The 
cold, hostile power of the deep water momen-
tarily overpowered him, his head was in a 
whirl, there was a stinging pain in his eyes. 
Suddenly Miyiko's firm hand seized him by 
the shoulder and his feet touched the firm, 
dully silvery sand. With difficulty he turned 
his head in the direction she indicated; he 
staggered, dropped the stone in his surprise 
and shot immediately upwards. He did not 

remember how he got to the surface, he could 
see nothing but a red mist and his breathing 
was spasmodic. In a short time the effects 
of the high pressure wore off and that which 
he had seen was reborn in his memory. He 
had seen the picture for an instant only but 
his eyes had seen and his brain recorded 
many details. 

The dark cliffs formed a lofty lancet arch 
under which stood the gigantic statue of a 
horse. Neither seaweeds nor barnacles marred 
the polished surface of the carving. 

The unknown sculptor had endeavoured 
mainly to depict strength. The fore part of 
the body was exaggerated, the tremendous 
chest given abnormal width and the neck 
sharply curved. The near foreleg was raised 
so that the rounded knee-cap was thrust 
straight at the viewer while the massive hoof 
almost touched the breast. The other three 
legs were strained in an effort to lift the ani-
mal from the ground, giving the impression 
that the giant horse was hanging over the 
viewer to crush him with its fabulous strength. 
The mane on the arched neck was depicted 
as a toothed ridge, the jowl almost touched 
the breast and there was ominous malice in 
its eyes that looked out from under the 
lowered brow and in the stone monster's 
pressed-back ears. 

Miyiko was soon satisfied that Darr Veter 
was unharmed, left him stretched out on a 
flat stone slab and dived once again into the 
water. At last the girl had worn herself out 
with her deep diving and had seen enough of 

her treasure. She sat down beside Veter and 
did not speak until her breathing had again 
become normal. 

"I wonder how old that statue can be?" 
Miyiko asked herself thoughtfully. 

Darr Veter shrugged his shoulders and then 
suddenly remembered the most astonishing 
thing about the horse. 

"Why is there no seaweeds or barnacles 
on the statue?" 

Miyiko turned swiftly towards him. 
"Oh, I've seen such things before. They 
were covered with some special lacquer that 
does not permit living things to attach them-
selves to it. That means that the statue must 
belong approximately to the Fission Age." 

A swimmer appeared in the sea between 
the shore and the island. As he drew near he 
half rose out of the water and waved to them. 
Darr Veter recognized the broad shoulders 
and gleaming dark skin of Mven Mass. The tall 
black figure was soon ensconced on the 
stones and a good-natured smile spread over 
the face of the new Director of the Outer 
Stations. He bowed swiftly to little Miyiko 
and with an expansive gesture greeted Darr 
Veter. 

"Renn Bose and I have come here for one 
day to ask your advice." 

"Who is Renn Bose?" 
" A physicist from the Academy of the 
Bounds of Knowledge." 

"I think I've heard of him, he works on 
space-field relationship problems, doesn't he? 
Where did you leave him?" 

"On shore. He doesn't swim, not as well 
as you, anyway." 

A 
faint splash 
interrupted Mven Mass. 

"I'm going to the beach, to Veda," Miyiko 
called out to them from the water. Darr Ve-
ter smiled tenderly at the girl. 

"She's going back with a discovery," he 
explained to Mven Mass and told him about 
the finding of the submarine horse. The 
African 
listened but showed no interest. 
His long fingers were fidgeting and fumbling 
at his chin. In the gaze he fixed on Darr 
Veter the 
latter 
read anxiety and hope. 

"Is there anything serious worrying you? 
If so, why put it off?" 

Mven Mass was not loath to accept the 
invitation. Seated on the edge of a cliff over 
the watery depths that hid the mysterious 
horse he spoke of his vexatious waverings. 
His meeting with Renn Bose had been no 
accident. The vision of the beautiful world 
known as Epsilon Tucanae had never left 
him. Ever since that night he had dreamed of 
approaching this wonderful world, of over-
coming, in some way, the great space separat-
ing him from it, of doing something so that 
the time required to send a message there and 
receive an 
answer would not be six hundred 
years, a period much greater than a man's 
lifetime. He dreamed of experiencing at first 
hand the heartbeat of that wonderful life 
that was so much like our own, of stretching 
out his hand across the gulf of the Cosmos to 
our brothers in space. Mven Mass concentrat-
ed his efforts on putting himself abreast of 

unsolved problems and unfinished experi-
ments that had been going on for thousands 
of years for the purpose of understanding 
space as a function of matter. He thought of 
the problem Veda Kong had dreamed of 
on the night of her first broadcast to the 
Great Circle. 

In the Academy of the Bounds of Knowl-
edge, Renn Bose, a young specialist in ma-
thematical physics, was in charge of these 
researches. His meeting with Mven Mass and 
their subsequent friendship was determined 
by a similarity of endeavour. 

Renn Bose was by that time of the opinion 
that the problem had been advanced suffi-
ciently to permit of an experiment, but it 
was one that could not be done at laboratory 
level, like everything else Cosmic in scale. 
The colossal nature of the problem made a 
colossal experiment necessary. Renn Bose 
had come to the conclusion that the experi-
ment should 
be carried out through the 
outer stations with the employment of all 
terrestrial power resources, including the Q-
energy station in the Antarctic. 

A sense of danger came to Darr Veter when 
he looked into Mven's burning eyes and at 
his quivering nostrils. 

"Do you want to know what I should do?" 
He 
asked 
this 
decisive 
question 
calmly. 

Mven Mass nodded and passed his tongue 
over his dry lips. 

"I 
should 
not 
make the 
experiment," 
said Darr Veter, carefully stressing every word 
and paying no attention to the grimace of 

pain that flashed across the African's face 
so swiftly that a less observant man would 
not have noticed it. 

"That's what 
I expected!" Mven Mass 
burst out. 

"Then why did you consider my advice 
to have any importance?" 

" I thought we should be able to convince 
you." 

"All right, then, try! We'll swim back to 
the others. They're probably getting diving 
apparatus 
ready 
to 
examine the 
horse!" 

Veda was singing and two other women's 
voices were accompanying her. 

When 
she 
noticed 
the 
swimmers 
she 
beckoned to them, motioning with the fin-
gers of her open hand like a child. The singing 
stopped. Darr Veter recognized one of the 
women as Evda Nahl, although this was the 
first time he had seen her without her white 
doctor's smock. Her tall, pliant figure stood 
out amongst the others on account of her 
white, still untanned skin. The famous woman 
psychiatrist had apparently been busy and 
had not had time for sunbathing. Evda's 
blue-black hair, divided into two by a dead 
straight parting, was drawn up high above 
her temples. High cheek-bones over slightly 
hollow cheeks served to stress the length of 
her piercing black eyes. Her face bore an 
elusive resemblance to an ancient Egyptian 
sphinx, the one that in very ancient days 
stood at the desert's edge beside the pyramid 
tombs of the kings of the world's oldest 
state. The deserts have been irrigated for 

many centuries, the sands are dotted with 
groves of rustling fruit-trees and the sphinx it-
self still stands there under a transparent 
plastic shade that does not hide the hollows 
of its time-eaten face. 

Darr Veter recalled that Evda Nahl's genea-
logy went back to the ancient Peruvians or 
Chileans. He greeted her in the manner of 
the ancient sun worshippers of South America. 

" I t has done you good to work with the 
historians," said Evda, "thank Veda for that." 
Darr Veter hurriedly turned to his friend Ve-
da, but she took him by the hand and led 
him to a woman with whom he was not 
acquainted. 

"This is Chara Nandi! All of us here are 
guests of hers and Cart Sann's, the artist, 
you know they have been living on this coast 
for a month already. They have a portable 
studio at the other end of the bay." 

Darr Veter held out his hand to the young 
woman who looked at him with huge blue 
eyes. For a moment his breath was taken 
away, there was something about the woman 
that distinguished her from all others, some-
thing that was not mere beauty. She was 
standing between Veda Kong and Evda Nahl 
whose natural beauty was refined, as it were, 
by exceptional intellect and the discipline 
of lengthy research work but which never-
theless faded before the extraordinary power 
of the beautiful that emanated from this 
woman who was a stranger to him. 

"Your name has some sort of resemblance 
to mine," began Darr Veter. 

The corners of her tiny mouth quivered as 
she suppressed a smile. 

"Just as you yourself are like me!" 
Darr Veter looked over the top of the mass 
of her thick, slightly wavy black hair that 
came level with his shoulder and smiled 
expansively at Veda. 

"Veter, 
you 
don't 
know 
how 
to 
pay 
compliments to the ladies," said Veda, coy-
ly holding her head on one side. 

"Does one have to know the deception 
that is no longer needed?" 

"One does," Evda Nahl put in, "and the 
need for it will never die out!" 

"I'd be glad if you'd explain what you 
mean," said Darr Veter, knitting his brows. 

"In a month from now I shall be giving 
the autumn lecture at the Academy of Sorrow 
and Joy, and it will contain a lot about 
spontaneous emotions, 
but in the mean-
time..." Evda nodded to Mven Mass who was 
approaching them. 

The African, as usual, was walking noise-
lessly and with measured tread. Darr Veter 
noticed that the tan on Chara's cheeks be-
came tinged with ruddy as though the sun 
that had permeated her body were bursting 
out through her tanned skin. Mven Mass 
bowed indifferently. 

"I'll bring Renn Bose here, he's sitting 
over there on a rock." 

"We'll all go to him," suggested Veda, 
"and on the way we'll meet Miyiko. She's 
gone for the diving apparatus. Chara Nandi, 
are you coming with us?" 

The girl shook her head. 
"Here comes my master. The sun has gone 
down and work will soon begin." 

"Posing must be hard work," said Veda, 
"it's 
a real deed of valour! 
I couldn't." 

" I thought I couldn't do it, either. But if 
the artist's idea attracts you, you enter into 
the creative work. You seek an incarnation 
of the image in your own body, there are 
thousands of shades in every movement, in 
every curve! You have to catch them like 
musical notes before they fly away." 

"Chara, you're a real find for an artist!" 
" A find!" A deep bass voice interrupted 
Veda. "And if you only knew how I found 
her! It's unbelievable!" 

Artist Cart Sann raised a big fist high in the 
air and shook it. His straw-coloured hair 
was tousled by the wind, his weather-beaten 
face was brick-red and his strong hairy legs 
sank into the sand as though they were grow-
ing there. 

"Come along with us, if you have time," 
asked Veda, "and tell us the story." 

"I'm not much of a story-teller. But still, 
it's an amusing tale. I'm interested in recon-
structions, especially in the reconstruction of 
various racial types such as existed in ancient 
days, right up to the Era of Disunity. After 
my picture Daughter of Gondwana met with 
such success I was burning with ambition to 
reincarnate another racial type. The beauty of 
the human body is the best expression of 
race after generations of clean, healthy life. 
Every race in the past had its detailed formu-

las, its canons of beauty that had been 
evolved in days of savagery. That is the way 
we artists understand it, we who are con-
sidered to be lagging behind in the storm of 
the heights of culture. Artists always did 
think that way, probably from the days of the 
palaeolithic cave painter. But I'm getting off 
the track... I had planned another picture, 
Daughter 
of 
Thetis, 
of the 
Mediterranean, 
that is. It struck me that the myths of ancient 
Greece, Crete, Mesopotamia, America, Poly-
nesia, all told of gods coming out of the 
sea. What could be more wonderful than 
the Hellenic myth of Aphrodite, the goddess 
of love and beauty. The very name, Aphrodite 
Anadiomene, the Foam-Born, she who rose 
from the sea... A goddess, born of foam and 
conceived by the lights of the stars in the 
nocturnal sea—what people ever invented a 
legend more poetic..." 

"From 
starlight 
and 
sea-foam," 
Veda 
heard Chara whisper. She cast a side glance at 
the girl. Her strong profile, like a carving from 
wood or stone, was like that of some woman 
of an ancient race. The small, straight, slight-
ly rounded nose, the somewhat sloping fore-
head, the strong chin and most important of 
all, the great distance from the nose to the 
high ear—all these features typical of the 
Mediterranean peoples at the time of anti-
quity were reflected in Chara's face. 

Unobtrusively 
Veda examined her from 
head to foot and thought that everything in 
her was just a little "too much". Her skin 
was too smooth, her waist too narrow, her 

hips too wide. And she held herself too 
straight so that her firm bosom became too 
prominent. Perhaps that was what the artist 
wanted, strongly defined lines? 

A stone ridge crossed their path and Veda 
had to correct the impression she had only 
just received: Chara Nandi jumped from boul-
der to boulder with an unusual agility, as 
though she were dancing. 

"She must have Indian blood in her," 
decided Veda. "I'll ask her later on." 

" M y w o r k on the Daughter 
of Thetis," 
the 
artist continued, "brought me closer to the 
sea, I had to get a feeling for the sea since my 
Maid of Crete, like Aphrodite, would arise 
from the waves and in such a manner that 
everybody would understand it. When I was 
preparing to paint the Daughter 
of Gond-
wana I spent three years at a forestry station 
in Equatorial Africa. When that picture was 
finished I took a job as mechanic on a hydro-
plane carrying mail around the Atlantic—you 
know, to all those fisheries and protein and 
salt works afloat on big metal rafts in the 
ocean. 

"One evening I was driving along in the 
Central Atlantic, somewhere to the west of 
Azores where the northern current and the 
counter-current meet. There are always big 
waves there, rollers that come one after 
another. My hydroplane rose and fell, one 
moment almost touching the low clouds and 
next minute diving deep into the trough 
between the rollers. The screw raced as it 
came out of the water. I was standing on the 

high bridge beside the helmsman. And sud-
denly... I'll never forget it! 

"Imagine a wave higher than any of the 
others that raced towards us. On the crest 
of this giant wave, right under the low ceil-
ing of rosy-pearl clouds stood a girl, sunburned 
to the colour of bronze. The wave rolled 
noiselessly on and she rode it, infinitely proud 
in her isolation in the midst of that bound-
less ocean. My boat was swept upwards and 
we passed the girl who waved us a friendly 
greeting. 
Then 
I could see that she was 
standing on a surf-board fitted with an elec-
tric motor and accumulator." 

"I know the sort," agreed Darr Veter, "it's 
intended for riding the waves." 

"What amazed me most of all was her 
complete solitude—there was nothing but low 
clouds, an ocean empty for hundreds of miles 
around, the evening twilight and the girl 
carried along on the crest of a giant wave. 
That girl..." 

"Was 
Chara 
Nandi," 
said 
Evda 
Nahl. 
"That's obvious, but where did she come 
from?" 

"She was not born of starlight and foam!" 
chuckled Chara, and her laughter had a sur-
prisingly high, resonant note to it, "merely 
from the raft of a protein factory. We were 
moored on the fringe of the Sargasso Sea 
where we were cultivating chlorella.16 I 
was working there as a biologist." 

"Be that as it may," said Cart Sann, "but 
from that moment for me you were a daugh-
ter of the Mediterranean, born of foam. You 

were fated to be the model for my future 
picture. I had been waiting a whole year." 

"May we come and look at it?" asked Veda 
Kong. 

"Please do, but not during working hours. 
You had better come in the evening. I work 
very slowly and cannot tolerate anybody's 
presence when I am painting." 

"Do you use colours?" 
"Our work has changed very little during 
the thousands of years that people have 
painted pictures. The laws of optics and the 
human eye have remained the same. We 
have become more receptive to certain tones, 
new chromokatoptric colours17 with 
inter-
nal reflexions contained in the paint layer 
have been invented, there are a few new 
methods of harmonizing colours, that's all; 
on the whole the artist of antiquity worked 
in very much the same way as I do today. 
In some respects he did better. He had confi-
dence 
and 
patience—we've 
become 
more 
dashing and less confident of ourselves. At 
time strict naivete is better for art. But I'm 
digressing again! It's time for us to go. Come 
along, Chara!" 

They all stood still and watched the artist 
and his model as they walked away. 

"Now I know who he is," murmured Veda. 
"I've 
seen 
the 
Daughter 
of 
Gondwana." 

"So have I," said Evda Nahl and Mven Mass 
together. 

"Gondwana, is that from the land of the 
Gonds in India?" asked Darr Veter. 

"No, it is the collective name for the 

southern continents. In general it is the land 
of the ancient black race." 

"And what is this Daughter of the Black 
People like?" 

" I t is a simple picture. There is a plateau, 
the fire of blinding sunlight, the fringe of a 
formidable tropical forest and in the fore-
ground, a black-skinned girl, walking alone. 
One half of her face and her firm, tangibly 
hard, cast-metal body is drenched with blaz-
ing sunlight, the other half of her is in deep, 
transparent half-shadow. A necklace of white 
animal's teeth 
hangs from her neck, her 
short hair is gathered at the crown of her 
head and covered 
with a wreath of fiery-
red blossoms. Her right arm is raised over 
her head to push aside the last branches of a 
tree that bar her way, with her left hand she 
is pushing a thorny stalk away from her knee. 
In the halted movement, in the free breath-
ing, and in the strong sweep of the arm there 
is carefree youth, young life merging with 
nature 
into 
a 
single 
whole 
that 
is as 
changeable as a river in flood... This oneness is 
to be understood as knowledge, the intuitive 
understanding of the world. In her dark eyes, 
gazing over a sea of bluish grass towards the 
faintly visible outlines of mountains, there is 
a clearly felt uneasiness, the expectation of 
great trials in the new, freshly discovered 
world!" Evda Nahl stopped. 

"But how did Cart Sann manage to convey 
the idea?" asked Veda Kong. "Perhaps it is 
in the raising of the thin eyebrows, the neck 
inclined slightly forward, the open, defence-

less back of her head... And those amazing 
eyes, filled with the dark wisdom of ancient 
nature... The strangest thing of all is that you 
feel, at the same time, carefree, dancing 
strength and alarming knowledge." 

"It's a pity I haven't seen it," said Darr 
Veter. " I must go to the Palace of History and 
take a look at it. I can imagine the colours 
but I can't imagine the girl's pose." 

"The pose?" Evda Nahl stopped, threw 
the towel from her shoulders, raised her 
right arm high over her head, leaned slightly 
backward and turned half-facing Darr Veter. 
Her long leg was slightly raised as though 
making a short step and not completing it, 
her toes just touching the ground. Her supple 
body seemed to blossom forth. They all 
stood still in frank admiration. 

"Evda, I could never have imagined you 
like that!" exclaimed Darr Veter. "You're 
dangerous. You're like the half-exposed blade 
of a dagger!" 

"Veter, those clumsy compliments again," 
laughed 
Veda, 
"why 
half 
and not 
fully 
exposed?" 

"He's 
quite 
right," 
smiled 
Evda 
Nahl, 
relaxing to her normal self, "not fully. Our 
new acquaintance, Chara Nandi, is a fully 
drawn and gleaming blade, to use the epic 
language of Darr Veter." 

"I can't believe that anybody can compare 
with you!" came a hoarse voice from amongst 
the boulders. Only then did Evda Nahl notice 
the red hair cut en brosse and the blue eyes 
that were gazing at her adoringly with a look 

such as she had never before seen on any-
body's face. 

" I am Renn Bose!" said the red-headed 
man, bashfully, as his short, narrow-shouldered 
figure 
appeared 
from 
behind a 
boulder. 

"We were looking for you," said Veda, 
taking the physicist by the hand, "this is 
Darr Veter." 

Renn Bose blushed and the freckles on his 
face and neck stood out even more prominent-
ly than before. 

"I stayed up there for some time," said 
Renn 
Bose, 
pointing 
to 
a rocky 
slope. 
"There is an ancient tomb there." 

" I t is the grave of a famous poet who 
lived a very long time ago," announced Veda. 

"There's an inscription on the tomb, here 
it is." The physicist unrolled a thin metal 
sheet with four rows of blue symbols on it. 

"Those 
are 
European 
letters, 
symbols 
that were in use before the world linear 
alphabet was introduced. They had clumsy 
shapes that were inherited from the still older 
pictograms. 
But 
I know that 
language." 

"Then read it, Veda!" 
"Be quiet for a few minutes!" she demand-
ed and they all obediently sat down on the 
rocks. Very soon Veda stood before the seat-
ed people and read her improvised transla-
tion: 

Thoughts 
and events and our dreams are 

all 
fleeting, 
Vanquished 
by time like a ship lost at 

sea... 

Leaving 
this 
world 
on my journey 
of 

journeys, 

Earth's 
dearest 
obsession 
I'm 
taking 

with 
me... 

"That's exquisite!" Evda Nahl rose to her 
knees. " A modern poet couldn't have said 
anything better about 
the power of time. 
I should like to know which of Earth's obses-
sions he thought the best and took with him 
in his last thoughts." 

"He 
no doubt 
thought of a beautiful 
woman," 
said 
Renn 
Bose, 
impetuously 
gazing at Evda Nahl. Or did she imagine 
it? 

A boat of transparent plastic containing 
two people appeared in the distance. 

"Here comes Miyiko with Sherliss, one of 
our mechanics, he goes everywhere with her. 
Oh, no," Veda corrected herself, "it's Frith 
Don himself, the Director of the Maritime 
Expedition. Good-bye, Veter, you three will 
want to stay together so I'll take Evda with 
me!" 

The two women ran down to the gentle 
waves and swam together to the island. The 
boat turned towards them but Veda waved 
to them to go on. Renn Bose, standing mo-
tionless, watched the swimmers. 

"Wake up, Renn, let's get down to busi-
ness!" Mven Mass called to him. The physi-
cist smiled in shy confusion. 

A stretch of firm sand between two ridges 
of rock was turned into a scientific auditor-
ium. Renn Bose, using fragments of seashells, 

drew and wrote in the sand, in his excitement 
he fell flat, his body rubbing out what he had 
written and drawn so that he had to draw 
it all again. Mven Mass expressed his agree-
ment or encouraged the physicist with abrupt 
exclamations. Darr Veter, resting his elbows 
on his knees, wiped away the perspiration 
that broke out on his forehead from the 
effort 
he was making to understand. 
At 
last the red-headed physicist stopped talk-
ing, and sat back on the sand breathing 
heavily. 

"Yes, Renn Bose," said Darr Veter after a 
lengthy pause, "you have made a discovery 
of outstanding importance." 

"I did not do it alone. The ancient mathe-
matician Geisenberg propounded the prin-
ciple of indefiniteness, the impossibility of 
accurately defining the position of tiny par-
ticles. The impossible has become possible 
now that we understand mutual transitions, 
that is, we know the repagular calculus.18 
At 
about the same time scientists discovered 
th*3 circular meson cloud in the atomic nuc-
|W' 
that is, they came very near to an under-
standing of anti-gravitation." 

"We'll accept that as true. I'm not a special-
ist in 
bipolar 
mathematics,19 
particularly 
the 
repagular calculus which studies 
the 
obstacles to transition. But I realize that your 
work with the shadow functions is new in 
principle, although we ordinary people cannot 
properly understand it unless we have mathe-
matical clairvoyance. I can, however, conceive 
of the tremendous significance of the discove-

ry. There is one thing..." Darr Veter hesitated. 

"What, what is there?" asked Mven Mass, 
anxiously. 

"How can we do it experimentally? I don't 
think we can create a sufficiently powerful 
electromagnetic field..." 

"To balance the gravitational field and 
obtain a state of transition?" inquired Renn 
Bose. 

"Exactly. Beyond the limits of the system, 
space will remain outside our 
influence." 

"That's true, but, as always in dialectics, 
we must look for a solution in the opposite. 
Suppose we obtain an anti-gravitational shad-
ow vectorially and not discretely." 

"Ah! But how?.." 
Swiftly, 
Renn Bose drew three straight 
lines and a narrow sector with an arc of great-
er radius intersecting them. 

"This was known before bipolar mathema-
tics. Two thousand and five hundred years 
ago it was called the Problem of the Fourth 
Dimension. In those times there was a wide-
spread conception of multidimensional space; 
the 
shadow 
properties 
of 
gravitation, 
however, were unknown and people attempt-
ed to find an analogy with electromagnetic 
fields which led them to believe that points of 
singularity meant that matter had disappeared 
or had been changed into something that 
could be named but could not be explained. 
How could they have had any conception of 
space with their limited knowledge of the 
nature 
of phenomena? 
But our ancestors 
could guess—you see, they realized that if the 

distance from, say, star A to the centre of 
Earth along line OA is twenty 
quintillion 
kilometres, then the distance to the same star 
by vector OB will equal zero ... in practice, 
not zero but approaching it. They said that 
zero time would be achieved if the velocity of 
motion were equal to the velocity of light. 
Remember that the cochlear calculus20 has 
been only recently discovered!" 

"Spiral motion was known thousands of 
years ago," Mven Mass remarked cautiously, 
interrupting the scientist. 
Renn Bose dis-
missed the remark disdainfully. 

"They knew the motion but not the laws! 
It's like this, if the gravitational field and the 
electromagnetic field are two sides of one and 
the same property of matter and if space 
is a function of gravitation, then the function 
of the electromagnetic field is anti-space. The 
transition from one to the other yields the 
vector shadow function, zero space, which 
is known in everyday language as the speed 
of light. I believe it to be possible to achieve 
zero space in any direction. Mven Mass wants 
to visit the planet of Epsilon Tucanae—it's 
all the same to me as long as I can set up the 
experiment! As long as I can set up the exper-
iment!" repeated the physicist, lowering his 
white eyelashes wearily. 

"You still need not only the outer stations 
and Earth's energy, as Mven Mass pointed out, 
but some sort of an installation as well. Such an 
installation cannot be simple or easily erected." 

"In that respect we're lucky. We can use 
Corr 
Yule's 
installation 
near the 
Tibetan 

K- lOOci 

Observatory. Experiments for the investiga-
tion of space were carried out there a hun-
dred and seventy years ago. There will have to 
be some adjustments and, as far as volunteers 
to help me are concerned, I can get five, ten, 
twenty thousand any time I like. I have only 
to call for them and they will take leave of 
absence and come." 

"You seem to have thought of everything. 
There is only one other consideration, but it 
is the most important—the danger of the ex-
periment. There may be the most unexpected 
results; in conformity with the law of big 
numbers we cannot make a preliminary at-
tempt on a small scale. We must take the 
extraterrestrial scale from the start." 

"What scientist would be afraid of risk?" 
asked 
Renn 
Bose, 
shrugging 
his 
shoul-
ders. 

"I wasn't thinking of personal risk! I know 
that there will be thousands of volunteers 
as soon as they are required for some dange-
rous and novel enterprise. The experiment 
will also involve the outer stations, the obser-
vatories, the whole system of installations 
that has cost mankind a tremendous amount 
of labour. These are installations that have 
opened a window into the Cosmos, that have 
put mankind in contact with the life, knowl-
edge and creative activity of other populated 
worlds. This window is mankind's greatest 
achievement: do you think that you, or I, or 
any other individual or group of individuals 
has the right to take the risk of closing it, 
even for a short time? I would like to know 

whether you feel that you have that right and 
on what grounds?" 

"I have, and on good grounds," said Mven 
Mass, rising to his feet. "You have been at 
archaeological excavations—do not the bil-
lions of 
unknown 
skeletons 
in 
unknown 
graves appeal to us? Do they not reproach 
us and make demands of us? I visualize 
billions of human lives that have passed, lives 
in which youth, beauty and the joy of life 
slipped away like sand through one's fingers— 
they demand that we lay bare the great mys-
tery of time, that we fight against it! Victory 
over space is victory over time, that is why 
I'm sure that I'm right, that's why I believe 
in the greatness of the proposed experi-
ment!" 

"My feelings are different," said Renn Bose. 
"But they form the other side of the same 
thing. Space still cannot be overcome in the 
Cosmos, it keeps the worlds apart and pre-
vents us from discovering planets with popu-
lations similar to ours, prevents us from 
joining them in one family that would be 
infinitely rich in its joy and strength. This 
would be the greatest transformation since 
the Era of World Unity, since the days when 
mankind finally put an end to the separate 
existence of the nations and merged into one, 
in this way making the greatest progress to-
wards a new stage in the conquest of nature. 
Every new step in this direction is more 
important than anything else, more impor-
tant than any other investigations or knowl-
edge." 

Renn 
Bose had scarcely finished when 
Mven Mass spoke again. 

"There is one other thing, a personal one. 
In my youth I had a collection of old histor-
ical novels. There was one story about your 
ancestors, Darr Veter. Some great conqueror, 
some fierce destroyer of human life of whom 
there were so many in the epochs of the lower 
forms of society, launched an attack against 
them. The story was about a strong youth 
who was madly in love. His girl was captured 
and taken away—'driven off' was the word 
used in those days. Can you imagine it? 
Men and women were bound and driven off 
to the country of the conqueror like cattle. 
The youth was separated from his beloved 
by thousands of miles. The geography of 
Earth was unknown, riding and pack animals 
were the only means of transport. The world 
of those days was more mysterious and vast, 
more dangerous and difficult to cross than 
Cosmic space is for us today. The-young hero 
hunted for his dream, for years he wan-
dered terribly dangerous paths until he found 
her in the depth of the Asian mountains. It is 
difficult to define the impression I had when 
I was younger but it still seems to me that I, 
too, could go through all the obstacles of the 
Cosmos to the one I loved!" 

Darr Veter smiled wanly. 
"I can understand your feelings but I can-
not get clear for myself what logical grounds 
there are for comparing a Russian story to 
your urge to get into the Cosmos. I under-
stand Renn Bose better. Of course, you warned 

us that this was personal..." 

Darr Veter stopped. He sat silent so long 
that Mven Mass began to fidget. 

"Now I understand why it was that people 
used to 
smoke, drink, bolster themselves 
up with drugs at moments of uncertainty, 
anxiety or loneliness. At this moment I feel 
just as alone and uncertain—I don't know 
what to say to you. Who am I to forbid a 
great experiment? 
But then, how 
can 
I 
permit it? You must turn to the Council, 
then..." 

"No, that won't do." Mven Mass stood up 
and his huge body was tensed as though 
he were 
in 
mortal 
danger. 
"Answer 
us: 
would you make the experiment? As Di-
rector of the Outer Stations, not as Renn 
Bose, he is different..." 

" N o ! " 
answered Darr Veter, firmly. 
" I 
should wait." 

"What for?" 
"The erection of an experimental installa-
tion on the Moon." 

"And power for it?" 
"The lesser gravity of the Moon and the 
smaller scale of the experiment would make 
only a few Q-stations necessary." 

"But that would take hundreds of years— 
I should never see it!" 

"You wouldn't, but as far as the human 
race is concerned it doesn't matter whether 
it's now or a generation later." 

"But it's the end for me, the end of my 
dream! And for Renn..." 

"To me it means that it's impossible to 

check up my work experimentally and make 
corrections—it 
means I cannot 
continue!" 

"One mind is not enough. Ask the Coun-
cil." 

"Your ideas and words are the Council 
decision in advance. We have nothing to 
expect from them," said Mven Mass softly. 

"You're right. The Council will refuse." 
"I shan't ask you anything else. I feel 
guilty, Renn and I have put the heavy burden 
of decision upon you." 

"That is my duty as one older in experience. 
It is not your-fault that the task seems mag-
nificent 
and 
extremely 
dangerous. 
That 
is what upsets me so much, makes it hard 
to bear." 

Renn 
Bose 
was 
the 
first 
to 
suggest 
returning to the temporary dwellings of the 
expedition. The three downcast men plodded 
through the sand, each in his own way feeling 
the bitter sorrow of having to reject an exper-
iment such as had never before been tried. 
Darr Veter cast occasional side glances at 
his companions and felt that it was harder 
for him than for them. There was a bold 
recklessness in his nature that he had had 
to fight against all his life. It made him some-
thing like an old-time brigand—why had he 
felt such joy and satisfaction in his mischie-
vous battle with the bull? In his heart he was 
indignant, he was full of protest against a 
decision that was wise but not bold. 

Chapter Six 

THE L E G E N D OF THE B L U E SUNS 

Dr. Louma Lasvy and Eon Thai, the biolo-
gist, dragged their heavy weight slowly to-
wards him from the ship's sick bay. Erg 
Noor went to meet them. 

"Nisa?" 
"Alive, but..." 
"Dying?" 
"Not yet. She is totally paralyzed. Her 
respiration is extraordinary low. Her heart is 
functioning-one beat in a hundred seconds. 
It is not death but it is an absolute collapse 
which may last a long, an indefinitely long 
time." 

"Is there any possibility that she may 
regain consciousness and suffer?" 

"None whatever." 
"Are you sure?" The look in the comman-

der's eyes was sharp and insistent, but the 
doctor was not at all put out. 

"Absolutely sure!" 
Erg Noor looked inquiringly at the biolo-
gist. He nodded his affirmation. 

"What do you intend to do?" 
"Keep her in an even temperature, absolute 
repose and weak light. If the collapse does not 
progress ... what does it matter... let her sleep 
till we reach Earth. Then she can go to the 
Institute of Nerve Currents. The injury is 
due to some form of current, her spacesuit 
was holed in three places. It is a good thing 
that she was scarcely breathing!" 

"I noticed the holes and sealed them with 
my plaster," said the biologist. 

In silent gratitude Erg Noor squeezed his 
arm above the elbow. 

"Only..." began Louma. "We'd better get 
her away from high gravitation as quickly as 
we can ... and ... at the same time there's 
danger, not so much in the acceleration of 
the take-off as in the return to normal gra-
vitation." 

"I see, you're afraid the pulse will get even 
slower. But the heart is not a pendulum that 
accelerates its oscillations in a field of high 
gravitation, is it?" 

"The rhythm of impulses in the organism, 
in general, follows the same laws. If the heart-
beats slow down to, say, one in two hundred 
seconds, 
then 
the 
brain 
will 
not 
get a 
sufficient supply of blood, and..." 

Erg Noor fell into such deep thought that 
he forgot that he was not alone: he suddenly 

came to himself and sighed deeply. 

His companions waited patiently. 
"Would it not be a way out if the organism 
were to be submitted to higher pressures in an 
atmosphere enriched with oxygen?" asked 
the commander cautiously, and by the satis-
fied smiles on the faces of Louma Lasvy and 
Eon Thai he knew that the idea was the right 
one. 

"Saturate the blood with the gas under 
increased pressure, good... Of course, we must 
take 
precautions against thrombosis 
and— 
let her heart beat once in two hundred sec-
onds, it will come right later." 

Eon's smile showed his white teeth under a 
black moustache and gave his stern face a 
look of youthfulness and reckless merriment. 

"The organism will remain paralyzed but 
will 
live," said Louma with relief. "Let's 
go and get the chamber ready. I want to use 
the big silicolloid hood that we took 
for 
Zirda. We can get a floating armchair inside 
it to make a bed for her during the take-off. 
After acceleration ceases we can make her a 
proper bed." 

"As soon as you're ready report to the 
control 
tower. 
We're 
not staying here a 
minute longer than necessary... we've had 
enough of the darkness and weight of the 
black world!" 

The crew hurried to their various sections 
of the ship, each of them struggling against 
excess weight as best he could. 

The signals for the take-off resounded like 
a song of victory. 

With feelings of such absolute relief as they 
had never before experienced the people of 
the expedition entrusted themselves to the 
soft embraces of the landing chairs. A take-
off from a heavy planet is a difficult and 
dangerous undertaking. The acceleration ne-
cessary to escape its gravity would strain the 
very limit of human endurance and the slight-
est mistake on the part of the pilot might 
lead to the death of them all. 

There was a deafening roar of the planetary 
motors as Erg Noor directed the spaceship at 
a tangent to the horizon. The levers of the 
hydraulic chairs were pressed lower and lower 
under the influence of growing weight. In a 
moment the levers would reach the limit and 
then, under the pressure of acceleration the 
frail human bones might be broken as they 
would be on an anvil. The commander's 
hands, lying on the buttons that controlled 
the ship's machinery, were unbearably heavy. 
But his strong fingers were at work and Tant-
ra, describing a huge flattened arc, rose higher 
and higher out of thick darkness into the 
transparent blackness of infinity. Erg Noor 
kept his eyes fixed on the red line of the hori-
zontal 
leveller—it 
wavered in its unstable 
equilibrium, indicating that the ship showed a 
tendency to stop its climb and travel on the 
downward arc. The heavy planet had still 
not given up its prisoner. Erg Noor decided 
to switch on the anameson motors whose 
power was sufficient to lift the spaceship 
from any planet. Their ringing vibration made 
the whole ship shudder. The red line rose 

about half an inch above the zero line. A little 
more... 

Through the upper inspection periscope the 
commander saw that Tantra was covered with 
a fine layer of blue flame that flowed slowly 
towards the stern of the vessel. The atmo-
sphere had been passed! In empty space ves-
tigial electric currents, following the law of 
superconductivity, flowed along the vessel's 
hull. 

The stars had again become needles of light 
and Tantra, escaping, flew farther and farther 
from the dread planet. The burden of gravity 
decreased with every minute. The body be-
came lighter and lighter, the artificial gravi-
tation machine began to hum and after so 
many days under the pressure of the black 
planet terrestrial gravity seemed indescribably 
small. The people jumped up from their 
chairs. Ingrid, 
Louma and Eon performed 
intricate 
passages from a fantastic 
dance. 
The inevitable reaction, however, soon set 
in and the greater part of the crew fell into a 
brief sleep that gave temporary repose. Only 
Erg Noor, Pel Lynn, Pour Hyss and Louma 
Lasvy remained awake. The spaceship's tempo-
rary course had to be worked out to avoid 
the belt of ice and meteoroids by describing 
an arc perpendicular to the plane of rotation 
of star T's system. After this the ship could 
be brought up to its normal subphotonic 
speed and work could be begun on the com-
putation of the real course. 

The doctor kept watch over Nisa's con-
dition after the take-off and the return to 

normal terrestrial gravity. She was soon able 
to reassure all those who were awake by her 
report that the pulse had reached a constant 
of one beat in a hundred and ten seconds. 
This was not mortal as long as there was an 
excess supply of oxygen. Louma Lasvy pro-
posed using a tiratron,21 an electronic car-
diac 
exciter, 
and neurosecretory 
stimula-
tors.22 

The walls of the ship whined for fifty-five 
hours from the vibration of anameson motors 
until, at last, the speedometer showed that 
they had attained a speed of nine hundred 
and 
seventy 
million 
kilometres an 
hour, 
very close to the safety limit. In the course of 
a terrestrial 24-hour day their distance from 
the iron star increased by more than 20,000 
million kilometres. It is difficult to describe 
the relief felt by all thirteen members of the 
expedition after their severe trials—the mur-
dered planet, the loss of Algrab and the awful 
black sun. The joy of liberation was not 
complete, one member of the expedition, 
young Nisa Creet, lay motionless in a special 
partition of the sick bay in a cataleptic half-
sleep and half-death. 

The five women on the ship, Ingrid, Louma, 
the second electronic engineer, the geologist, 
and lone Marr, the teacher of rhythmic gym-
nastics (who was also keeper of the food 
stores, radio operator and collector of scien-
tific material), gathered as though for an an-
cient funeral rite. Nisa's body, divested of 
all clothing and washed with the special 

solutions TM and AS, had been laid out on 
a thick hand-stitched carpet of the soft-
est Mediterranean sponges. This carpet was 
placed on a pneumatic mattress under a dome 
of 
transparent, 
rosy-hued 
silicolloid. 
An 
accurate air-condition controller would keep 
the 
necessary 
temperature, 
pressure 
and 
composition 
of 
the air 
inside the 
hood 
constant for many years. Soft rubber blocks 
kept Nisa fixed in one position which Louma 
intended to change once a month. She was 
more afraid of bed-sores than of anything 
else—they could come from absolute motion-
lessness. 
Louma, 
therefore, 
decided 
that 
a watch had to be kept over Nisa's body and 
herself refused to take her periods of long 
sleep during the first year or two of the jour-
ney. Nisa's cataleptic state continued. The 
only improvement Louma could effect was 
an increase in pulse-beats to one a minute. 
Little as this was, it was sufficient to enable 
them to stop the oxygen saturation which 
was harmful to the lungs... 

Four months passed. The spaceship was 
following its real, computed course home, 
avoiding the belt of free meteoroids. The 
crew, worn out with their adventures and 
hard toil, were sunk in a seven months' sleep. 
This time there were four instead of the three 
people awoke on board: Erg Noor and Pour 
Hyss, whose tour of duty it was, were joined 
by Louma Lasvy and Eon Thai. 

The commander, after having got out of a 
graver situation than any spaceship comman-
der had ever been in before, felt very lonely. 

The four years' journey back to Earth seemed 
endless to him. He did not deceive himself— 
they were endless because he could hope to 
save his fearless auburn-haired astronavigator, 
whom he had come to love, only on Earth. 

For a long time he put off doing what he 
would otherwise have done on the days after 
the take-off—running through the electronic 
stereofilms from Parus—he 
had wanted to 
see them together with Nisa and with her hear 
the first news from those wonderful worlds, 
the planets of the blue star of the terrestrial 
night sky. He had wanted Nisa to share with 
him the pleasure of seeing the boldest roman-
tic dreams of the past and present coming 
true—the 
discovery of 
new stellar worlds, 
the future distant islands of human civili-
zation. But at last they had to be brought 
out... 

The films had been taken at a distance of 
eight parsecs from the Sun eighty years be-
fore and, although they had been lying in 
the open ship on the black planet of star T, 
they were in excellent condition. The hemi-
spherical stereoscreen took the four mem-
bers of Tantra's 
crew back to where blue 
Vega shone high above them. 

There were many sudden changes of sub-
ject—the screen was filled by the dazzlingly 
blue star which was followed by casual, min-
ute-long pictures of life on board the ship. 
The 28-year-old commander of the expedi-
tion, unbelievably young for his post, worked 
at the computers while still younger astrono-
mers made observations. The films showed 

obligatory daily sport and dances that the 
young people had brought to acrobatic per-
fection. A mocking voice announced that the 
biologist 
had 
maintained 
the 
champion-
ship all the way to Vega. That girl with short, 
flaxen hair, was demonstrating the most dif-
ficult 
exercises twisting her 
magnificently 
developed body into all sorts of improbable 
poses. 

As they looked at the perfectly natural 
images with all the normal colour tones on 
the hemispherical screen, they forgot that 
these happy, vigorous young astronauts had 
long before been devoured by the foul mon-
sters of the black planet. 

The terse chronicle of expedition life soon 
passed. The light amplifiers in the projector 
began to hum; so brightly did the blue star 
glow that even this pale reproduction forced 
people to put on protective glasses. The star 
was almost three times our Sun in diameter 
and mass—colossal, greatly flattened and mad-
ly rotating with an equatorial speed of three 
hundred kilometres a second, a ball of indes-
cribably luminous gas with a surface tempe-
rature of 11,000°C and a corona of rosy-
pearl flame spreading millions of kilometres 
around it. It seemed as though Vega's rays 
would crush everything they met in their path 
as they thrust out their mighty million-kilo-
metre-long spears into space. The planet 
nearest to the blue star was hidden in their 
glow, but no ship from Earth or from any of 
her neighbours on the Great Circle could 
plunge into that ocean of fire. The visual 

image was followed by a vocal report on 
observations that had been made and the 
almost 
phantom 
lines 
of 
stereometric 
drawings showed the 
positions of 
Vega's 
first and second planets. Parus could not ap-
proach even the second planet whose orbit 
was a hundred million kilometres from the 
star. 

Monstrous protuberances flew out of the 
depths of an ocean of transparent violet 
flame, the stellar atmosphere, and stretched 
like all-consuming arms into space. So great 
was Vega's energy that the star emitted light 
of the strongest quanta, the violet and invisible 
parts of the spectrum. Even when human eyes 
were protected by a triple filter it aroused 
the horrible effect of an invisible but mortally 
dangerous phantom. They could see photon 
storms flashing past, those that had managed 
to 
overcome the star's gravitation. 
Their 
distant reverberations shook and tossed Parus 
dangerously. The Cosmic ray meters and in-
struments measuring other non-elastic radia-
tions refused to function. Dangerous ioniza-
tion began to increase, even inside the well-
protected ship. They could only guess at the 
extent 
of 
the furious 
radial energy that 
poured out into the emptiness of space in a 
monstrous stream. 

The commander of Parus navigated his 
ship cautiously towards the third planet—a 
big planet with but a thin layer of transparent 
atmosphere. It looked as though the fiery 
breath of the blue star had driven away the 
cover of light gases for they trailed in a 

weakly glowing tail behind the planet on her 
dark 
side. They 
recorded the 
destructive 
evaporation of fluorine, poisonous carbon 
monoxide, and the dead density of the inert 
gases—nothing terrestrial could have lived for 
a second in that atmosphere. 

The great heat of the blue sun made inert 
mineral substances active. Sharp spears, ribs, 
vertical battlemented walls of stone, red like 
fresh wounds or black like empty pits, rose 
out of the bowels of the planet. On the pla-
teaux of lava, swept 
by violent gales, there 
were fissures and abysses belching forth mol-
ten magma like streaks of blood-red fire. 

Dense clouds of ash whirled high into the 
air, blindingly blue on the illuminated side 
and impenetrably black on the dark side. 
Streaks of lightning thousands of miles long 
struck 
in all directions, evidence of 
the 
electric saturation of the dead atmosphere. 

The awful violet phantom of the huge sun, 
the black sky, half covered by the pearly 
corona, and below, on the planet, the crim-
son contrasting shadows on a wild chaos of 
rock, the fiery crevices, cracks and circles, 
the constant flashes of green lightning—all 
this had been picked up by the stereoteles-
copes and the electron films had recorded it 
with unimpassioned, inhuman precision. 

Behind 
the machines, however, were the 
emotions of the travellers, the protest of rea-
son against the senseless power of destruction 
and the piling up of dead matter, the con-
sciousness of the hostility of the world of fu-
rious Cosmic fire. The four viewers, hypno-

tized by the sight, exchanged glances of 
approval when a voice announced that Parus 
would move on to the fourth planet. 

The human selection of events reduced the 
time factor and in a few seconds the outer 
planet of Vega appeared under the spaceship's 
keel telescopes; in size it was comparable with 
Earth. Parus descended sharply, the crew had 
evidently decided to explore the last planet in 
the hope that they would find a world, if not 
beautiful, then at least fit to bear life. 

Erg Noor caught himself mentally repeat-
ing those words—"at least". Most likely those 
who navigated Parus had similar ideas as they 
studied the planet's surface through their 
telescopes. 

" A t least"—with those two syllables they 
bade farewell to the dream of the beautiful 
worlds of Vega, of the discovery of gemlike 
planets on the far side of outer space for the 
sake of which people of Earth had voluntari-
ly agreed to forty-five years of imprisonment 
in a spaceship. 

Carried away by the pictures passing before 
his eyes, Erg Noor did not think of that im-
mediately. In the depths of the hemispherical 
screen he raced over the surface of the fan-
tastically distant planet. To the great grief 
of the travellers, of those who were dead and 
those still living, the planet turned out to be 
like our nearest neighbour in the solar system, 
the planet Mars, which they had known since 
childhood. The same thin envelope of trans-
parent gas with a blackish-green, permanent-
ly cloudless sky, the same level surface of 

desert 
continents 
with 
chains of 
eroded 
mountains. The difference was that on Mars 
there 
was a searing cold night and very 
sharp changes in the daytime temperature. 
There were shallow swamps on Mars, like 
huge 
puddles, that had evaporated 
until 
they were almost dry, there were rare and 
scanty rains and hoarfrosts, faint life in the 
form of gangrenous plants and peculiar apa-
thetic burrowing animals. 

Here, however, the raging flames of the 
blue sun kept the temperature of the planet 
so high that it breathed heat like Earth's 
hottest deserts. What little vapour there was 
rose to the upper layer of the atmosphere 
and huge plains were overshadowed by vor-
tices of hot currents in the constantly dis-
turbed atmosphere. The planet rotated at high 
speed, like the others. The cold of night had 
broken the rocks up into a sea of sand; 
orange, violet, green, bluish or 
dazzlingly 
white patches of sand drowned parts of the 
planet that from a distance had the appear-
ance of seas of imaginary vegetation. The 
chains of eroded mountains, higher than those 
on Mars but just as lifeless, were covered with 
a shining black or brown crust. The blue sun, 
with its powerful ultraviolet radiation, had 
destroyed the minerals and evaporated the 
lighter elements. 

It seemed that the light, sandy plains were 
radiating flames. Erg Noor recalled that at 
the time when only a small part and not the 
majority 
of 
Earth's 
population had been 
scientists, many artists and writers had dreamed 

of people on other planets who had adapt-
ed themselves to life at high temperatures. 
It was a poetic and beautiful notion, it in-
creased faith in the power of the human 
race—people on the fire-breathing planets of 
the blue sun meeting their terrestrial breth-
ren! Erg Noor, like many others, had been 
impressed by a picture he had seen in the 
museum of the eastern sector of the southern 
zone: a hazy horizon on a plain of crimson 
sand, a grey, burning-hot sky and under it 
faceless human figures in temperature suits 
throwing blue-black shadows of improbably 
clear definition. They stood at the corner of 
some metal structure that was at white heat 
in dynamic poses that showed their amaze-
ment. Beside the structure stood an undraped 
female figure with her red hair hanging loose. 
Her light-coloured skin gleamed more bright-
ly than the sand in the glaring light, blue and 
vermillion shadows stressed every line of her 
tall and graceful figure, the symbol of the 
victory of beautiful life over the forces of 
the Cosmos. Beautiful, that was the most 
important thing of all. For even the adap-
tation of animal life that reduced it to a form-
less devourer with but a faint spark of life in 
it, might be termed a victory. 

It was a bold and quite unreal dream that 
contradicted the laws of biological develop-
ment, laws that were far better known in the 
Great Circle Era than they had been when 
the picture was painted. 

Erg Noor gave a shudder as the surface of 
the planet rushed towards him. The unknown 

pilot of Parus was bringing his ship down. 
Sand cones, black cliffs, deposits of some 
shining green crystals flashed past. The space-
ship was flying in a regular spiral round the 
planet from pole to pole. There was not a 
sign of water or at least of the most primitive 
vegetable life. Again that "at least"— how 
accommodating 
the 
human 
mind 
could 
be! 

Then came the nostalgia of 
loneliness, 
the feeling that the ship was lost in the dead 
distance, was in the power of the flaming 
blue star. Erg Noor could feel the hopes of 
those who took the film, who were watch-
ing the planet, could feel them as though 
they were his own. If there had only been at 
least the remains of some past life! 
How 
well known is this thought to all those who 
have flown to dead planets without water or 
atmosphere, who have searched in vain for 
ruins, 
for 
the 
remains 
of 
towns 
and 
buildings in the accidental shapes of the crev-
ices, in the details of the lifeless rocks and in 
the precipices of mountains that had never 
known life. 

The earth of that distant world, scorched, 
churned up by violent storms, without any 
trace of a shadow, flashed swiftly across the 
screen. Erg Noor, recognizing the collapse 
of an ancient dream, strove to imagine how 
such an incorrect conception of the planets 
of the blue sun could have arisen. 

"Our 
terrestrial brothers will be disap-
pointed when they know this," said the biolo-
gist, softly, moving closer to the commander. 

"For many thousands of years millions of 
people on Earth have gazed at Vega. On 
summer evenings in the north all 
young 
people, all those who loved and dreamed, 
turned their eyes to the sky. In the summer 
Vega, bright and blue, stands almost in the 
zenith, how could one not admire it? Many 
centuries ago people knew quite a lot about 
the stars. But by some strange freak 
of 
thought they did not suspect that almost 
every slowly-rotating star with a strong mag-
netic field had its planets in the same way as 
almost all planets have their satellites. They 
did not know of this law but when they 
were overtaken 
by 
bitter 
loneliness they 
dreamed of fellow-beings in other worlds, 
and, more than elsewhere, on Vega, the blue 
sun. I remember translations from some of 
the ancient languages of beautiful 
poems 
about semi-divine people from the blue star..." 

"I dreamed about Vega after the Parus 
communication," confessed Erg Noor, turning 
to Eon Thai, "and in the hope that my dream 
would come true I read my own meaning in 
that communication. 
Today it is obvious 
that thousands of years of longing for dis-
tant, 
beautiful 
worlds 
have impaired 
my 
vision and that of many clever and serious 
people." 

"How do you understand the Parus com-
munication now?" 

"Quite simply. 'Vega's four planets are 
quite lifeless. Nothing more beautiful than 
our 
Earth, 
what 
happiness 
to 
return.' " 

"You're 
right!" exclaimed the biologist. 

"Why didn't we think of it before?" 

"Perhaps somebody did, but not we astro-
nauts and not the Council. That is to our 
honour—bold dreams and not sceptical dis-
appointment bring victory in life." 

The flight round the planet, as shown on 
the screen, was over. It was followed by the 
records 
made 
by the robot 
station 
that 
had 
been put out to study surface conditions on 
the planet. Next came a loud explosion as the 
geological bomb 2 3 was dropped. The huge 
cloud of mineral dust thrown up by the bomb 
explosion reached the keel of the spaceship 
where powerful suction pumps drew samples 
into the filtering side-channels of the vessel. 
Several samples of mineral dust from the 
sands and mountains of the scorched planet 
were 
put 
into 
silicolloid 
test-tubes 
and 
samples of the upper layers of the atmosphere 
were put into quartz containers. Parus set 
off on its long journey back home, a journey 
it was not fated to finish. Now the terrestrial 
sister ship of Parus was carrying back to the 
people of 
Earth everything that the lost 
travellers had won at the cost of such patient 
endeavour. 

The remaining records—six reels of obser-
vations—were 
to 
be specially 
studied 
by 
Earth's astronomers and the most 
impor-
tant details broadcast round the Great Circle. 

Nobody wanted to see the films about the 
later history of Parus, the hard struggle to 
repair the damaged ship and the battle with 
star T; nobody wanted to hear the last sound 
spool as their own experiences were still 

too fresh. They decided to leave the exami-
nation of the remainder until the time came 
for the whole crew to be awakened. Leav-
ing the commander alone in the control 
tower the others went away for a brief rest. 

Erg Noor's dreams had collapsed and he 
no longer thought of them. He tried to es-
timate the value of those few pitiful crumbs 
of knowledge the two expeditions, his and 
Parus's, would bring back to mankind at 
such terrific cost. Or did they seem pitiful 
only 
on 
account of 
his 
disappointment? 

For the first time Erg Noor began to think 
of beautiful Earth as an inexhaustible trea-
sure-house of refined, cultured human beings 
who had an insatiable thirst for knowledge 
now that they had been relieved of the ter-
rible worries and dangers that nature and 
primitive society had inflicted them with. 
The sufferings of the past, the searchings and 
failures, the mistakes and disappointments 
still remained in the Great Circle Era but 
they had been carried to a loftier plane of 
creative activity in science, art and building. 
Knowledge and creative labour had freed 
Earth from hunger, over-population, infec-
tious 
diseases 
and harmful 
animals. 
The 
world no longer had to fear the exhaustion 
of fuel and useful chemical elements, pre-
mature death and debility had been eliminat-
ed. Those crumbs of knowledge that Tantra 
would bring home would also be a contri-
bution to the mighty stream of knowledge 
that made for constant progress in the organi-
zation of society and the study of nature. 

Erg Noor opened the safe that housed 
Tantra's 
records and took out the box con-
taining the piece of metal from the spiral 
spaceship on the black planet. The heavy 
piece of sky-blue metal lay flat on his palm. 
Although he had put off the analysis of this 
precious sample for the huge laboratories 
on Earth, he knew that neither on Earth nor 
on any of the planets of the solar system 
or neighbouring stars was any such metal 
to be found. The Universe was made up of 
similar simple elements that had long before 
been systematized in the Mendeleyev Table. 
Consequently no new element—no 
metal-
could be discovered, but in the processes of 
the creation of elements, natural or artificial, 
countless isotope variations, possessing vastly 
different physical properties, could emerge. 
Then again, directed recrystallization changed 
the properties of elements to a great extent. 
Erg Noor was convinced that this piece of 
the hull of a spaceship from worlds inconceiv-
ably far away was, essentially, a terrestrial 
metal 
whose atoms had been completely 
rearranged. This would be something, perhaps 
the most important thing after news of Zir-
da's ruin, that he would take back to Earth 
and the Great Circle. 

The iron star was very close to Earth and 
a visit to its planet by a specially prepared 
expedition would not now, after the experi-
ence of Parus and Tantra, 
be particularly 
dangerous, no matter what multitude of black 
crosses and medusae there might be in that 
eternal darkness. They had been unfortunate 

in their opening of the spiral spaceship. If 
they had had time to ponder over the thing 
they would have realized then that the gi-
gantic spiral tube was part of the spaceship's 
propulsion system. 

In his mind the commander went over the 
events of that fateful last day. He remem-
bered Nisa spread over him like a shield after 
he had fallen unconscious near the monster. 
Youthful emotions that combined the he-
roic loyalty of the ancient women of Earth 
and the frank and wise courage of the modern 
world had not had time to develop in her to 
the full... 

Pour Hyss appeared silently from behind 
him to relieve the commander at his post. 
Erg Noor went through the library-laboratory 
but did not go on to the central dormitory 
cabin; instead he opened the heavy sick-bay 
door. 

The diffused light of an earthly day was 
reflected 
from 
the 
silicolloid 
cupboards 
containing 
drugs 
and 
instruments, 
from 
the X-ray, artificial respiration and blood-
circulation apparatus. He drew back a heavy 
curtain that reached up to the ceiling and 
entered the semi-darkness of the sick-room. 
The faint illumination, like moonlight, ac-
quired warmth in the rosy crystal of the sili-
colloid. Two tiratron stimulators were kept 
permanently switched on in case of sudden 
collapse; they clicked away almost sound-
lessly, keeping the paralyzed patient's heart 
beating. 
In the rosy-silver light inside the 
hood 
Nisa was stretched 
out 
motionless 

and it seemed as though she were sunk in calm, 
sweet slumber. A hundred generations of the 
healthy, clean and full life of her ancestors 
had produced the strong and supple lines of 
the female body that approached the acme of 
artistic perfection—the most beautiful crea-
tion of Earth's powerful life. 

Everything moves and develops in a spiral 
and Erg Noor could see in his imagination 
that magnificent spiral of the common as-
cent as applied to life and to human society. 
Only now did he realize with surprising clarity 
that the more difficult the conditions for the 
life and work of organisms as biological 
machines, the harder the path of social de-
velopment, the tighter the spiral is twisted 
and the closer to each other are its turns, 
the slower the process and more standardized 
and similar are the forms that emerge. By the 
laws of dialectics, however, the more imper-
ceptible the ascent, the more stable is that 
which has been achieved. 

He had been wrong in his pursuit of the 
wonderful planets of the blue sun and he had 
been teaching Nisa wrongly! They should not 
fly to new worlds in search of some unin-
habited planets that chance made suitable 
for life, but man should advance deliberate-
ly, step by step, through his own arm of the 
Galaxy in a triumphal march of knowledge 
and the beauty of life. Such as Nisa... 

In a sudden burst of deep sorrow Erg 
Noor dropped to his knees in front of the as-
tronavigator's 
silicolloid 
sarcophagus. 
The 
girl's breathing was not perceptible, her eye-

lashes cast blue shadows on her cheeks and 
her white teeth were just visible through her 
slightly parted lips. On her left shoulder, at 
the base of her neck and near the elbow 
there 
were pale, bluish marks—the places 
where the injurious currents had struck her. 

"Can you see me, do you remember any-
thing in your sleep?" asked Erg Noor in 
agony, in an outburst of grief; he felt his own 
will-power becoming softer than wax, it was 
difficult for him to breathe and there was a 
catch in his throat. The commander strained 
his interlocked fingers until 
they 
turned 
blue in his effort to transmit his thoughts to 
Nisa, to make her hear his impassioned call 
to life and happiness. But the girl with the au-
burn curls lay as immobile as a statue of pink 
marble carved to perfection from a living 
model. 

Dr. Louma Lasvy entered the sick bay soft-
ly and sensed the presence of somebody else 
in the silent room. Cautiously withdrawing 
the curtain she saw the kneeling figure of the 
commander as motionless as a memorial to 
the millions of men who have mourned their 
loved ones. This was not the first time she 
had found 
Erg Noor there and her heart 
was moved with pity for him. He rose gloomi-
ly to his feet. Louma went over to him 
and whispered in anxious tones: 

" I want to speak to you." 
Erg Noor nodded and went out, blinking 
as he entered the lighted part of the sick bay. 
He did not sit down on the chair Louma of-
fered him but remained leaning against the 

upright 
of a mushroom-shaped 
irradiation 
apparatus. Louma Lasvy stood up in front of 
him to her full, but not very great, height, 
trying to make herself look taller and more 
important for the impending talk. The com-
mander's look gave her no time for prepara-
tions. 

"You know," she began uncertainly, "that 
present-day neurology has discovered the pro-
cess by which emotions emerge in the con-
scious and subconscious 
divisions of 
the 
psyche. The subconscious yields to the in-
fluence 
of 
inhibiting 
drugs 
administered 
through the ancient spheres of the brain that 
control the chemical regulation of the orga-
nism, including the nervous system and, to 
some 
extent, 
higher 
nervous 
activity..." 

Erg Noor raised his brows. Louma Lasvy 
felt that she was speaking in too great detail 
and too long. 

" I want to say that medicine is able to 
affect those brain centres that control the 
strong emotions. I could..." 

Understanding flashed up in Erg Noor's 
eyes and developed into a slight smile. 

"You propose affecting my love for Nisa 
and relieving me of suffering?" he asked 
brusquely. 

The doctor nodded in affirmation, afraid 
to spoil the tenderness of her sympathy with 
words that would inevitably be schematic. 

Erg Noor stretched out his hand gratefully 
but shook his head in refusal. 

"I would not give up the wealth of my 
emotions, no matter how much suffering 

they cause me. Suffering, so long as it is not 
beyond 
one's 
strength, 
leads 
to 
under-
standing, understanding leads to love and the 
circle is complete. You're very kind, Louma, 
but it isn't necessary!" 

And the commander disappeared through 
the door with his usual swift gait. 

Hurrying, as they would have done in an 
emergency, the electronic and mechanical 
engineers erected the televisophone screen for 
the 
reception of 
terrestrial 
transmissions. 
After thirteen years the screen was being 
erected in the library of the central control 
tower as the ship was now in a zone where ra-
dio waves, dispersed by Earth's atmosphere, 
could be received. 

The voices, sounds, forms and colours of 
their native Earth cheered the travellers up 
and also served to increase their impatience— 
the great length of the Cosmic journey was 
becoming intolerable. 

The spaceship sent out a call to Artificial 
Earth Satellite No. 57 on the usual wavelength 
used for long-distance Cosmic journeys and 
impatiently 
awaited an answer from this 
powerful station that served as a link be-
tween Earth and the Cosmos. 

At last the call signals from the spaceship 
reached Earth. 

The whole crew of the ship were awake 
and did not leave the receivers. They were 
returning to life after thirteen terrestrial or 
nine dependent years in which there had 
been no contact with their native planet! 

They listened eagerly to reports from Earth, 
and they took part in the discussion of impor-
tant questions raised on the world radio net-
work by anybody who wished to do so. 

Quite by chance they picked up a proposal 
from the soil scientist Heb Uhr that gave 
them material for a six-weeks' discussion and 
very intricate calculations. 

"Discuss Heb Uhr's proposal!" thundered 
the voice of Earth. "Let everybody who is 
working in that field, who has any similar 
ideas or objections, say his word!" 

This, the usual formula, had a pleasant 
sound for the travellers. Heb Uhr had pro-
posed to the Astronautical Council a plan for 
the systematic exploration of the reachable 
planets of the blue and green stars. He be-
lieved these to be special worlds with extraor-
dinary strong power emanations that might 
chemically stimulate mineral compounds that 
are inert under terrestrial conditions to strug-
gle against entropy, that is, give them life. 
Special forms of life from minerals that are 
heavier than gas would be active in high tem-
peratures and in the intense radiation of 
stars in the higher spectral classes. Heb Uhr 
was of the opinion that the failure of the 
Sirius expedition, the failure to find 
life 
there, was to be expected since that rapidly 
rotating star was a binary that did not possess 
a powerful magnetic field. Nobody disputed 
with 
Heb Uhr the fact that binary stars 
could not be regarded as the originators of 
planetary systems in the Cosmos, but the 
essence of the proposal called forth very 

lively opposition from Tantra's crew. 

The astronomers, headed by Erg Noor, 
compiled a report which was transmitted 
as being the opinion of the first people who 
had seen Vega in the film taken by Parus. 

People on Earth listened with delight and 
admiration to the voice from the approaching 
spaceship. 

Tantra opposed the dispatch of the expedi-
tions suggested by Heb Uhr. The blue stars 
really did emanate tremendous energy per 
unit of their planets' surfaces, sufficient to 
ensure the life of heavy compounds. Any 
living organism, however, was at once both 
an energy filter and a dam which, in its 
struggle against the Second Law of Thermo-
dynamics, functioned only by means of the 
creation of a complex, by means of the 
great complication of simple mineral and gas 
molecules. Such complicated structures could 
only occur in a process of tremendously 
active development, which, in turn, entailed 
the lengthy stability of physical conditions. 
Stable conditions did not exist on the planets 
of 
high-temperature 
stars 
which 
rapidly 
destroyed complicated compounds in bursts 
and vortices of powerful radiation. Nothing 
there could exist for long despite the fact 
that minerals acquired the most stable crystal 
structure with a cubic atomic pattern. 

Tantra was of the opinion that Heb Uhr 
was merely repeating the one-sided assertions 
of the ancient astronomers who had not 
understood the dynamics of planet develop-
ment. Every planet lost the lighter substances 

that 
were 
carried 
away 
into space 
and 
dispersed. The loss of light elements was espe-
cially great in cases where there was great 
heat and great light pressure from the blue 
suns. 

Tantra gave a long string of examples and 
concluded that the process of "increasing 
weight" on the planets of the blue stars did 
not permit the emergence of living forms. 

Satellite 
57 transmitted 
Tantra's 
objec-
tions direct to the Council observatory. 

At last the moment came that Ingrid Dietra 
and Kay Bear, like all other members of the 
expedition, had been awaiting so impatiently. 
Tantra began to reduce her speed from her 
subphotonic velocity, had passed the ice belt 
of the solar system and was approaching the 
spaceship 
station on Triton. High velocity 
was no longer 
necessary: 
travelling at a 
speed of 900 million kilometres an hour, they 
would have reached Earth from Neptune's 
satellite, Triton, in less than five hours. The 
acceleration of the spaceship, however, took 
so long that she would have overshot the Sun 
and travelled far away from it into space if 
she had set out from Triton. 

In order to economize the precious aname-
son and save the ship from carrying unwieldy 
equipment, communications inside the solar 
system were effected by ion 
planetships. 
Their speed did not exceed 80,000 kilometres 
an hour for the inner planets and 2,500,000 ki-
lometres an hour for the most distant outer 
planets. The usual trip from 
Neptune 
to 
Earth took two and a half to three months. 

Triton was a very big satellite, only a little 
smaller 
than huge third and fourth satellites 
of Jupiter, Ganymede and Callisto, or the 
planet Mercury. It therefore possessed a thin 
atmosphere consisting mainly of nitrogen and 
carbon monoxide. 

Erg Noor 
landed the spaceship at the 
appointed place at the satellite's pole, far 
from the broad domes of the station buildings. 
On a ledge of the plateau, near a cliff that 
was honeycombed 
with underground pre-
mises, stood the gleaming glass building of 
the quarantine sanatorium. Here the travel-
lers were subjected to a five-week quarantine 
in complete isolation from all other people. 
In the course of this time skilled doctors 
would study their bodies to make sure that 
no new infection had taken root. The danger 
was too great to be ignored: every person 
who had landed on another planet, even on 
an uninhabited one, had to submit to this 
inspection no matter how long he had after-
wards been confined to the spaceship. The 
interior of the ship itself was also inspected 
by 
the sanatorium's scientists before the 
station gave permission for the journey to 
Earth. Those planets that had been studied 
long before and had been colonized by man, 
such as Venus and Mars, as well as some of 
the 
asteroids, 
had 
their 
own 
quarantine 
stations where travellers were examined be-
fore the ships left. 

Confinement in the sanatorium was easier 
than in the spaceship. There were laborato-
ries in which to work, concert halls, combined 

baths using electric currents, music, water 
and wave oscillations, daily walks in light 
protective suits in the hills near the sanato-
rium, and, lastly, there was contact with 
Earth, not always regular, but, still, Earth 
was only five hours away! 

Nisa's silicolloid sarcophagus was carried in-
to the sanatorium with every possible pre-
caution. Erg Noor and the biologist Eon 
Thai were the last to leave Tantra. 
They 
moved easily even though wearing weights 
to prevent their making sudden leaps in the 
low gravitation on the satellite. 

The floodlights around the landing fields 
were extinguished. Triton was moving across 
Neptune's daylight side. Dull as the greyish 
light reflected by Neptune was, the giant 
mirror of the planet, only 350,000 kilometres 
away from Triton, dispelled the gloom and 
gave the satellite a bright twilight like that of 
a spring evening in the northern latitudes of 
Earth. Triton revolved about Neptune in the 
opposite direction to the planet's revolution, 
that is, from east to west, once in about six 
terrestrial days so that the "daytime" twilight 
lasted about seventy hours. In that time 
Neptune revolved about its own axis four 
times and at the moment of their arrival the 
shadow of the satellite was noticeable as it 
crossed the nebulous disc. 

Almost simultaneously the commander and 
the biologist noticed a small ship standing 
near the edge of the plateau. This was not a 
spaceship with its stern half broader than 
the bows and with high stabilizer ribs. Judging 

by the sharp bows and slim hull it must have 
been a planetship but its contours differed 
in the thick ring at the stern and the long, 
distaff-shaped structure on top. 

"There's another ship here in quarantine?" 
half asked, half asserted Eon. "Can the Coun-
cil have changed its rules?" 

"Not to send out stellar expeditions before 
a previous one had returned?" asked Erg 
Noor in his turn. "We have kept to our sche-
dule but the report we should have sent to 
Earth from Zirda was two years late." 

"Perhaps it is an expedition to Neptune," 
suggested the biologist. They soon covered 
the two kilometres to the sanatorium and 
climbed up to a wide terrace faced with red 
basalt. The tiny disc of the Sun, easily visible 
from the pole of the non-rotating satellite, 
shone brighter than any other star in the 
black sky. The bitter frost, -170°C, felt like 
the ordinary cold of a northern winter on 
Earth through their heated protective suits. 
Huge flakes of snow, frozen ammonia or 
carbon monoxide, fell slowly through the 
still atmosphere, giving their surroundings the 
serene appearance of Earth during a snow-
fall. 

Erg Noor and Eon Thai stared hypnotized 
at the falling snowflakes as did their distant 
ancestors in the northern lands for whom the 
first snowfall meant the end of the farm year. 
And this unusual snow also meant the end of 
their journey and their labours. 

The biologist, in response to a subconscious 
impulse, held out his hand to the commander. 

"Our adventures are over and we are still 
alive and well—thanks to you!" 

Erg Noor made an abrupt gesture repelling 
his hand. 

"Are we all well? And thanks to whom am 
I alive?" 

Eon Thai was not put out. 
"I'm sure Nisa will be saved! The doctors 
here want to begin treatment immediately. 
Instructions have been received from Grimm 
Schar himself, you know, the head of the 
General Paralysis Laboratory." 

"Do they know what it is?" 
"Not yet. But Nisa has obviously been 
struck by some sort of current that condenses 
in the nerve nodes of the autonomous systems. 
When we find out how to put a stop to its extra-
ordinarily long action the girl will be cured. We 
have discovered the functioning of persistent 
psychic 
paralysis that 
was considered in-
curable for centuries, haven't we? This is 
something similar caused by an outsideexciter. 
We'll carry out some experiments on my pri-
soners, whether they are dead or alive, then... 
my arm will also begin to function again!" 

The commander felt ashamed and frowned; 
in his great sorrow he had forgotten how 
much the biologist had done for him. Not at 
all decent in a grown man! He took the biolo-
gist's hand and they expressed their warm 
friendship 
in 
man's 
age-old 
handshake. 

"Do you think the lethal organs of the 
black jelly-fish and that—that cross-shaped 
abomination are of the same order?" asked 
Erg Noor. 

"I don't doubt it, my arm tells me that. 
Adaptation to life in these black creatures, 
inhabitants of a planet rich in electricity, 
has taken the form of the accumulation and 
transformation 
of electric energy. They are 
obviously beasts of prey but we still don't 
know whom they prey on." 

"But do you remember what happened to 
us all when Nisa..." 

"That's another thing. I have thought a 
lot 
about 
that. 
When 
that 
awful 
cross 
appeared 
it 
radiated 
infrasonic waves 
of 
tremendous strength, that broke down our 
will-power. Sounds in that black world are 
also black and we cannot hear them. This 
monster dulls the consciousness with infraso-
nic effects, and then uses a sort of hypnosis 
much stronger than that once used by the 
now extinct big terrestrial snakes, like the 
anaconda, for example. That was that nearly 
finished us—if it had not been for Nisa..." 

Erg Noor looked at the distant Sun that 
was at that moment also shining on Earth. 
The Sun is man's eternal hope, has been 
since the prehistoric days when man drag-
ged out a pitiful existence in the teeth of 
ruthless nature. The Sun is the incarnation of 
the bright forces of the intellect driving away 
the darkness and the monsters of the night. 
And a joyful spark of hope went with him 
for the rest of his journey. 

The Director of the Triton Station came 
to see Erg Noor at the sanatorium to tell 
him that 
Earth wanted to speak to him. 
The Director's appearance in a building that 

was in strict quarantine meant that their iso-
lation was over and that Tantra would be able 
to complete her thirteen-year journey. Erg 
Noor came back looking more business-like 
than ever. 

"We are leaving today. I have been asked to 
take six people from the planetship Amat 
with us; the ship is remaining here to organ-
ize the mining of new mineral deposits on 
Pluto. We are taking back the expedition and 
the material they collected on Pluto. 

"These six people re-equipped an ordina-
ry planetship for the performance of a deed 
of great valour. They dived into the depths 
of hell, down through Pluto's thick atmo-
sphere of 
neon and 
methane, they 
flew 
through blizzards of ammonia snow, every 
second bringing fresh risks of collision with 
gigantic needles of frozen water as hard as 
steel. They managed to find a region where 
there are mountains. 

"The mystery of Pluto has been solved 
at last—it is a planet that does not belong to 
our solar system but one that was captured by 
the Sun during its passage through the Galaxy. 
This accounts for Pluto's density being much 
greater than that of any other planet. The 
explorers discovered strange minerals on this 
alien world but more important still, on one 
ridge they found an almost completely ruined 
structure that told of an inconceivably ancient 
civilization. 
The 
research 
data 
must, 
of 
course, be checked. The intelligent working of 
building materials has still to be proved. But 
still, an amazingly valorous deed has been 

done. I am proud that our spaceship will carry 
the heroes back to Earth and I am all impa-
tience to hear their stories. Their quarantine 
was over three days ago." 

Erg Noor stopped, exhausted by such a 
lengthy speech. 

"But there is a serious contradiction in 
this!" shouted Pour Hyss. 

"Contradiction is the mother of truth!" 
Erg Noor answered calmly, making use of an 
old proverb. "It's time to get Tantra ready." 

The tried and tested spaceship got away 
from 
Triton 
very 
easily and described a 
huge arc perpendicular to the plane of the 
ecliptic. It was impossible to get directly to 
Earth—any ship would have been destroyed in 
the wide asteroid and meteoroid belt, a zone 
filled with the fragments of the burst planet 
Phaeton 
that 
once existed between Mars 
and Jupiter and was exploded by the gravi-
tation of the giant of the solar system. 

Erg Noor increased acceleration. He did 
not intend to take his expedition back to 
Earth by the normal seventy-two-day route 
but to use the colossal power of the spaceship 
to make the journey in fifty hours with a 
minimum expenditure of anameson. 

Transmission from 
Earth raced through 
space to Tantra and the planet greeted the 
victory over the gloom of the iron star and 
over the gloom of icy Pluto. Specially written 
songs and symphonies in honour of Tantra 
and Amat were performed. 

The Cosmos resounded with triumphant 
melodies. Stations on Mars, Venus and the 

asteroids called the ship, their chords merging 
with the general chorus of homage to the 
heroes. 

"Tantra... 
Tantra..." came, at last, the voice 
from the Council's control post. "You may 
land on El Hombra!" 

The Central 
Cosmic 
Port was situated 
where there had formerly been a desert in 
North Africa and the spaceship made its way 
there through the sun-drenched atmosphere 
of Earth. 

Chapter Seven 

SYMPHONY IN F-MINOR. C O L O U R TONE 4.75 M 

The wall of the broad verandah facing 
south towards the sea was made of sheets of 
transparent plastic. The pale diffused light 
from the ceiling complemented rather than 
rivalled the moonlight, softening its dense 
black shadows. Almost the whole maritime 
expedition had gathered on the verandah, 
only 
the very 
youngest members of the 
expedition were still frolicking in the moonlit 
sea. Cart Sann, the artist, was there with his 
beautiful model. Frith Don, Director of the 
Expedition, shook back his long, golden hair 
as he told the people about the horse Miyiko 
had found. When they made tests of the 
material from which it was made in order to 
calculate the weight to be lifted they got the 
most unexpected results. Under the super-

ficial layer of some alloy the statue was pure 
gold. If the horse were cast solid then its 
weight, after allowance had been made for 
water displacement, would be four hundred 
tons. Special vessels with powerful salvage 
gear had been sent for—an unexpected devel-
opment from a pleasant afternoon's swim 
enjoyed by Miyiko Eigoro and Darr Veter. 

Somebody asked how so much valuable 
metal could have been used so foolishly. One 
of the older historians recalled a legend dis-
covered in the historical archives telling of 
the disappearance of the gold reserves of a 
whole country, and that at a time when gold 
was the monetary expression of labour values. 
Certain criminal 
rulers, guilty of 
tyranny 
and the impoverishment of the people, had 
been forced to flee to another country—in 
those days there were obstacles called fron-
tiers preventing contact between nations— 
and before absconding they gathered together 
the entire gold reserve and cast a statue from 
it and placed it in the busiest square of the 
country's chief city. Nobody was able to 
find the gold. The historian presumed that in 
those days nobody had been able to find the 
precious metal under the layer of the cheap 
alloy. 

The story caused some excitement. The 
find of a large quantity of gold was a fine gift 
to mankind. Although the heavy metal had 
long ceased to serve as a symbol of value it 
was still very necessary in electrical instru-
ments, medicines and, especially, for 
the 
manufacture of anameson. 

In a small group in a corner outside the 
verandah sat Veda Kong, Darr Veter, the ar-
tist, Chara Nandi and Evda Nahl. Renn Bose 
sat down bashfully 
beside them after his 
fruitless attempts to find Mven Mass. 

"You were right when you said that ar-
tists, or rather, art in general, must always 
inevitably lag behind the rapid advance of 
knowledge and technique," said Darr Veter. 

"You 
didn't 
understand 
me," 
objected 
Cart Sann. "Art has already corrected its 
errors and understood its duty to mankind. 
Art has ceased to create oppressive monu-
mental forms, to depict brilliance and majesty 
that do not exist in reality, for all that was 
purely superficial. Art's most important duty 
has become the development of man's emo-
tional side, since only art can rightly attune 
the human psyche and prepare it for the ac-
ceptance of the most complicated impressions. 
Who does not know how wonderfully easy it 
is to understand something when you have 
been pretuned by music, colour or form, and 
how inaccessible the human spirit is when 
you try to force a way into it. You historians 
know better than anybody else how much 
mankind has suffered through a lack of under-
standing of the necessity to train and develop 
the emotional side of the psyche." 

"There was a period in the past when art 
carved abstract forms," Veda Kong put in. 

"Art carved abstract forms in imitation 
of the intellect that had gained priority over 
everything else. Art, however, cannot find 
expression in the abstract, with the excep-

tion, of course, of music, and that occupies 
a special place and is concrete in its own way. 
Art in those days was on the wrong track." 

"What do you believe to be the right track?" 
"I believe that art should be a reflection of 
the struggle and anxieties of life in people's 
feelings, at times it should illustrate life but 
under the control of a common purposeful-
ness. This purposefulness, in other words, 
is beauty, without which I cannot see happi-
ness or a meaning for life. Without it art can 
easily degenerate into mere fanciful inven-
tion, especially if the artist has an insufficient 
knowledge of life and of history." 

"I have always wanted art to help conquer 
and change the world and not merely to 
sense the world," added Darr Veter. 

"I agree with that, but with one proviso," 
said Cart Sann. " A r t shouldn't treat the 
outside world alone; it's more important to 
treat of man's inner world, his emotions, his 
education. With an understanding of all con-
tradictions..." 

Evda Nahl placed her strong, warm hand on 
Darr Veter's. 

"What dream have you renounced today?" 
At first Veter wanted to put her off, but 
realized that with Evda equivocation was im-
possible. And so he pretended to be absorbed 
in the artist's discourse. 

"Those who have seen the mass art of the 
past," continued the artist, "cinema films, 
recordings of theatre shows, exhibitions of 
pictures, know how marvellously refined, ele-
gant, purged of all superfluities our present-

day spectacles, dances and pictures seem by 
contrast. 
I am not comparing them with 
the periods of decay, of course." 

"He's clever but too verbose," whispered 
Veda Kong. 

"It's difficult for an artist to express in 
words or formulas those complicated phe-
nomena that he sees and selects from his 
environment," Chara Nandi said in his de-
fence and Evda Nahl nodded approvingly. 

"What I want to do is something like this," 
continued Cart Sann. " I want to collect into 
one image the pure grains of the wonderful 
genuineness 
of 
feeling, form 
and 
colour 
scattered among many people. I want to 
restore the ancient images by the highest 
expression of the beauty of each of the races 
of the distant past that have gone into the 
make-up of mankind today. The Daughter of 
Gondwana 
is unity with nature, a subcon-
scious knowledge of the connections between 
things and phenomena, a complex of senses 
and feelings interlaced with instincts. 

" T h e Daughter 
of 
Thetis, 
the 
Mediterra-
nean, has strongly developed emotions that 
are fearlessly expansive and infinitely varying; 
here there is a different degree of the union 
with nature, through emotions, the power 
of Eros—that is how I imagine her. The an-
cient civilizations of the Mediterranean—the 
Cretan, Etruscan, Hellenic and Proto-lndian— 
gave rise to the type of man who, alone of 
all others, could have created the civilization 
that stemmed from the rule of woman. I had 
the best of luck when I discovered Chara: 

she is by pure accident a combination of the 
traits of ancestors from amongst the Graeco-
Cretans of antiquity and the later peoples 
of Central India." 

Veda smiled at the correctness of her guess 
and Darr Veter whispered to her that it would 
be hard to find a better model. 

" I f 
m y 
Daughter 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
turns out a success then I must go on to the 
third part of the plan—I must paint the gol-
den— 
or 
flaxen-haired 
northern 
woman, 
with her calm and transparent eyes, tall, 
somewhat slow in her movements, her glance 
straightforward as she looks out at the world 
like one of the ancient Russian, Scandinavian 
or English women. Only when that is fin-
ished shall I be able to start on the synthesis, 
the image of the present-day woman in which 
I shall have to portray the best features of 
each of those ancestors." 

"Why 
do 
you 
only 
paint 
'daughters' 
and no 'sons'?" asked Veda, smiling myste-
riously. 

"Is there any need for me to explain that 
by the laws of physiology the beautiful is 
always more finished and more refined in 
woman?" frowned the artist. 

"When you are ready to paint your third 
picture, your Daughter of the North, 
take a 
good look at Veda Kong," began Evda Nahl, 
"you'll hardly..." 

The artist rose swiftly to his feet. 
"D'you think I'm blind? I am struggling 
against myself to prevent that image becom-
ing part of me at a time when I am full of 

another. But Veda..." 

"Is dreaming of music," continued Veda. 
"What a pity there is only a solar piano here 
and it's silent at night." 

"Is that the piano with a system of semi-
conductors that works from sunlight?" asked 
Renn Bose, leaning over the arm of his chair. 
" I f it is, I can switch it over to use the current 
of the receiver." 

"Will it take long?" asked Veda, pleased 
at the opportunity. 

" I t would take about an hour." 
"Then don't bother. The news broadcast 
on the world circuit begins in an hour and we 
want to see and hear it. We've been busy 
the past two evenings and haven't switched 
on the receiver." 

"Then sing us something, Veda," asked 
Darr Veter. "Cart Sann has the eternal stringed 
instrument, the one that dates back to feudal 
society in the Dark Ages." 

"Guitar," guessed Chara Nandi. 
"Who'll play? I'll try myself, perhaps I 
can manage." 

"I'll 
play." Chara Nandi volunteered to 
go for the guitar. 

"We'll run together," suggested Frith Don. 
Chara roguishly tossed back her mass of 
black hair. Sherliss pulled a lever moving back 
the side wall of the verandah giving them a 
view of the eastern corner of the bay. Frith 
Don ran with long strides. Chara run with 
her head thrown back and soon fell behind 
but in the end they arrived at the studio 
together, plunged into the unlighted entrance 

and a second later reappeared to skim along 
the edge of the sea, stubborn and swift-
footed. Frith Don was the first to reach the 
verandah but Chara vaulted over the open 
side partition and was first in the room. 

Veda clapped her hands in admiration. 
"But Frith Don won last year's decathlon!" 
"And Chara Nandi was graduated from the 
Higher School of Dance, both departments, 
Ancient and Modern," retorted Cart Sann in 
the same tone. 

"Veda and I studied dancing too, but only 
in the 
lower 
grades," sighed Evda Nahl. 

"Everybody passes the lower grade nowa-
days," said the artist teasingly. 

Chara ran 
her fingers lightly over the 
strings, sticking out her small, firm chin. The 
guitar 
hummed 
low, 
pensive 
notes. 
The 
young woman's high-pitched voice combined 
longing and challenge. She sang a new song, 
one that had just come from the southern 
zone, a song of an unfulfilled dream. Veda's 
low contralto joined in and became the beam 
around which Charts voice coiled and quivered. 
It was a magnificent duet, the two singers 
were absolute opposites and yet they comple-
mented each other perfectly. Darr Veter turned 
his gaze from one to the other unable to 
decide to whom the singing was most becom-
ing—Veda, who stood leaning her elbows on 
the receiver and her head bowed under the 
weight of a mass of fair hair that glittered 
silver in the moonlight, or Chara, leaning 
forward with the guitar on her round, bare 
knees, with a face tanned by the sun in which 

the white of her teeth and the bluish whites 
of her eyes stood out in sharp contrast. 

The song finished, Chara picked idly at 
the strings. Darr Veter clenched his teeth-
she was strumming the song that had once 
separated him from Veda, a song that was 
now painful to her, too. 

She plucked at the strings spasmodically, 
the chords following each other and dying 
before they could merge. It was a jerky me-
lody, like the splashes of waves falling on the 
beach, spreading over the sand for an instant 
and then rolling back, one after another, to 
the black depths of the sea. Chara was quite 
unaware of anything, her clear voice gave 
life to the words of love that flew out into 
the icy void of the Cosmos from star to star, 
trying to find, to understand, to feel where 
he was ... he who had gone into the Cosmos 
for the great deed of discovery—he would 
never return—let it be so, if only one moment 
she could know what was happening to him, 
help him with a whispered word, a kind 
thought, a greeting! 

Veda remained silent and Chara felt there 
was something wrong, she broke off the song, 
jumped up, tossed the guitar to the artist 
and went over to where the fair-haired woman 
was standing, her head bowed guiltily. 

Veda smiled. 
"Dance for me, Chara." 
The latter nodded obediently but Frith 
Don stopped her. 

"The dances can wait, there's transmission 
beginning now." 

On the roof of the building a telescopic 
pipe was put up on which there were two 
metal sheets at right angles to each other 
surmounted by a circular structure with eight 
hemispheres 
arranged 
around 
its 
circum-
ference. The room was filled with the mighty 
sounds of 
the world information service. 

"The discussion of the project introduced 
by the Academy of Directed Radiation con-
tinues," said a man on the screen. "The pro-
ject provides for the substitution of electro-
nic recording for the linear alphabet. The pro-
ject is not being universally supported. The 
chief objection is the intricacy of the reading 
apparatus. The book will cease to be a friend 
to accompany men everywhere. Despite all 
its 
apparent 
advantages 
the 
project 
will 
probably be rejected!" 

"It's been discussed for a long time," said 
Renn Bose. 

" A 
big 
contradiction," 
answered 
Darr 
Veter, 
"on 
the one hand, there 
is the 
tempting simplicity of the writing and, on the 
other, the difficulty of reading." 

The man on the screen continued: 
"Yesterday's report is confirmed—Cosmic 
Expedition No. 37 has been heard from. They 
are returning..." 

Darr Veter was staggered by the strength 
of his own contrasting emotions. Out of the 
corner of his eye he saw Veda Kong slowly 
rise to her feet, her eyes opening wider and 
wider. With the keen ears of a lover Darr 
Veter caught the sound of her spasmodic 
breathing. 

"...from 
the 
direction 
of 
square 
four 
hundred and one; the ship has just come out 
of the negative field at one-hundredth of a 
parsec from Neptune's orbit. The expedition 
has been delayed through an encounter with 
a black sun. There have been no losses of life! 
The speed of the ship," said the news reader 
in conclusion, "is about five-sixths of the 
absolute unit. The expedition is expected at 
Triton in eleven days!.. Listen for reports of 
their marvellous discoveries!" 

The broadcast continued. There were other 
items of news but nobody listened to them 
any more. They crowded round Veda, con-
gratulating her. She smiled, her cheeks were 
burning but there was anxiety hidden deep 
down in her eyes. Darr Veter also approached 
her. Veda felt the firm pressure of his hand 
and met his eyes, direct and sincere. Not for a 
long time had he looked at her like that and 
she understood the sadness of this former 
attitude towards her and she realized that at 
that moment he read something else in her 
face besides joy. 

Darr 
Veter 
slowly 
released 
her 
hand, 
smiled in a way all his own, inimitably open 
and frank, and walked away. Her companions 
from the expedition were excitedly discussing 
the news. Veda remained inside the circle 
of people but watched Darr Veter out of the 
corner of her eye. She saw Evda Nahl go up 
to him and a moment later they were joined 
by Renn Bose. 

"We must find Mven Mass, he still doesn't 
know the news!" exclaimed Darr Veter,as though 

he had suddenly remembered. "Come along 
with me, Evda. And what about you, Renn?" 

"I'll come too," said Chara Nandi as she 
came up. "May I?" 

They went down towards the gently lapp-
ing waves. Darr Veter stopped, turned his 
face to the cool breeze and sighed deeply. 
Turning round he met Evda Nahl's eyes. 

"I'm going away without returning to the 
house," he said in answer to her unasked 
question. Evda took him by the arm. For 
some time they walked on in silence. 

"I've been thinking... must you?" whis-
pered Evda. "But 
I suppose you must, I 
suppose you're right. If Veda..." Evda stopped, 
but Darr Veter squeezed her hand understand-
ing^ and pressed it to his cheek. Renn Bose 
followed on their heels, carefully edging away 
from Chara who, with a slightly 
mocking 
smile, ogled him with her big eyes and swayed 
her body exaggeratedly as she walked with 
long steps beside him. Evda laughed a scarce-
ly audible laugh and suddenly offered the 
physicist her free arm. Renn Bose seized it 
with a predatory movement that seemed fun-
ny in that bashful fellow. 

"Where are we to look for your friend?" 
asked Chara, stopping at the edge of the wa-
ter. Darr Veter looked round in the bright 
moonlight and saw fresh footprints on the 
strip of wet sand. They were made at exact-
ly the same intervals and the soles were 
turned 
outward 
symmetrically 
with 
such 
precision that the footprints seemed to be 
the work of a machine. 

"He 
went that way," said Darr Veter 
pointing towards some big boulders. 

"Yes, those are his footprints," confirmed 
Evda Nahl. 

"Why are you so sure?" asked Chara doubt-
fully. 

"Look at the regularity of the paces, that's 
how primitive hunters walked... or those 
who have inherited their traits. It seems to 
me that Mven, despite all his learning, is 
closer to nature than any of us ... although ... 
I don't 
know 
about 
you, Chara." 
Evda 
turned to the girl who was pondering over 
something. 

"Me? Oh, no!" She pointed forward and 
exclaimed, "There he is!" 

The huge figure of the African, shining 
like polished black marble in the moonlight, 
appeared on the nearest boulder. Mven Mass 
was shaking his fists energetically as though 
he were threatening somebody. The power-
ful muscles of his mighty body rose and fell 
and rolled beneath his gleaming skin. 

"He's like the spirit of the night from the 
children's tales," whispered Chara excitedly. 
Mven Mass noticed the people approaching 
him, jumped down from his rock and soon 
appeared before them with his clothes on. In 
a few words Darr Veter explained what had 
happened and Mven Mass expressed a desire 
to see Veda Kong. 

"Go over there with Chara," said Evda, 
"and we'll stay down here for a little while." 
Darr Veter made a gesture of farewell and 
saw by Mven's face that he had understood. 

A burst of something like childishness egged 
Mven on to whisper words of farewell that 
had long since gone out of usage. Darr Veter 
was touched by this gesture and walked away, 
deep in thought, accompanied by the silent 
Evda. Renn Bose hesitated for a while in 
some confusion and then followed behind 
Mven Mass and Chara. 

Darr Veter and Evda walked down as far 
as the cape that protected the bay from the 
open sea. From there they would see the 
lights round the huge disc-shaped rafts of the 
maritime expedition. 

Darr Veter pushed a transparent plastic 
boat off the sand and stood by the water in 
front of Evda, even more massive and power-
ful than Mven Mass. Evda stretched up on 
tiptoes to give her friend a parting kiss. 

"Veter, I'll be with Veda," she said, as 
though answering his thoughts. "We'll go back 
to our zone together and there we'll await 
your arrival. Let me know where you fix 
yourself up, I'll always be glad to help you." 

For a long time Evda followed the boat 
with her eyes as it crossed the silvery sea. 

Darr Veter went as far as the second raft 
where the mechanics were still working in a 
hurry to set up the accumulators. In response 
to Veter's request they lit three green lights 
in the form of a triangle. An hour and a half 
later, the first helicopter that came that way 
hung over the raft, the roar of its engines 
rumbling over the sleepy sea. Darr Veter en-
tered the lift it lowered; for a second he 
could be seen against the illuminated bottom 

of the aicraft and then disappeared through 
the hatch. By morning he reached his perma-
nent abode near the Council 
observatory 
which he had not had time to change for 
another. Darr Veter opened the air-taps in 
both his rooms and in a few minutes all 
dust had vanished. He pulled his bed out of 
the wall and, tuning his bedroom in to the 
smell and sounds of the sea that he had late-
ly become accustomed to, was soon sound 
asleep. 

He awoke with a sensation that the beauty 
of the world had been lost. Veda was far 
away and would remain far away ... now ... 
until... But he must help her and not compli-
cate matters! 

In his bathroom a whirling column of 
cold electrified water burst upon him. Darr 
Veter stood under the column of water so 
long that he began to shiver. Feeling refreshed 
he went to the televisophone, opened its 
mirror doors and called up the nearest Regis-
ter of Vacancies. The face of the registrar, 
a young man, appeared on the screen. He 
knew Darr Veter and greeted him with a 
scarcely perceptible shade of respect that was 
considered the hallmark of politeness. 

"I want to get some hard and lengthy 
job, with tough physical labour," said Darr 
Veter, "something like the antarctic mines." 

"All the jobs there are taken!" answered 
the registrar, in tones of sincere regret. "All 
the miner's jobs on Venus, Mars and even 
Mercury have been filled too. You know that 
the young people are always anxious to go 

where the work is hardest." 

"That's true but I can no longer place 
myself in that fine category. What is there 
now? I want a job immediately." 

"There are the diamond workings in Cen-
tral 
Siberia," 
began the 
registrar 
slowly, 
glancing at a list that Darr Veter could not 
see, "that is, if you want mine work. Then 
there are some jobs on the rafts of the oceanic 
food-packing plants, at the solar pumping 
station in Tibet, but that's easy work. There 
are some other places, but nothing particular-
ly hard." 

Darr Veter thanked him and asked for 
some time to think things over and asked him 
to keep the place open in the diamond work-
ings. 

He switched off the Registrar of Vacan-
cies and tuned in to Siberia House, the centre 
for geographical information concerning that 
country. His televisophone was switched on 
to a memory machine that showed him the 
latest records and he saw pictures of exten-
sive forests go floating past him. The boggy, 
scanty, larch forests growing on permafrost 
that had once occupied the region were gone 
for ever, giving place to such giants as Siber-
ian 
cedars 
and 
American sequoias, trees 
that had formely been in danger of extinc-
tion. Their gigantic red trunks made a magni-
ficent fence round hills covered with ferro-
concrete caps. Steel tubes thirty feet in dia-
meter, crawled from under the caps and 
curved over ridges to the nearest rivers that 
they sucked entirely into their huge scoops. 

Monstrously 
huge 
pumps 
roared 
dully. 
Billions of gallons of water were driven into 
the volcanic chimneys where the diamonds 
were found; the water whirled and raged as it 
washed the clay away and then found its way 
out again leaving behind tons of diamonds on 
the grids of the washing chambers. In long, 
well-lit buildings people were watching the 
dials of the sorting machines. The brilliant 
stones were sifted like grain through the 
calibrated holes of a screen into boxes. The 
pumping station operators were keeping con-
stant watch over the calculating machines that 
computed the ever-changing resistance of the 
rock, the pressure and expenditure of water, 
the shaft and the expulsion of solid matter. 
Darr Veter thought that though the joyful 
picture of sun-bathed forests did not suit his 
mood at that 
moment, the concentrated 
activity of the work at the pumps might suit 
him and he switched off Siberia House. 
Immediately the call signal rang out and the 
Registrar 
of 
Vacancies 
appeared 
on 
the 
screen. 

"I'd like to give you something more con-
crete to think about. We have received a re-
quest for somebody to fill a vacancy that 
has just occurred in the submarine titanium 
mines off the west coast of South America. 
This is the hardest work available today, but 
if you take it you'll have to go there im-
mediately." 

That last piece of information rather upset 
Darr Veter. 

"But I shan't have time to pass the tests at 

the nearest station of the Academy of the 
Psychophysiology 
of 
Labour," 
he 
said. 

"The sum of the annual tests that were 
obligatory for your former work is sufficient 
to exempt you from them." 

"Inform them that I'm coming and give me 
the coordinates!" answered Darr Veter im-
mediately. 

"Western section of the Spiral Way, seven-
teenth southern branch, Station 6L, Point 
KM40. I'll inform them." 

The serious-looking face disappeared from 
the screen. Darr Veter gathered together all 
the little trifles that belonged to him per-
sonally and filled a box with films containing 
the photographs and voices of his nearest 
relatives and friends and the most impor-
tant records of his own thoughts. He took 
a chromoreflex reproduction of an old Rus-
sian picture from the wall and from the table 
he took a bronze statuette of the actress 
Bello Galle, which he kept because it bore a 
resemblance to Veda Kong. All these things 
and his few clothes he packed into an alumi-
nium box with some letters and figures em-
bossed on the lid. Darr Veter dialled the coor-
dinates he had been given, opened a hatch 
in the wall and pushed the box into it. The 
box disappeared, taken up by an endless belt. 
Then he checked up on his rooms. Long be-
fore the Great Circle Era special cleaners and 
charwomen had been abolished. The work 
was now done by every person in his own 
place, something he could do because of his 
sense of absolute orderliness and discipline 

and because domestic and public buildings 
were designed more conveniently and fitted 
with means to clean and air them automatical-
ly. 

When he had finished his examination he 
pulled down the lever at the door which 
immediately informed the Housing Bureau 
that his rooms had been vacated. Outside, 
on an external gallery glazed with sheets of 
milk-coloured plastic, the sun's warmth made 
itself felt, but on the flat roof the sea breeze 
was as cool as ever. The light foot-bridges 
thrown from one high latticed building to 
another seemed to be soaring in the air and 
tempting the onlooker to a leisurely saunter 
along them. Darr Veter, however, no longer 
belonged to himself. Through the tubular 
tunnel of the automatic descent he made his 
way 
to 
the 
underground 
electromagnetic 
mail tunnel and a tiny truck took him with 
switchback-like 
movements 
to 
the 
Spiral 
Way station. Darr Veter did not travel north, 
to the Behring Straits, where he could get on 
the intercontinental arch of the Spiral Way. 
To reach South America by this route, es-
pecially 
as far south as the seventeenth 
branch, would take four days and nights. 
In 
the 
northern 
and southern 
inhabited 
zones there were helicopter lines that handled 
heavy cargo round the planet, crossing the 
oceans and short-circulating the 
branches 
of the Spiral Way. Darr Veter travelled by 
the Central Branch as far as the southern in-
habited zone, hoping there to be able to con-
vince the Director of Transport that he was 

urgent cargo. Not to mention that the jour-
ney had been shortened by up to thirty 
hours by going this way he would be able to 
see Diss Ken, the son of Grom Orme, Pres-
ident of 
the 
Astronautical 
Council, 
who 
had selected him as his mentor. 

Diss Ken had come to the end of his school 
years and in the following year would begin 
his twelve Labours of Hercules; in the mean-
time he was working in the Watchers' Service 
of the West-African swamps. 

Every youth wanted to enter the Watchers' 
Service—to keep a look-out for sharks in the 
ocean, for harmful insects, vampires and rep-
tiles in the tropical swamps, for disease mi-
crobes in the living zones, for epizoons and 
forest fires in the savanna and forest zones-
hunting down and destroying all harmful life 
left over from the old world that in some 
mysterious way kept reappearing in remote 
corners of the planet. The struggle against 
harmful forms of life never ceased for a mo-
ment. 
Microorganisms, 
insects 
and 
fungi 
reacted to new and most radical chemical 
destroyers by evolving new, impervious forms. 
People learned to make proper use of strong 
antibiotics without generating dangerous and 
stable bacteria only after the Era of Disunity. 

"If 
Diss Ken has been appointed to the 
Swamp 
Watchers' Service," 
thought 
Darr 
Veter, 
"he must be a serious young man." 

Diss Ken, Grom Orme's son, like all chil-
dren in the Great Circle Era, had been brought 
up away from his parents in a school on the 
seashore in the northern zone. There, too. 

he had passed the first tests made by a local 
station of the Academy of the Psychophysiol-
ogy of 
Labour. When young people were 
allotted work the psychological specifics of 
youth—the urge to go farther, an exaggerated 
sense 
of 
responsibility 
and 
egocentrism— 
were taken into consideration. 

The huge coach ran on smoothly and silent-
ly. Darr Veter went up to the top deck where 
there was a transparent roof. Far below, on 
either side of the Spiral Way, buildings, ca-
nals, forests and mountain tops swept past. 
The brightly gleaming, transparent domes of 
buildings marked the narrow belt of automa-
tic factories at the junction of the agricultur-
al and forestry belts. The rugged shapes of 
the huge servicing machines could be clearly 
seen through the glass walls of the buildings. 

The monument erected to Zhinn Cahd, the 
inventor of a cheap method of manufactur-
ing artificial sugar, flashed past and then the 
arches of the Spiral Way cut across the forests 
of the tropical agricultural zone. Plantations 
of trees stretching away into infinite distance 
showed every conceivable shade of leaf and 
bark and great variety in the shape and height. 
Harvesting, pollination and calculating ma-
chines crawled along the smooth narrow roads 
that 
separated 
the 
plantations; 
countless 
cables formed a giant cobweb. There was a 
time when a field of ripe, golden corn had 
been the symbol of abundance. In the Era of 
World Unity, however, the economic inef-
ficiency of annual crops was realized and, 
after all farming had been transferred to the 

tropical belt, the hard labour involved in the 
annual 
cultivation 
of 
herbage 
and 
bush 
plants 
became 
unnecessary. 
In the Great 
Circle Era perennial trees that did not take 
too much out of the soii and were imper-
vious to climatic changes became the chief 
crop. 

Bread, berry and nut trees, yielding thous-
ands of different kinds of fruit rich in pro-
tein, produced up to a hundred kilograms of 
food each. Forests of these trees ran round 
the planet in two belts covering thousands of 
millions of acres—true belts of Ceres, the 
ancient 
Goddess of 
Agriculture. 
Between 
these two belts lay the equatorial forestry 
zone, an ocean of humid tropical forests 
that supplied the whole world with its tim-
ber—white, black, violet, pink, golden and 
grey wood with a silky grain, wood as hard as 
bone or as soft as an apple, wood that sank 
like a stone and wood that floated like cork. 
The forests also yielded dozens of kinds of 
resin possessing valuable technical or medi-
cinal properties that were cheaper than the 
synthetic varieties. 

The tops of the forest giants were level 
with the permanent way and waved and 
surged on both sides like a green ocean. In 
the dark depths of these forests, in cosy-
looking glades, stood houses on metal piles 
and beside them mechanical spider-like mon-
sters capable 
of 
turning these stands of 
80-metre trees into stacks of logs and planks. 

To the left appeared the rounded summits 
of the famous equatorial mountains. On one 

of them, Kenya, was the installation for the 
maintenance 
of 
communications with 
the 
Great Circle. 
The 
ocean of trees moved 
away to the left, making way for a stony 
plateau. Blue cube-shaped buildings appeared 
on both sides. 

The train stopped and Darr Veter stepped 
out on to the extensive, glass-paved square of 
the Equator Station. Near the foot-bridge 
that stretched over the grey tops of the Atlas 
cedars, stood a white truncated pyramid of 
porcelain-like aplite from the River Lualaba, 
surmounted by the statue of a worker of an 
age-long past. The luxuriant silver foliage of 
trees brought from South Africa surround-
ed the pedestal whose sides gleamed dazzlingly 
bright in the sunshine. In his right hand he 
held a gleaming sphere with four transmitting 
antennae jutting out from it, his left was 
stretched out towards the pale equatorial 
sky. The man's body, straining-backwards 
as though to launch the sphere into the sky, 
was the expression of inspired effort. The fi-
gures of people in strange clothing, arranged 
around the pedestal at the feet of the cen-
tral figure, increased the impression of effort. 
This was a monument to the builders of the 
first man-made Earth satellites, people who 
had 
performed 
miracles of 
inventiveness, 
labour and courage. 

Darr Veter could never look at these sculp-
tured faces without a feeling of excitement. 
He knew that the first people to build arti-
ficial Earth satellites and reach the threshold 
of 
the 
Cosmos had been 
Russians, 
that 

amazing nation from whom Darr Veter was 
descended, the people who had taken the 
first steps towards building the new social 
order and towards the conquest of the Cos-
mos... 

That day, as usual, Darr Veter made his 
way to the monument to look once more at 
the carvings of the heroes of ancient times 
and to see in what way they were similar to 
and different from the people of his own day 
and himself in particular. 

Two 
tall, 
youthful 
figures 
appeared 
through the trees, stopped and then one of 
them rushed to Darr Veter. He placed his 
arms round Veter's shoulders and took a 
stealthy look at the familiar features of that 
well-known face—the big nose, wide chin, 
the unexpectedly mirthful turn of the lips 
that did not seem to fit in with the rather 
grim expression of the steel-grey eyes under 
their joined brows. 

Darr Veter cast a glance of approval over 
the son of a famous man who had built bases 
on the planets of the Centaurus system and 
had been elected President of the Astronauti-
cal Council for five three-year periods in suc-
cession. Grom Orme must have been at least 
130 years old—three times the age of Darr 
Veter—but his son was very young. 

Diss Ken called over his friend, a dark-
haired boy. 

"This is Thor Ahn, my best friend, the son 
of Zieg Zohr, the composer," he said. "We're 
working 
together in the swamps and we 
want to do our Labours of Hercules together 

and after that we want to continue working 
together." 

"Are you still interested in the cybernetics 
of heredity?" asked Darr Veter. 

"Oh, yes! Thor has got me even more in-
terested—he's a musician, like his father. He 
and his girlfriend dream of working in a field 
where music helps us understand the develop-
ment of living organisms, that is, they want 
to study the symphony of their structure..." 

"It's all very indefinite, the way you put 
it," said Veter, frowning. 

"I 
don't 
know enough yet," answered 
Diss in confusion, "perhaps Thor can tell 
you better than I." 

The other lad blushed but stood up to the 
test of the penetrating glance. 

"Diss wanted to tell you about the rhythms 
of the mechanism of heredity. As the living 
organism develops from the original cell it 
attunes itself by chords of molecules. The 
primordial paired spiral develops along lines 
analogous to the development of a musical 
symphony, or to put it another way, to the 
logical development in an electronic comput-
ing machine." 

"Really!" exclaimed Darr Veter in exagge-
rated astonishment. "Then you will reduce 
the entire evolution of all living and non-living 
matter to some sort of a gigantic symphony?" 

"The plan and internal rhythm of which 
are determined by basic physical laws. We 
have only to understand how the programme 
is built up and where the information of the 
musico-cybernetic mechanism comes from," 

insisted Thor Ahn with the unconquerable 
confidence of youth. 

"Whose idea is it?" 
"My father's, Zieg Zohr's. He recently pub-
lished his 13th Cosmic Symphony in F-minor, 
Colour Tone 4.75ju." 

"I'll most certainly hear it! 
I love blue 
tones... Now about your immediate plans, 
your Labours of Hercules. Do you know what 
has been allotted you?" 

"Only the first six." 
"Of course, the other six will be allotted 
when the first half has been done," Darr 
Veter recalled. 

"Clean out the lower tier of the Kon-i-Gut 
caves in Central Asia so that visitors can go 
there," began Thor Ahn. 

"Build a road to Lake Mental across the 
steep mountain ridge," continued Diss Ken, 
"renew a grove of old bread trees in the Ar-
gentine, explain the causes for the appearance 
of big octopuses in the region of the recent 
lift near Trinidad..." 

"And destroy them!" 
"That's five, what's the sixth?" 
The two lads turned somewhat bashful. 
"We are both proficient at music," began 
Diss Ken, blushing, "and ... we have been 
asked to 
collect material on the ancient 
dances of the Island of Bali and resuscitate 
them musically and choreographically." 

"By that do you mean select girls to dance 
them and form a troupe?" laughed Darr 
Veter. 

"Yes," 
admitted Thor Ahn, unwillingly. 

"An interesting job. But that's a group job, 
like the road to the lake, isn't it?" 

"Yes, we've got a good group. Only ... they 
want you to be their mentor, too. It would be 
fine if you only agreed!" 

Darr Veter doubted his abilities with regard 
to the last of the six tasks. The lads, however, 
their faces beaming, danced for joy and as-
sured him that "Zieg Zohr himself" 
had 
promised to guide the sixth task. 

"In a year and four months I'll find myself 
something to do in Central Asia," said Darr 
Veter, pleased at the happy faces of the two 
youngsters. 

"It's a good thing you're not Director of 
the Outer Stations any more," exclaimed 
Diss Ken, " I never thought I'd be working 
with such a mentor!.." The lad suddenly 
blushed so furiously that his forehead was 
covered with tiny beads of perspiration and 
Thor even moved away from him with an 
expression of reproach. Darr Veter hurried 
to help Grom Orme's son over his faux pas. 

"Have you got plenty of time?" 
"No, we were given three hours off and we 
brought a man here who is ill with a fever 
he caught in our swamps." 

"Is there still fever here? I thought..." 
"It's very rare and only occurs in the 
swamps," put in Diss, very hurriedly. "That's 
what we're here for!" 

"So we still have two hours left. Let's 
go into the town, you'll probably want to go 
to News House." 

"Oh, no. We'd like you to ... answer our 

questions—we have got them ready and you 
know how important it is when we are select-
ing our life's work." 

Darr Veter gave his consent and the three 
of them went to the Guest Hall and sat in one 
of its cool rooms fanned with an artificial 
sea breeze. 

Two hours later another coach took Darr 
Veter farther on his way; tired out he dozed 
on a sofa on the lower deck. He woke up 
when the train stopped in the City of Chem-
ists. A huge structure in the form of a star 
with ten glazed glass-covered radial buildings 
stretching from it rose up over an extensive 
coal-field. The coal that was extracted here 
was 
processed 
into 
medicines, 
vitamins, 
hormones, artificial silk and fur. The waste 
products went for the manufacture of sugar. 
In one of the rays of the star the rare metals 
germanium 
and vanadium 
were 
extracted 
from the coal—there was no end to the things 
that could be got out of that valuable black 
mineral! 

One of 
Darr 
Veter's old friends 
who 
worked as a chemist in the fur ray came to 
the station to meet him. Once, long before, 
there had been three happy young mechan-
ics working on the fruit-gathering machines 
in Indonesia. Now one of them was a chemist 
in charge of a laboratory in a big factory, the 
second had remained a fruit-grower and had 
invented a valuable new pollination process 
and the third, Darr Veter, was once more 
returning to Mother Earth, only deeper down 
this time, into the mines. The friends spent 

no more than ten minutes together, 
but 
even such a meeting was much pleasanter 
than meetings on the TVP. 

He had not much farther to go. The Direc-
tor of the Latitudinal Air Lines listened to his 
persuasion with the friendly helpfulness that 
was typical of the Great Circle Era. Darr 
Veter flew across the ocean and arrived on 
the western section of the Spiral Way south 
of the seventeenth branch, at the dead end of 
which he transferred to a hydroplane to con-
tinue his journey. 

High mountains came right down to the 
sea. The gentler slopes at the foot were 
terraced with white stone to hold the soil 
and were planted with rows of 
southern 
pipes and Widringtonia in alternate avenues 
of bronze and bluish-green needles. High up 
the bare rocks, there were clefts to be seen in 
which waterfalls sent up clouds of water dust. 
Buildings painted bright orange or yellow 
with bluish-grey roof stretched at intervals 
along the terraces. 

Jutting out into sea there was an artificial 
sandbank at the end of which stood a wave-
washed tower. It stood at the edge of the 
continental shelf which in those parts ended 
in a submarine cliff a good thousand metres 
deep. From the tower an extremely thick 
concrete pipe, strong enough to withstand the 
pressure in the depths of the ocean, led down 
vertically. At the bottom the pipe rested on 
the summit of a submarine mountain that 
consisted almost entirely of pure rutile or 
titanium dioxide. The processing of the ore 

was done under the water, inside the moun-
tain. All that reached the surface was slabs of 
pure titanium and waste products that spread 
far into sea, turning the water a muddy 
yellow. The hydroplane tossed on the yellow 
waves in front of the landing stage on the sou-
thern side of the tower, and Darr Veter waited 
his opportunity to jump on to the spray-soaked 
platform. He went upstairs to the railed gal-
lery where several people not on duty, gathered 
to welcome the newcomer. Darr Veter had 
imagined the mine to be in complete isolation 
but the people who met him were not at all the 
anchorites his own mood had led him to expect 
The faces that greeted him were happy even if 
they were somewhat tired from their exacting 
work. There were five men and three women— 
so women worked there, too! 

Before ten days had passed Darr Veter 
had settled down to his new job. 

The mine had its own power plant—in 
the depths of the abandoned workings on the 
mainland there was an old nuclear power-
station type E, or type 2, as it used to be 
called, which did not have a harmful fall-out 
and was, therefore, useful for 
local sta-
tions. 

A most involved complex of machines was 
housed in the stone belly of the submarine 
mountain and moved forward as it bit into 
the friable reddish-brown mineral. The most 
difficult work was at the bottom of the 
installation where the ore was automatically 
extracted and crushed. The machine received 
signals from the central control post in the 

upper storey where all the data on the work 
of the cutting and crushing apparatus, on the 
changing 
hardness 
and 
viscosity 
of 
the 
extracted rock as well as information from 
the flotation tables were accumulated. Depend-
ing on the changing metal content in the ore, 
the crushing and washing arrangements were 
accelerated or decelerated. The work had to 
be done by mechanics as the entire control 
could not be passed over to cybernetic ma-
chines owing to the small area protected from 
the sea. 

Darr Veter was given the job of mechanic, 
testing and setting the lower assembly. He 
spent his daily tours of duty in semi-dark 
rooms, packed with indicator dials, where the 
pump of the air conditioning system could 
scarcely cope with the overwhelming heat 
made worse by the increased pressure due 
to 
the 
inevitable 
leakage of 
compressed 
air. 

After work Darr Veter and his young assis-
tant would make their way to the top, stand 
for 
a long time on the balcony 
breath-
ing in the fresh air, then take a bath, eat and 
go each to his own room in one of the houses 
at the pithead. Darr Veter had tried to renew 
his study of the new cochlear branch of 
mathematics but, as time went on, he began 
to fall asleep more and more quickly, waking 
up only in time for work. As the months 
passed he began to feel better. He seemed 
to have forgotten his former contact with 
the Cosmos. Like all other workers at the 
titanium mines he got pleasure out of seeing 

off the rafts that transported the ingots of 
titanium. Since the polar icecaps had been 
reduced, storms all over the planet had de-
creased in violence so that many cargoes 
could 
be 
transported on sea-going rafts, 
either pulled by tugs or self-propelled. The 
staff of the mines changed but Darr Veter, 
with two other mining enthusiasts, stayed 
for another term. 

Nothing goes on forever in this changing 
world and in the mine the ore crushing and 
washing assembly had to stop work for an 
overhaul. It was then that Darr Veter made 
his first visit to the mines chamber beyond 
the tunnelling shield where he had to wear 
a special suit to protect him from the heat 
and pressure and from sudden streams of 
poisonous gas that burst out of cracks in 
the 
rocks. 
The 
brilliantly 
illuminated 
brown rutile walls gleamed with a special 
diamondlike lustre of their own and gave 
off flashing red lights like the 
infuriated 
glower of eyes hidden in the mineral. It 
was exceptionally 
quiet 
in the 
chamber. 
The 
hydro-electric 
spark 
rock-drill 
and 
the huge discs radiating ultra-short waves 
stood motionless for the first time in many 
months. Geophysicists, who had only just 
arrived, were busy under the shields setting up 
their instruments, so as to take advantage of 
the stoppage to check the contours of the 
mineral deposit. 

On the surface it was autumn, a period of 
calm, hot days in the south. Darr Veter went 
up into the mountains and felt very strongly 

the loneliness of those masses of stone that 
had stood poised between sea and sky for 
thousands of years. The dry grass rustled and 
from down below came the faint sounds of 
the surf beating against the shore. His tired 
body asked for rest but his brain grasped 
hungrily at impressions of the world that 
came fresh to him after long, arduous labour 
underground. 

The former Director of the Outer Stations, 
breathing deeply the odour of heated rocks 
and desert grasses, recalled the little island 
in a distant sea where the golden horse had 
been hidden. And he had faith in his intuitive 
feeling that there was much that was good 
still ahead of him, and that the better and 
stronger he himself was the more of the good 
there would be. 

Sow a fault and reap a habit. 
Sow a habit and reap a 
character, 

Sow 
a character 
and reap 
your 
fate... 

was the way the old saw went. Yes, he thought 
to himself, man's greatest fight is against 
egoism. This is a fight that cannot be fought 
by sentimental rules and pretty but helpless 
morals but by the dialectic realization that 
egoism is not the outcome of some forces of 
evil but is a natural instinct of primitive man 
that played an important role in his life as a 
savage and had been his means of self-preser-
vation. This is why strong, outstanding individ-
uals often have egoism highly developed and 
find it difficult to combat. The victory over 

egoism is, however, essential, probably the 
most important thing in modern society. This 
accounts for the time and effort that are 
expended on the upbringing of young people 
and the care with which the structure of every 
person's heredity is studied. In the great mix-
ture of races and peoples that forms the single 
family of our planet today, the most un-
expected traits of character belonging to 
distant ancestors suddenly emerge out of the 
depths of heredity. There are the most amaz-
ing deviations of a psychology acquired at the 
time of the great calamities in the Era of 
Disunity, when engineers were not careful 
enough in their use of nuclear energy and did 
great hereditary harm to many people. There 
was a time when genealogies were drawn up 
for predatory conquerors who called them-
selves noble and highborn; this was done to 
enable them to place themselves and their 
families above all others. Today we under-
stand the great importance of genealogy in 
life—in the selection of a profession, for me-
dical treatment, etc. Darr Veter had formerly 
possessed a long genealogy, but today such 
things are no longer necessary. The study of 
ancestors has been replaced by the direct 
analysis of the structure of heredity mecha-
nisms which is much more important in view 
of greater longevity. Ever since the Era of 
Common 
Labour people have been living 
to the age of 170 and now it is clear that even 
300 is not the limit... 

The rattle of stones awakened Darr Veter 
out of his complicated and vague reverie. 

Coming down the valley from above were 
two people, an operator from the electro-
smelting section, a reticent and bashful young 
woman and an excellent pianist, and an en-
gineer from the surface workings, lively and 
small in stature. They were both flushed 
from their rapid walk, greeted Darr Veter 
and would have passed on, but he stopped 
them in response to something he suddenly 
remembered. 

"I've been wanting to ask you a long time," 
he said, turning to the young woman. "Can 
you play something for me—the 13th Blue 
Cosmic Symphony in F-Minor. You've often 
played for us but you've never played that 
even once." 

"Do you mean Zieg Zohr's Cosmic?" she 
asked and when Darr Veter answered with a 
nod of confirmation she burst out laughing. 

"There aren't many people on the planet 
who could play that piece for you. A solar 
piano with a triple key-board is not enough 
and it hasn't been transposed yet... and prob-
ably never will be. Why don't you ask the 
House of Higher Music to play a recording 
for you? Our receiver is universal and has 
power enough!" 

"I don't know how," muttered Darr Ve-
ter, "before, I never..." 

"I'll do it for you this evening," she said 
and, holding out her hand to her companion, 
continued her way down the valley. 

For the rest of the day Darr Veter could 
not rid himself of the feeling that something 
important was going to happen. It was prob-

ably the same feeling that had come over 
Mven Mass on his first night's work at the 
observatory. With a peculiar impatience he 
waited for eleven o'clock, the time the House 
of Higher Music had appointed for the trans-
mission of the symphony. 

The electro-smelting operator undertook 
the role of Master of Ceremonies and seated 
Darr Veter and other music lovers in the fo-
cus of the hemispherical screen and opposite 
the sound reproducer in the music room. She 
turned out the lights, explaining that with 
them on it would be difficult to follow the 
colour scheme of the symphony that could 
only be properly performed in a special hall 
and must, in this transmission, of necessity 
be confined to the limits of the screen. 

The screen flickered faintly in the darkness 
and the noise of the sea could just be heard. 
Somewhere, incredibly far away, a low note 
sounded, a note so rich in tone that it seemed 
almost tangible. It grew in volume, shattering 
the room and the hearts of the listeners and 
then suddenly became softer, rose to a higher 
note and was broken and scattered in a mil-
lion crystal fragments. Tiny orange sparks 
appeared in the dark atmosphere. It was 
like that flash of primordial lightning whose 
discharge on Earth, millions of centuries ago, 
had fused simple carbon compounds to form 
the more intricate molecules, the basis of 
organic matter and life. 

A wave of alarming and dissonant sounds 
flooded the room, a thousand-voiced chorus 
of will-power, yearning and despair to comple-

ment which vague shadows of purple and 
vermillion came in hurried flashes and died 
away again. 

In the movement of the short and strongly 
vibrant notes a circular arrangement could 
be felt and was accompanied by an irregular 
spiral of whirling grey fire in the heights. 
Suddenly the whirling chorus of sounds was 
severed by long notes, proud and resonant, 
filled with impetuous force. 

The vague fiery outlines of space were 
pierced by clear lines of blue fiery arrows that 
flew into the bottomless void beyond the 
edges of the spiral and were drowned in the 
darkness of horror and silence. 

Darkness and silence—on this note ended 
the first movement of the symphony. 

The audience, slightly staggered, did not 
have time to pronounce a single word before 
the music began again. Extensive cascades of 
powerful sounds were accompanied by dazzl-
ing opalescences that covered the 
whole 
spectrum; they fell, weakening as they grew 
lower, and glowing fire died away to their 
melancholy rhythm. Again something narrow 
and 
vehement 
broke through 
the 
falling 
cascades and again blue lights began their 
rhythmic, dancing ascent. 

Astounded, Darr Veter caught in the blue 
sounds an urge towards ever more complicat-
ed rhythms and forms and thought that the 
primitive struggle 
of 
life against entropy 
could not be better expressed. Steps, dams, 
filters holding back the cascades that were 
falling to lower levels of energy... To retain 

them for one moment and in the moment 
to live! So, so and so—there they were, those 
first splashes of the complicated organization 
of matter. 

Blue arrows resolved into a round dance 
of geometric figures, crystal and lattice forms 
that grew more complicated to the accompani-
ment of various combinations of minor ter-
cets, fell apart, were again combined and then 
suddenly 
dissolved 
in 
the 
grey 
twilight. 

The third movement began with the mea-
sured tread of bass notes in time with which 
blue lanterns were lit and extinguished as 
they moved off into the void of infinite space 
and time. The surge of tramping basses in-
creased, their rhythm grew faster until they 
merged into a broken, ominous melody. The 
blue lights were like flowers swaying on thin 
stems of fire—they bowed their heads sadly 
under the flood of low, thundering and blast-
ing notes and were extinguished in the distance. 
But the lines of lights or lanterns became 
denser and their stems were thicker. Then 
two fiery strips marked a road leading into 
immeasurable 
blackness and the 
resonant 
golden voices of life floated into the immense-
ness of the Universe, warming with a glor-
ious warmth gloomy, indifferent, ever-mov-
ing matter. The dark road changed to a river, 
a gigantic stream of blue flames in which 
splashes of multicoloured fire made a pattern 
that was constantly changing and becoming 
more intricate. 

The 
higher 
combinations 
of 
rounded, 
regular curves and spherical surfaces were of a 

beauty equal to that of the contradictory 
quartal chords, in the succession of which a 
complicated resonant melody increased rapid-
ly, whirling more powerfully and expansively 
in the rhythmical advance of the low rumble 
of time. 

Darr Veter's head was in a whirl and he 
could no longer 
follow all the shades of 
music and colour and was able to grasp only 
the general outline of the gigantic idea. The 
blue ocean of high notes, pure as crystal, 
glowed with a beaming, unusually powerful, 
joyful and clear colour. The tone rose higher 
and higher 
and the 
melody 
itself 
began 
rotating furiously in an ascending spiral until 
it broke off in flight, in a blinding flash of 
fire. 

The symphony was over and Darr Veter 
realized what he had been missing all these 
long months. He needed work that was closer 
to the Cosmos, closer to the tirelessly unwind-
ing spiral of human urge forward into the 
future. He went straight from the music room 
to the telephone room and from there called 
the 
Central 
Employment 
Bureau of 
the 
northern living zone. The young clerk who 
had sent him to work in the mines was 
pleased when he recognized him. 

"They called for you from the Astronauti-
cal 
Council 
this 
morning," 
he said, " b u t 1 
could not get in touch with you. I'll put 
you through now." 

The screen grew blank and then the light 
came on again and Mir Ohm, the senior of 
the four secretaries of the Council, appeared. 

His face wore a very serious look and, Darr 
Veter thought, a look mingled with sadness. 

"There 
has 
been 
a great 
catastrophe! 
Satellite 57 has perished! The Council is 
calling you for a most difficult job. 
I'll 
send an ion-powered planetship for you. Be 
ready to leave!" 

Darr Veter stood 
motionless 
in 
amazement 
in front of the already empty screen. 

Chapter Eight 

RED WAVES 

The wide verandah of the observatory was 
open to the winds that brought the perfume 
of flowering plants from the hot African coast 
across the sea, a perfume that aroused an ur-
gent yearning in a man's soul. Mven Mass 
could not compose himself into the state of 
clarity and firmness, when no doubts re-
mained, that was essential on the eve of a 
decisive experiment. Renn Bose has reported 
from Tibet that the Corr Yule installation had 
been reconstructed and was ready. The four 
observers on Satellite 57 had willingly agreed 
to risk their lives if that would help in 
carrying out an experiment such as Earth had 
never before known. 

The experiment, however, was being mount-
ed without the permission of the Council and 

without an extensive preliminary discussion 
of all possibilities. This made it seem like the 
secret manufacture of weapons in the darkest 
eras of man's history and gave it a flavour of 
cowardly secrecy not common to people of 
today. 

It is true that the great objective they 
hoped to reach seemed to justify the means, 
but ... they had to remain pure in spirit! The 
old human conflict between the end and the 
means of its attainment had arisen; and the 
experience 
of 
thousands 
of 
generations 
teaches mankind that there is a certain boun-
dary limiting the means to an end that must 
not be overstepped. 

The case of Beth Lohn gave the African no 
rest. Thirty-two years before, one of Earth's 
leading mathematicians Beth Lohn had dis-
covered that certain signs of displacement in 
the interaction of strong power fields could 
be explained by the existence of parallel 
dimensions. He carried out a series of interest-
ing experiments involving the disappearance 
of objects. The Academy of the Bounds of 
Knowledge found an error in his compu-
tations and produced an explanation of the 
observed phenomena that differed from his 
in principle. Beth Lohn, with his powerful 
mind hypertrophied at the expense of an 
underdeveloped sense of moral values and 
uninhibited 
desires, was a man 
of great 
strength and equally great egoism, who de-
cided to continue his experiments in his own 
way. To get convincing proofs he drew into 
the work courageous young volunteers who 

were willing to sacrifice themselves in the ser-
vice of science. The people in Beth Lohn's 
experiments disappeared as completely as 
the objects had done and, contrary to the 
hopes of the ruthless mathematician, not one 
of them made his presence known from "the 
other side" of the other dimension. When 
Beth Lohn had sent a group of twelve people 
into "non-existence", in other words had 
destroyed them, he was arraigned before the 
court. He succeeded in proving that he really 
believed his victims to be alive and somewhere 
in another dimension and that he had only 
acted with their consent; he was condemned 
to exile, spent ten years on Mercury and then, 
on returning to Earth, went to the Island of 
Oblivion, out of resentment for our world. 
Mven Mass felt that Beth Lohn's story was 
very much like his own; there, too, a secret 
experiment undertaken for objectives rejected 
by science had been forbidden and this was an 
analogy that Mven Mass did not like. 

In two days' time there would be a trans-
mission round the Great Circle and after 
that he would be free for eight days for the 
experiment! 

Mven Mass threw back his head to look at 
the sky. The stars seemed brighter and nearer 
than usual. Many of them he knew by their 
ancient names, knew them as old friends— 
and were they not, indeed, the age-old friends 
of man that had shown him his ways, given 
him 
lofty 
ideas and encouraged him 
to 
dream? 

A 
not-very-bright star inclining to the 

northern horizon was the Pole Star or Gamma 
Cephei. In the Era of Disunity the Pole Star 
had been in Ursa Minor, the Little Bear, but 
the revolution of the fringe of the Galaxy, 
and of the solar system with it, was in the 
direction 
of 
Cepheus. Cygnus, the Swan, 
one of the most interesting constellations in 
the northern sky, stretching through the Mil-
ky Way, had its long neck turned to the south. 
In this constellation there was a most beauti-
ful binary star that the ancient Arabs had 
named Albireo. It was afterwards discovered 
that there were really three stars, the binary 
Albireo I and Albireo II, a huge blue star 
with an extensive planetary system. They 
were almost as far from us as Deneb, the 
huge star in the Cygnus's tail with a luminosity 
equal to 4,800 of our suns. Only eight years 
before this a direct answer had been received 
from the inhabited worlds of the 
Deneb 
system to a message transmitted in the sec-
ond year of the Great Circle Era. During the 
last transmission our trusty friend 61 Cygni 
had received a message of warning from Al-
bireo II some 400 years after it had been sent 
but which was nevertheless of great interest. 
A famous Cosmic explorer from Albireo II 
whose name was transmitted in terrestrial 
sounds as Vlihh oz Ddiz, had been lost in the 
vicinity of the Lyra Constellation where he 
met one of the greatest dangers of the Cos-
mos, an Ookr star. Terrestrial scientists have 
placed these stars in class E so called in hon-
our of 
Einstein, the greatest physicist of 
ancient days, who predicted their existence 

although it was long disputed; the limit for 
the mass of a star was even determined and 
given the name of the Chandrasekhar Limit. 
But that ancient astronomer based his calcu-
lations exclusively on the mechanics of gravi-
tation and thermodynamics and did not take 
into consideration the intricate electromagne-
tic structure of the giant stars. It was precise-
ly these forces that conditioned the exis-
tence of E stars that in size rival the huge red 
M class giants like Antares of Betelgeuse but 
their density is greater, something like that of 
our Sun. The terrific gravitation of such bo-
dies prevented radiation so that light could 
not leave the star and travel through space. 
These inconceivably gigantic and mysterious 
masses had existed in space for an infinitely 
long time, secretly drawing into their inert 
ocean everything that came within reach of 
the inescapable tentacles of their 
gravity. 

There was a similar idea in ancient Indian 
religious mythology; the periods of the deity's 
inert repose were called the Nights of Brahma 
which alternated with his Days, the periods 
of creative activity. 

There were periods of the lengthy accumula-
tion of matter that later ended with the 
heating of the surface of the star until it 
reached class 0°; that is, reached a tempera-
ture of 100,000° C; at last there came the 
final explosion that hurled into space new 
stars with new planets, in the way the Crab 
Nebula once exploded and spread until it 
had a diameter of fifty billion kilometres. 

The explosion was equal in force to the 

explosion of a quadrillion of the murderous 
hydrogen bombs made in the Era of Disunity. 

The presence in space of absolutely dark 
stars of the E class could only be guessed by 
their gravitation and a spaceship whose course 
lay in the vicinity of the monster was doomed. 
The invisible infra-red stars of the T class also 
constituted a danger to spaceships; the same 
applied to dark clouds of big particles or 
absolutely cold bodies of the TT class. 

Mven Mass stood thinking that the estab-
lishment of the Great Circle linking up all 
the worlds inhabited by reasoning beings had 
been the greatest of all revolutions for Earth 
and, consequently, for all inhabited planets. 
Firstly, this had been a victory over time, over 
the shortness of the span of human life, that 
had prevented us and our thinking brothers 
in other worlds from penetrating into the 
farther depths of space. The transmission of 
information around the Great Circle was the 
transmission into an indefinite future since 
human thought, transmitted in this form, 
would continue its journey through space 
until it reached the farthest regions. The 
study of the most distant stars had become 
possible because the receipt of information 
from any place where there were planets 
that understood the Circle was only a matter 
of time. Only recently Earth received a mes-
sage from the huge but very distant star 
known as Gamma Cygni; the star is 2,800 par-
sees from us and a message takes over 9,000 
years to reach Earth but that which had been 
received was understandable and could be 

deciphered by those members of the Great 
Circle whose thought processes are similar. 
It is another matter if a message should come 
from globular stellar systems or clusters that 
are older than our flat systems. 

The same is true of the centre of the Gal-
axy—in its axial star-cloud there is a colossal 
zone of life on millions of planet systems that 
do not know the darkness of night for they 
are illuminated by the radiation of the centre 
of the Galaxy. Incomprehensible communi-
cations have been received from there, pic-
tures of intricate structures that cannot be 
expressed by any of our concepts. The Acad-
emy of the Bounds of Knowledge has been 
trying unsuccessfully to decipher them for 
eight hundred years. And yet, perhaps... The 
African's heart missed a beat at the sudden-
ness 
of the idea—reports from the nearer 
planet systems, members of the Great Circle, 
dealt with the internal life of each of the in-
habited planets, its science, technology, its 
works of art while the distant, ancient worlds 
of the Galaxy showed the external, 
Cosmic 
movement of their science and life. How they 
rearranged the 
planetary 
systems to 
suit 
themselves... How they sweep space clear of 
meteoroids that interfere with spaceships and 
dump them, together with cold planets un-
suited to life, into their central sun in order to 
lengthen the duration of its radiation or with 
the intention of increasing its heating effect. 
If that is not enough, perhaps they rearrange 
neighbouring planetary systems where the 
best conditions of life for gigantic civiliza-

tions are created... 

Half ironically, half seriously, Mven Mass 
got in touch with the Repository of Great 
Circle 
Records and selected the catalogue 
number of a distant message. The screen of 
his viewer was filled with strange pictures 
that had reached Earth from the globular 
cluster Omega Centauri. This cluster is the 
second nearest to the solar system and is only 
6,800 parsecs removed. Light from its bright 
stars travelled through outer space for 22,000 
years before reaching the eye of Earth-bound 
man. 

A dense blue haze spread in even layers 
that were pierced by vertical black cylinders 
rotating fairly rapidly. The contours of the 
cylinders 
were 
scarcely 
perceptible—from 
time to time they contracted until they were 
like squat cones with their bases joined. 
Then the blue haze would break up into fiery 
crescents that revolved madly about the axes 
of the cones. Blackness retreated into the 
heights, huge, dazzlingly white columns grew 
up and from behind them faceted points, 
green in colour, formed diagonal curtains... 

Mven Mass rubbed his forehead in an effort 
to grasp anything that made sense. 

On the screen the pointed green blades 
wound in spirals around the white columns 
and suddenly showered down 
in a stream 
of gleaming metal globes that lay in the form 
of a broad, circular belt. The belt began to 
grow in width and in height. Mven Mass 
smiled and switched off the record, returning 
to his former contemplation... 

Owing to the absence of populated worlds, 
or rather, to the absence of contact with them 
in the higher latitudes of the Galaxy, the 
people of Earth were still unable to get out 
of the equatorial belt of the Galaxy where 
space is darkened by fragments of matter and 
dust. We could not rise above the gloom in 
which our star and its neighbours are plunged. 
It was, therefore, difficult for us to learn 
about the Universe, even with the aid of the 
Great Circle. 

Mven Mass turned his eyes to the horizon, 
to the Coma Berenices Constellation lying 
below Ursa Major and under the Canes Ve-
natici. This was the North Pole of the Gala-
xy—in this direction lay the whole expanse of 
extragalactic space in the same way as at the 
opposite point of the sky, in the Piscis Austri-
nus Constellation, near the well-known star 
Fomalhaut, lay the South Pole of the galac-
tic system. In the outer region of the Galaxy, 
where our Sun is situated, the width of the 
branch of the spiral galactic disc is no more 
than 600 parsecs. Perpendicular to the plane 
of 
the 
galactic 
equator 
it 
was enough 
to 
cover a distance of 300—400 parsecs to rise 
above the level of the Galaxy's gigantic stel-
lar wheel. This route could not be covered 
by a spaceship but it was well within reach of 
Circle transmissions ... but ... so far not a 
single planet of any of the stars in those areas 
had joined the Circle. 

These 
eternal 
riddles 
and 
unanswered 
questions would have been turned into noth-
ing if another revolution, the greatest in 

science, could be achieved—if time could be 
conquered, if we could learn to overcome 
any distance in any span of time and enter 
the endless expanses of the Cosmos as its 
master. Then our Galaxy and other stellar 
islands would be no farther away from us 
than the tiny islands of the Mediterranean, 
against which the sea was splashing down 
below in the darkness of night. This was 
justification 
for 
the desperate experiment 
planned by Renn Bose and being put into ef-
fect by him, by Mven Mass, Director of the 
Outer Stations. If only they could give a bet-
ter scientific basis to their experiment and 
obtain the sanction of the Council... 

The lights of the Spiral Way changed colour 
from orange to white—2 a.m., the traffic peak. 
Mven Mass remembered that next day there 
would be the Fete of the Flaming Bowls 
to which Chara Nandi had invited him. The 
Director of the Outer Stations could not for-
get the reddish-bronze girl with her precisely 
supple movements that he had met on the 
beach. She was like a flower of sincerity and 
strong passions, rare enough in an epoch 
when feelings had been disciplined. 

Mven Mass went back to his study, called 
the Institute of Metagalactics, that worked 
at night, and asked them to send him stereote-
lefilms of a few galaxies next evening. Having 
obtained their consent he went up to the 
roof of the inner building where he kept his 
long-range 
leaping 
apparatus. 
Mven 
Mass 
was very fond of this unpopular sport and had 
achieved a fair degree of skill. He strapped 

the helium container to his body, leaped 
agilely into the air and for a second switched 
on a tractor propeller that was driven by a 
light accumulator. He described an arc about 
600 metres long and, landing on a ledge of the 
Catering House, repeated the jump. In five 
such leaps he reached a small garden under a 
limestone cliff where he landed on an alumi-
nium tower, removed the apparatus and slid 
down a pole to the ground and so to his hard 
bed standing under a huge plane-tree. 

The African 
fell asleep to the rustling of 
the leaves of the giant tree. 

The Fete of the Flaming Bowls got its 
name from the well-known poem by the poet-
historian Zann Senn in which he describes 
the ancient Indian custom of selecting the 
most beautiful women to carry swords and 
bowls containing flaming aromatic incense 
to heroes about to set out for the perfor-
mance of great deeds. Swords and bowls were 
no longer in use but remained as the symbol 
of heroism. Heroic deeds had grown to count-
less numbers amongst the bold and energetic 
population of the planet. A tremendous capac-
ity for work, possessed in the past by only 
those few people who were known as geniuses, 
depended entirely on the physical strength 
of the body and an abundance of hormone 
stimulators. 
Correct 
physical training 
for 
thousands of years had made the average 
person on the planet the equal of the heroes 
of antiquity, insatiable in his desire for heroic 
deeds, love and knowledge. 

The Fete of the Flaming Bowls was the 

women's spring festival. Every year in the 
fourth month after the winter solstice or, 
according to the old calendar, in April, the 
most beautiful women on Earth took part 
in dances, singing and gymnastics. The finest 
shades of beauty of the various races that 
showed in the mixed population of the planet 
were to be seen here in inexhaustible variety 
like the facets of a precious stone; they gave 
endless pleasure to their audiences which 
included everybody from scientists and engi-
neers, tired out with their meticulous labours, 
to inspired artists and the still youthful pupils 
of the Third Cycle schools. 

No less beautiful was the Festival of Her-
cules, the men's autumn festival celebrated 
in the ninth month. At this festival young 
men coming of age reported on the Hercu-
lean Labours they had performed. Later it be-
came the custom on these occasions to re-
view all the noteworthy deeds and achieve-
ments of the past year. And so the festival 
had become a general one, celebrated by both 
men and women, and lasting three days— 
the Day of Useful Excellence, the Day of 
Higher Art and the Day of Scientific Audacity 
and Fantasy. One year Mven Mass had been 
elected hero of the first and third days. 

Veda Kong sang a number of songs. Mven 
Mass appeared in the gigantic Solar Hall of 
the Tyrrhenian Stadium during her perfor-
mance. He found the ninth sector of the 
fourth radius where Evda Nahl and Chara 
Nandi were sitting and stood there in the 

shadow of an arcade listening to Veda's low 
deep voice. She was dressed in white. Her 
blonde head thrown back and her face turned 
to the upper galleries of the hall, she was 
singing a song of joy and to the African she 
seemed the very incarnation of spring. 

Every member of the audience pressed one 
of the four buttons in front of him. The 
golden, blue, emerald or red lights flickering 
on the ceiling showed the artist to what 
extent the performance had been appreciat-
ed and took the place of the noisy applause 
of former days. 

Veda finished singing and was awarded 
by a bright cluster of gold and blue lights 
amongst 
which 
the very few green ones 
were completely lost. Her face flushed with 
excitement as usual, she ran to her friends. 
At that moment they were joined by Mven 
Mass whom they heartily welcomed. 

The African looked round the stadium 
in search of his teacher and predecessor but 
Darr Veter was nowhere to be seen. 

"Where have you hidden Darr Veter?" he 
asked jokingly, turning to the three women. 

"And where have you hidden Renn Bose?" 
Evda Nahl replied, and the African hastily 
avoided her penetrating glance. 

"Veter is digging holes in South America," 
said the more kind-hearted Veda and a shad-
ow passed over her face. With a protective 
gesture Chara Nandi pulled Veda towards 
her, pressing her cheek against Veda's. The 
faces of the two women were vastly differ-
ent but possessed a gentle tenderness which 

lent them similarity. 

Chara's eyebrows, straight and low under 
a high forehead, resembled the outline of a 
soaring bird and were in perfect harmony 
with her long narrow eyes. Veda's eyebrows 
slanted upwards. 

" A bird flapping its wings," thought the 
African. 

Chara's thick, shining, black hair lay on 
her neck and shoulders contrasting sharply 
with Veda's fair hair, piled high on her head. 

Chara glanced at the clock in the domed 
roof and got up. 

Her 
dress 
astounded 
the 
African. 
On 
the girl's smooth shoulders lay a platinum 
chain leaving her high neck open. The chain 
was fastened below her throat by a gleaming 
red tourmaline. 

Her firm breasts, like wide upturned bowls 
carved with a very delicate chisel, were almost 
completely exposed. Between them, stretching 
from the tourmaline clasp to her belt ran a 
narrow strip of dark purple velvet. Similar 
strips, running across the middle of each breast, 
were held taut by the chain and joined on her 
bare back. The girl's very narrow waist was 
encircled by a white belt besprinkled with 
black stars and fastened by a platinum buckle 
in the form of a crescent, from which a strip of 
dark purple velvet hung down to her knees. 
Attached to her belt behind was what seemed 
like half a long skirt of heavy white silk, also 
decorated with black stars. The dancer wore 
no jewels with the exception of glittering 
buckles on her tiny black slippers. 

" I t will soon be my turn!" said Chara 
calmly making her way towards the arcade 
exit; she glanced at Mven Mass and disap-
peared, accompanied by whispered questions 
and thousands of curious glances. 

The stage was occupied by a gymnast, a 
beautifully proportioned girl no more than 
eighteen years old. In the golden floodlights, 
to the recitative of the music, she went through 
an amazingly rapid succession of leaps, springs 
and turns, balancing with unbelievable equili-
brium to slow, lyrical passages of music. 
The audience awarded her performance with a 
multitude of golden lights and Mven Mass 
thought that it would not be easy for Chara 
Nandi 
to 
dance 
after such a successful 
number. He looked anxiously at the faceless 
multitude of people opposite and suddenly 
noticed the artist Cart Sann sitting in the 
third sector. The latter greeted him with a 
gaiety that the African felt out of place—who, 
if not the artist who had painted Chara's 
picture as the Daughter 
of the 
Mediterranean, 
should have been perturbed at the outcome of 
her performance. 

The African was just thinking that after 
his experiment he would go to see the Daugh-
ter of 
the Mediterranean 
when the lights 
overhead were extinguished. The transparent 
floor of organic glass gleamed with the cherry-
red light of hot iron. Streams of red light 
poured out from under low footlights around 
the stage. The lights moved back and forth 
keeping time with the marked rhythm of the 
melody and merging with the resonant song 

of the violins and the low hum of bronze 
strings. Mven Mass was somewhat staggered 
by the power and tempestuousness of the 
music and did not immediately notice Chara 
as she appeared in the centre of that flaming 
floor and began her dance at a speed that 
took the onlookers' breath away. 

Mven Mass was afraid of what might hap-
pen if the music demanded still greater acce-
leration of the dance. She danced not only 
with her legs and arms—the girl's entire body 
responded to the blazing fire of the music 
with equally searing flames of life. The Afri-
can thought that if the women of ancient 
India had been like Chara, then the poet had 
been right in likening them to flaming bowls 
and in giving that name to the women's fete. 

Chara's reddish sunburn turned to a bright 
copper in the glow of the stage and the floor. 
Mven Mass's heart beat wildly. The woman 
he had seen on the fabulous planet of Epsilon 
Tucanae had skin of just that colour. At 
that time, also, he had learned there existed 
such a thing as the inspiration of a body ca-
pable of employing its movements, its delicate 
changes of beautiful forms, to express the 
most profound shades of feeling, fantasy 
and passion, to express a prayer for happi-
ness. 

Up to that moment he had known nothing 
but the urge to overcome the unattainable 
distance of ninety parsecs but now Mven Mass 
realized that flowers just as beautiful as the 
carefully nurtured picture of the distant plan-
et were to be found in the inexhaustible 

treasure-house of terrestrial beauty. But his 
long-cherished urge to achieve an unattain-
able dream did not pass so quickly. Chara's 
likeness to the red-skinned daughter in the 
world of 
Epsilon Tucanae only served to 
strengthen the determination of the Director 
of the Outer Stations. If so much joy was 
to be felt from one Chara Nandi what would 
the world be like where the majority of the 
women were like her?! 

Evda Nahl and Veda Kong, excellent dan-
cers themselves, were staggered at this, the 
first of Chara's dances that they had seen. 
Veda, anthropologist and specialist in the 
history of the ancient races, had come to the 
decision that in the past the women of Gond-
wana, the southern countries, had exceeded 
the men in number because men were often 
killed hunting dangerous wild beasts. Later 
when the despotic states of the 
Ancient 
East were established in the densely populat-
ed countries of the south, the men continued 
to be killed in wars, by religious excesses 
and by the whims of the despots. The daugh-
ters of the south went through a period of the 
strictest selection that 
developed the finer 
points of adaptation. In the north, where the 
population was scantier and nature less boun-
teous, there had not been such despotism 
in the Dark Ages. More men survived, women 
were more valued and lived a more dignified 
life. 

Veda followed Chara's every gesture and 
conceived the idea that in all her movements 
there was an amazing duality—they were at 

once gentle and predatory. The gentleness 
came from the graceful movements and un-
believable suppleness of the body and the pre-
datory impression was created by the abrupt 
changes, turns and poses that followed each 
other with the elusive rapidity that is natural 
in the wild beast. This feline litheness had 
been achieved by the dark-skinned daughters 
of Gondwana in the thousands of years of the 
struggle for 
existence through which the 
debased and enslaved women of the southern 
continents had lived ... but in Chara it was 
harmonically combined with the small firm 
features of a Creto-Hellenic face. 

The dissonant sounds of some percussion 
instruments merged in a short, slower adagio. 
The urgent, ever swifter rhythm of the rise 
and fall of human emotions was expressed in 
the dance by the alternation of movements 
full of meaning and their almost complete 
cessation when the dancer turned into a mo-
tionless statue. Slumbering emotions were 
aroused, flared up stormily, wilted in their 
exhaustion, died and were born again, stormy 
and untasted—life, 
fettered and struggling 
against the inevitable march of time, against 
the clear-cut, merciless definiteness of duty 
and fate. Evda Nahl felt that the psychologi-
cal basis of the dance was something so near 
to her that her cheeks became flushed and her 
breathing quickened. 

Mven Mass did not know that the composer 
had written the ballet suite specially for Cha-
ra Nandi, but he was no longer afraid of the 
wild tempo when he saw how well the girl 

was coping with it. Scarlet waves of light em-
braced her copper body, gave off crimson 
splashes from her strong legs, were drowned 
in the dark whirls of velvet and turned the 
white silk to the pink of dawn. Her arms, 
raised and thrown 
back, slowly 
ceased their 
motion over her head. Suddenly, without 
any finale, the music broke off in a stormy 
clangour of high notes and the red lights came 
to a standstill and were extinguished. The 
high dome of the building was flooded with 
its usual light. The tired girl bowed her head 
and her thick hair covered her face. The 
thousands of golden lights were followed by a 
dull noise. The audience were doing Chara the 
greatest of all honours—they were thanking 
her by 
standing up and stretching 
their 
clasped 
hands 
towards 
her. 
Chara, 
who, 
before the performance, had not known a 
tremor, lost her self-possession, threw back 
the hair from her face and ran away, after a 
glance towards the upper galleries. Mven Mass 
knew then why the artist had been so calm-
he knew his model. 

The Master of Ceremonies announced an 
entr'acte. 
Mven Mass hurried to look for 
Chara while Veda Kong and Evda Nahl went 
out on to the gigantic opaque glass stair-
case, a thousand metres wide, that led from 
the stadium down to the sea. The evening twi-
light, lucid and warm, tempted the two wom-
en 
to 
bathe, 
following 
the example 
of 
thousands of other spectators from the fete. 

"No wonder I was attracted to Chara Nandi 
the moment 
I saw her," said Evda Nahl. 

"She's a remarkable artist. Today we have 
seen the Dance of the Power of Life, in which 
is incorporated the best of everything that 
constitutes the foundation of the human soul 
and is frequently its ruler. That must con-
tain something of the erotic dances of the 
ancients!" 

"Now I understand Cart Sann, for beauty 
really 
is more important than we think. 
Beauty is the happiness and the meaning 
of life—how well he said that! And your de-
finition is a true one!" agreed Veda, kicking 
off a shoe and putting her foot into the warm 
water that splashed against the steps. 

" I t is a true one if the psychic forces are 
born of a healthy body full of energy," 
Evda Nahl corrected her as she removed her 
clothes and jumped into the transparent wa-
ter. Veda swam after her and they went 
together to a huge rubber island that shone 
silver about a mile away from the stadium. 
The flat surface of the island, level with the 
water, was surrounded by rows of shelters in 
the shape of shells of mother-of-pearl plas-
tic, big enough to screen three or four people 
from the sun and wind and to isolate them 
from their neighbours. 

The two women lay down on the soft, 
swaying floor of a "shell", breathing deeply 
of the eternally fresh smell of the sea. 

"You've got beautifully tanned since I met 
you on the beach!" said Veda looking at her 
companion. "Have you been at the seaside or 
does it come from sunburn pills?" 

"SB pills," admitted Evda. "I've been in 

the sun for only two days, yesterday and to-
day. I haven't got such wonderful skin as 
Chara Nandi." 

"Don't you really know where Renn Bose 
is?" continued Veda. 

"I know approximately and that is suffi-
cient to worry me!" answered Evda Nahl, 
softly. 

"Do you really want..." began Veda and 
then stopped but Evda lifted her lazily closed 
eyelids and looked her straight in the eyes. 

" I t seems to me that Renn Bose is some-
how ... helpless, like a young boy," Veda 
objected, hesitantly, "and you're so strong, 
you have an intellect that is the equal of 
any man's. One always feels that inside you 
there 
is a steel 
rod, your 
will-power..." 

"Renn Bose told me the same. But you're 
wrong in your estimation of him, you're as 
one-sided as Renn Bose himself. He is a man 
with a bold and powerful intellect and a terri-
fic capacity for work. Even today there are 
few to equal him on our planet. It is the com-
parison of his other qualities with his great ta-
lents that makes them seem undeveloped 
because they are just about the average or 
even puerile, perhaps. You were right in call-
ing Renn a boy, he is, but at the same time 
he's a hero in the true sense of the word. 
Take Darr Veter—there's something boylike in 
him, too, but with him it's just a super-
abundance of physical strength and not the 
lack of it, like it is with Renn." 

"What 
do you think of Mven?" 
Veda 
inquired. "Now that you know him better." 

"Mven Mass is a splendid combination of 
the cold intellect and the archaic fury of de-
sires. He is a man of great ability and is 
highly educated but at the same time he 
is 
the 
high priest 
of 
nature's 
elemental 
forces!" 

Veda Kong burst out laughing. 
"How I wish I could give such precise char-
acter studies!" 

"Psychology is my line," said Evda, shrug-
ging her shoulders. "But let me ask you a 
question. Do you know that Darr Veter is a 
man that I like very much?" 

"You're afraid of half-formed decisions?" 
Veda blushed. "No, this time there will be no 
fatal 
half-way 
decisions 
and 
insincerity. 
Everything is as clear as crystal..." 
Under 
the penetrating glance of the psychiatrist, 
Veda continued: 

"Erg Noor .... our ways parted long ago. I 
could not give way to a new feeling as long 
as he was in the Cosmos, I could not draw 
myself away and so weaken the strength of 
my hopes, my faith in his return. Now it is 
only a case of precise calculation and confi-
dence. Erg Noor knows everything but is 
going his own way." 

Evda Nahl placed her slender arm round 
Veda's shoulder. "So it's Darr Veter?" 

"Yes," answered Veda, firmly. 
"Does he know?" 
"No. 
Later, when Tantra arrives... Isn't 
it time for us to go back?" 

"I have to leave the fete," said Evda Nahl, 
"my holiday is finished. I have a big job to 

do in the Academy of Sorrow and Joy, and I 
must see my daughter before I go there." 

"Is she a big girl?" 
"Seventeen. My son is older. I have done 
the duty of every woman who is normally de-
veloped and has normal heredity—two chil-
dren, no less! Now I want a third one—but I 
want him grown up!" Evda Nahl smiled and 
her serious face was lit up with the tenderness 
of love, her bow-shaped upper lip lifted slight-
ly. 

"I imagine a fine, big-eyed boy with such 
a loving and 
ever-astonished mouth ... with 
freckles and a snub nose," said Veda slyly, 
looking straight in front of her. Her compa-
nion, after a short pause, asked her: 

"Have you got any new job yet?" 
"No, I'm waiting for Tantra, then there 
will be a big expedition." 

"Then come with me to visit my daughter," 
suggested Evda, and Veda gladly consented. 

The whole of one wall of the observatory 
was taken up with a seven-metre hemispheri-
cal screen for the demonstration of films and 
photos taken by powerful telescopes. Mven 
Mass switched on a general view of a section 
of the sky near the North Pole of the Galaxy, 
the meridional strip of constellations from 
Ursa Major to Corvus and Centaurus. In this 
part, in Canes Venatici, Coma Berenices and 
Virgo there were many galaxies, islands of 
stars in the form of flat wheels or discs. An 
especially large number of them had been 
discovered in Coma Berenices—separate gala-

xies, of regular and irregular form, showing 
different degrees of revolution and projec-
tion, some of them inconceivably far away, at 
a distance of thousands of millions of parsecs, 
often forming whole "clouds" of tens of 
thousands of galaxies. The biggest of the gala-
xies are anything from 20,000 to 50,000 
parsecs in diameter, like the stellar island or 
Galaxy NN 89105 + SB 23, in the old days 
known as M 31, or the Andromeda Nebula. 
This little, faintly gleaming, nebulous cloud 
could be seen from Earth with the naked 
eye. Long before this people had discovered 
the secret of this cloud. The nebula proved 
to be a gigantic, wheel-shaped stellar system 
one and a half times the size of our huge 
Galaxy. The study of the Andromeda Nebula, 
despite the fact that it was 450,000 parsecs 
distant from terrestrial observers, did much 
to help gain knowledge of our own Galaxy. 

Mven Mass remembered from childhood 
the magnificent photographs of the various 
galaxies that had been obtained by means of 
electron inverted pictures or by radio tele-
scopes such as the gigantic Pamir and Patago-
nia installations, each of them almost 400 
kilometres in diameter, that penetrated even 
deeper 
into 
the 
Cosmos. 
The 
galaxies, 
monster clusters of billions of cellestial bodies 
separated by distances of millions of parsecs, 
had always aroused in him an irrepressible 
desire to know the laws of their constitution, 
the story of their origin and their further 
evolution. The main thing that intrigued every 
inhabitant of Earth was the possibility of 

there being life on the countless planetary 
systems in these islands of the 
Universe, 
the question of the fires of thought and 
knowledge that burned there, of human civ-
ilizations in those infinitely distant spaces 
of the Cosmos. 

Three stars appeared on the screen that 
the ancients had named Alphcratz, Mirach 
and Almak (a, (5, y Andromedae), arranged 
in an ascending straight line. On either side of 
this line were the two galaxies close to each 
other, the 
Andromeda 
Nebula or M 31, 
and the beautiful spiral of M 33 in the Trian-
gulum Constellation. Mven Mass changed the 
metal film. 

He was now looking at the galaxy known 
in ancient days as M 51, in the Canes Vena-
tici, 800,000 parsecs away. This was one of 
the few galaxies that we see "flat", our line 
of sight being perpendicular to the plane of 
the "wheel". It has a very bright, dense core 
made up of countless millions of stars from 
which two spiral arms stretch out, each of 
them with similarly dense star clusters at the 
beginning. Their long ends seem to get fainter 
and more nebulous until they disappear into 
the darkness of space, stretching for tens of 
thousands of parsecs from each other in 
opposite directions. Between the arms, or 
main branches, there are short streams of 
stellar condensations and clouds of luminous 
gas alternating with black "voids", accumula-
tions of dark matter; the bright arms are all 
curved like the blades of a turbine. 

The huge galaxy NGK 4565 in the Coma 

Berenices Constellation was a very beautiful 
one. At a distance of a million parsecs it was 
seen edgeways. Leaning over to one side, like 
a soaring bird, the Galaxy spread its thin 
disc, apparently consisting of spiral branches, 
over a huge area; the central core was a great-
ly oblate spheroid that burned brightly and 
had the appearance of a solid gleaming mass. 
It could be clearly seen that the islands of 
stars were so flat that the Galaxy could be 
compared to a thin wheel belonging to some 
clockwork 
mechanism. 
The edges of 
the 
wheel were indistinct, they seemed to merge 
into the bottomless void. Our Sun is located 
on just such an edge of a galaxy together 
with a tiny speck of dust called Earth that, 
linked by the power of knowledge with many 
inhabited worlds, is spreading the wings of 
human thought over the infinity of the Cos-
mos. 

Mven Mass then switehed the projector 
over to the galaxy NGK 4594 in the Virgo 
Constellation; this galaxy, also visible in its 
equatorial plane, had always interested him. 
It stood at a distance of ten million parsecs 
from Earth and resembled a thick lentil of 
burning stellar material wrapped in a layer 
of luminescent gas. A thick black line, a con-
densation of dark material, cut the lentil 
along its equator. The galaxy looked like a 
mysterious lantern shining out of an enor-
mous abyss. 

What worlds were hidden there, in a galaxy 
whose total radiation was brighter than that 
of other galaxies and averaged that of an F 

class star? Were there any mighty inhabited 
planets there? Was thought there also grappl-
ing with the mysteries of nature? 

The fact that the huge clusters of stars 
did not answer made Mven Mass clench his 
fists. He realized the terrific distances in-
volved—light from the Galaxy he was looking 
at travelled thirty-two million years to reach 
Earth. 
Sixty-four 
million years would be 
required to exchange information! 

Mven Mass selected another reel and on the 
screen there appeared a big, bright, round 
patch of light amongst dispersed, faint stars. 
An irregular black strip cut the patch in two, 
making the brightly gleaming fiery masses 
on either side of it still brighter by contrast 
and thickening towards its ends and over-
shadowing an extensive field of the burning 
gas that formed a ring round the bright 
patch. 
This 
was a 
picture 
of 
colliding 
galaxies in the Cygnus Constellation that had 
been obtained by the most remarkably in-
genious technical set-ups. This collision of 
giant galaxies, each equal in size to 
our 
Galaxy or to the Andromeda Nebula, had 
long been known as a source of radio emana-
tion, probably the most powerful in the part 
of the Universe that we could probe. Rapid-
ly moving gas streams of colossal size set up 
electromagnetic fields of such inconceivable 
power that they sent out news of the titanic 
catastrophe 
to 
all ends of the 
Universe. 
Matter itself sent out this alarm signal from a 
radio station with a power of a quintillion 
megawatts. So great was the distance to the 

galaxies, however, that the picture on the 
screen showed its state millions of years 
before. The present state of these two gala-
xies, passing one through the other, will be 
known on Earth such a long time after that 
we cannot say whether terrestrial man will 
continue 
to 
exist so unimaginably 
long. 

Mven Mass jumped up and leaned on the 
table with both hands so hard that the joints 
cracked. 

Transmission periods of millions of years, 
covering tens of thousands of human gene-
rations and which actually amount to that 
"never" that is killing to scientific thought, 
could disappear at the wave of a magic wand— 
Renn Bose's discovery and their joint experi-
ment! 

Inconceivably distant points of the Uni-
verse would be within reach! 

Astronomers in ancient days believed the 
galaxies to be moving apart. The light that 
reached terrestrial telescopes from distant 
stellar islands had been changed, light oscilla-
tions had lengthened, turning to red waves. 
This reddening of the light was taken as evi-
dence that the galaxies were receding from 
the observer. People in the past were accus-
tomed tq a direct, one-sided conception of 
phenomena and they created the theory of a 
Universe that was moving apart or exploding, 
not realizing that they saw only one side of 
the magnificent process of destruction and 
creation. It was this one aspect—dispersion 
and destruction, that is, the transition of 
energy to a lower level in accordance with 

the second law of thermodynamics—that was 
conceivable to us and was recorded by instru-
ments constructed to sharpen our senses. 
The other aspect—accumulation, concentra-
tion and creation—was outside man's concepts 
because life acquired its strength from energy 
diffused by the stars, the suns, and our con-
ception of the surrounding Universe took 
shape on the basis of this. Man's mighty brain, 
however, penetrated even into the hidden 
processes of the creation of worlds and of 
our Universe. But in those distant times it 
still seemed that the greater the distance to a 
galaxy the greater the speed of its motion 
away from the terrestrial observer. As man 
penetrated farther into outer space he found 
galaxies with velocities close to that of light. 
The end of the visible Universe was the point 
where galaxies seemed to have reached that 
velocity 
although actually 
no 
light 
from 
them could have reached us and we should 
not have seen them... 

We now know why the light from these 
galaxies is red. As is usually the case in science 
there proved to be more than one cause—it 
is not only due to their recession from us. The 
only light that reaches us from distant stellar 
.slands is that radiated by their brightest 
centres. These huge masses of matter are 
encircled 
by annular 
electromagnetic fields 
that strongly affect light rays, not only by 
their intensity but also on account of the 
area they cover; they gradually slow down the 
light waves until they become longer red 
waves. In very ancient times astronomers 

knew that light from very dense stars turns 
red, the spectral lines shifting towards the 
red end, so that the star seems to be reced-
ing like, for example, the second component 
of Sirius, the white dwarf Sirius B. The 
farther away the galaxy, the more centralized 
is the radiation that reaches us and the stron-
ger the concentration at the red end of the 
spectrum. 

During a very long journey through space 
light waves, on the other hand, are "shaken 
up" and the light quanta lose part of their 
energy. This phenomenon 
has now been 
studied—the red waves may also be fatigued 
"old" 
waves of ordinary light. Even light 
waves that penetrate everywhere "grow old" 
from their journey over tremendous distan-
ces. What hope had man of overcoming such 
distances unless he attacks gravitation itself 
by means of its opposite, following Renn 
Bose's calculations? 

His anxiety 
was fading away! 
He was 
doing the right thing by carrying out the un-
precedented experiment! 

Mven Mass, as usual, went out on the 
observatory 
verandah 
and 
began 
walking 
swiftly up and down. The distant galaxies 
still shone in his tired eyes, galaxies that sent 
waves of red light to Earth like signals calling 
for help, like appeals to the all-conquering 
thought of man. Mven Mass laughed softly 
and confidently. These red rays would be-
come as familiar to man as those at the Fete 
of the Flaming Bowls that had wrapped Chara 
Nandi's body in the red light of life—Chara, 

who had appeared to him unexpectedly as 
the copper daughter of 
Epsilon Tucanae, 
the girl of his impossible dreams. 

And he would direct Renn Bose's vector 
precisely at Epsilon Tucanae, not merely in 
the hope of seeing that wonderful world, 
but also in honour of her, of its terrestrial 
representative! 

Chapter Nine 

A T H I R D C Y C L E SCHOOL 

Third Cycle School No. 410 was situated 
in Southern Ireland. Broad fields, vineyards 
and oak groves ran down the slopes of the 
green hills to the very sea. Veda Kong and 
Evda Nahl arrived when the children were 
still in class; they walked along a corridor 
running round classrooms on the perimeter 
of a circular building. The day was dull with a 
drizzle of rain so that all classes were being 
held indoors instead of out in the open as 
was more usual. 

Veda Kong felt like a schoolgirl again as she 
crept up to listen at the entrances to the class-
rooms which, as in the majority of schools, 
were without doors and shut off by overlapp-
ing projecting walls. Evda Nahl joined in the 
game and the two women peeped into class 

after class in an attempt to find Evda's daugh-
ter and remain unnoticed themselves. 

In the first classroom they saw a drawing 
in blue chalk covering the whole length of one 
wall: it showed a vector that was encircled by 
a spiral unfolding along it. Two sections of 
the spiral were encircled by transverse ellip-
ses in which a system of rectangular coordi-
nates was inscribed. 

"Bipolar mathematics!" exclaimed Veda in 
mock horror. 

"This is something more than that! Wait 
a minute!" said Evda. 

"Now that we know something about the 
shadow functions of the cochlear, or spiral 
progressive movement, that occurs along the 
vector," the elderly teacher with deep-set, 
blazing eyes, thickened one of the lines with 
his chalk, "we are close to understanding the 
repagular calculus. The name of the calculus 
comes from the ancient Latin word 'repa-
gulum', a barrier or obstacle, and it is the 
transition 
from 
one 
quality 
to 
another, 
seen in a two-sided aspect." The teacher 
pointed to an extensive ellipse across the spi-
ral. "In other words, it is the mathematical 
analysis of mutually transitional phenome-
/1 

na... 

Veda Kong disappeared behind the outjut-
ting wall, pulling her companion after her. 

"That's 
something new! 
It's from 
that 
branch of mathematics Renn Bose was talk-
ing to us about down on the seashore." 

"The school always gives its pupils the 
newest of everything and discards whatever 

is outworn. If new generations repeat old 
conceptions how can we expect to ensure rap-
id progress? As it is, a terrible amount of 
time elapses before a child takes its place in 
the relay race of knowledge. It takes dozens 
of years for a child to become fully educated 
and ready to undertake gigantic tasks. This 
pulsation of the generations, where you take 
one step forward and nine-tenths backward-
backward while the next shift in the relay 
is learning—is that most difficult of all biologi-
cal laws for man, the law of death and renas-
cence. Much of what we learned in mathema-
tics, physics and biology is already out of 
date. Your history is different, it grows old 
more slowly because it is very old itself." 

They 
glanced into 
another 
room. 
The 
schoolmistress, standing with her back to 
them, and the interested children, did not 
notice them. The attentive faces of the pu-
pils—they were young men and women seven-
teen years of age, in the higher classes of the 
Third Cycle School—and their burning cheeks 
told how thrilled they were with the lesson. 

"We, the human race, have passed through 
many trials," the voice of the teacher re-
sounded with excitement, "and the 
most 
important thing in your school history is 
the study of the historic mistakes made by 
man and their consequences. We have passed 
through the stage of the unbearable compli-
cation of life and things used by man and 
have 
arrived 
at 
extreme 
simplicity. 
The 
complication of life led dialectically to the 
simplification of spiritual culture. There must 

not be any unnecessary complications to tie 
man up, his experiences and perceptions are 
finer when he leads a simple life. Everything 
relating to everyday life is studied by the best 
brains as befits important scientific problems. 
We have followed the general line of de-
velopment of the animal kingdom which was 
directed towards the liberation of attention 
by making movements automatic and de-
veloping reflexes in the work of the nervous 
system. The automation of the productive 
forces of society created an analogous reflex 
system of control in production economy and 
released many people for what is now man's 
chief occupation— scientific research. Nature 
has provided us with a big brain capable of 
scientific inquiry although at first it was only 
used to search for food and investigate its 
edibility." 

"Very good!" whispered Evda Nahl and at 
that moment noticed her daughter. The girl 
did 
not suspect anything and sat staring 
in contemplation at the corrugated glass that 
prevented the pupils from seeing what was 
going on outside the classroom. 

Veda Kong was curious to compare 
her 
with her mother. They had the same long 
straight hair, the daughter's plaited with a 
blue thread and tied up in two big loops. 
Both had the same oval face, narrow at the 
chin and somewhat babyish from the too 
high 
forehead 
and 
the 
high 
cheekbones 
protruding below the temples. A snow-white 
sweater of artificial wool stressed the dark 
paleness of the girl's skin and the acute 

blackness 
of 
her 
eyes, 
eyebrows 
and 
eyelashes. A necklace of red coral harmo-
nized with the girl's unquestionably original 
appearance. 

Evda's daughter, like all other pupils, wore 
wide shorts, hers differing only in a red fringe 
that was stitched into the seams. 

" A n 
American 
Indian ornament," whis-
pered Evda Nahl in answer to her friend's in-
quiring glance. 

Evda and Veda just had time to step back 
into the corridor when the teacher left the 
room 
followed 
by several pupils, 
Evda's 
daughter amongst them. The girl stopped 
suddenly in her track as she noticed her 
mother, her pride and an example to be fol-
lowed. Although Evda did not know it, there 
was a circle of her admirers in the school, 
youngsters who had decided to take the same 
road in life as she had taken. 

"Mother!" whispered the girl, casting a shy 
glance 
at 
her 
mother's 
companion 
and 
clinging to Evda. 

The 
teacher 
stopped 
and 
then 
came 
over to them, giving them a nod of greet-
ing. 

" I must inform the school council," she 
said, disregarding Evda's gesture of protest, 
"we must gain something from your visit." 

"Better take advantage of her visit," said 
Evda as she introduced Veda Kong. 

The history teacher blushed deeply and 
looked like a young girl. 

"That's fine!" she said, trying to keep her 
tone business-like. "The school is about to 

graduate the senior groups and a word from 
Evda Nahl to send them on their way coupled 
with a review of the ancient cultures and races 
from Veda Kong will be something for our 
youth to remember! Won't it, Rhea?" 

Evda's daughter clapped her hands. The 
teacher ran with the light gait of a gymnast 
to the subsidiary premises, contained in a 
long straight building. 

"Rhea, can you cut out the polytechnics 
lesson today and come for a walk?" Evda 
suggested to her daughter. " I shan't be able 
to see you again before you have to choose 
your matriculation tasks. Last time we didn't 
come to a decision." 

Rhea did not answer but took her mother's 
hand. In each of the school cycles the lessons 
were interspersed with polytechnics. At the 
moment they were to have one of Rhea's 
favourite occupations, the grinding of opti-
cal lenses, but what could be more interest-
ing or more important than her mother's 
arrival? 

Veda went away to a little observatory 
that she could see in the distance, leaving 
mother and daughter alone. Rhea, clasping 
her mother's strong arm like a child, walked 
beside her wrapped in thought. 

"Where's your little 
Kay?" asked Evda 
and the girl grew noticeably sad. Kay had 
been a ward of hers—the older schoolchildren 
paid regular visits to first and second cycle 
schools in their vicinity to help with the teach-
ing and upbringing of wards they had select-
ed. 
Integrated 
help for the teachers was 

absolutely essential to ensure thoroughness 
of education. 

"Kay was promoted to the second cycle 
and has gone far away from here. It's such a 
pity ... why do they move us from place to 
place every four years, when we are pro-
moted to the next cycle?" 

"The psyche is wearied and becomes slug-
gish where there is a uniformity of impres-
sions and perception becomes duller. The 
efficiency of teaching and upbringing grows 
less year by year. That is why the twelve 
years of schooling are divided into three 
four-year cycles and you move to another 
school after every cycle, each time to a differ-
ent part of the planet. It is only the babies 
in the zero cycle, from one to four years, 
that do not need any change of place and 
conditions of upbringing." 

"And why does each cycle have separate 
schools and separate living quarters?" 

"As you little people grow up and are 
trained you become qualitatively different 
beings. If different age groups live together 
it makes their training more difficult and is 
annoying 
to 
the 
youngsters 
themselves. 
We have reduced the differences to a mini-
mum by dividing the children into three age 
groups, but this is still not a perfect system. 
The first cycle, for example, obviously needs 
splitting into two groups, and that will soon 
be done. But let us talk first about your 
affairs and your dreams for the future. I 
shall have to deliver a lecture to all of you and 
may 
be able to answer your 
questions." 

Rhea 
began to confide 
her 
innermost 
thoughts to her mother with the frankness of 
a child of the Great Circle Era who had never 
experienced 
hurtful 
ridicule 
or 
misunder-
standing. The girl was the incarnation of 
youth that as yet knew nothing of life but 
was full of contemplative anticipation. At 
the age of seventeen the girl was finishing 
school and starting her three-year period of 
matriculation tasks, working amongst adults. 
After the tasks her interests and abilities 
would be clearly defined. A two-year higher 
education would follow that would give her 
the right to independent work in the chosen 
field. In the course of a long life a man or 
woman had time to take higher educational 
courses in five or six different fields, changing 
work from time to time, but a great deal 
depended on the choice of the first diffi-
cult tasks—the Labours of Hercules, or matri-
culation tasks. They were chosen after long 
contemplation and always following the ad-
vice of older people. 

"Have you passed the graduation psycholo-
gical tests yet?" asked Evda. 

"Yes, I got 20 and 24 in the first eight 
groups, 18 and 19 in the tenth and thirteenth 
and even 17 in the seventeenth!" exclaimed 
Rhea proudly. 

"That's wonderful!" said Evda in pleased 
tones. "Everything is open to you. Have you 
stuck to the choice you made for the first 
task?" 

"Yes, I'm going to be a nurse on the Island of 
Oblivion, and then all our circle is going to 

work at the Jutland Psychological Hospital." 

Rhea told her mother about the circle of 
her "followers". Evda had plenty of good-
natured jokes to make about these zealous 
psychologists 
but 
nevertheless 
Rhea 
persuaded her mother to be mentor for the 
members of the group who were also at the 
time selecting their tasks. 

" I shall have to live here until the end of 
my holiday," laughed Evda, "and what will 
Veda Kong do?" 

The girl suddenly remembered her mother's 
companion, 

"She's very nice," said Rhea, seriously, 
"and almost as beautiful as you are!" 

"She's much more beautiful!" 
"No, I know ... and it's not because you're 
my mother," said the girl, bashfully. "Per-
haps she's better at first glance but you 
have a spiritual tabernacle within you that 
Veda Kong hasn't yet got. I don't say she 
won't have, it's just that she hasn't built it 
yet... but she'll build it and then..." 

"Then she'll outshine your mother like a 
moon outshines the stars." 

Rhea shook her head. 
"And are you going to stand still? You'll 
go farther than she!" 

Evda passed her hand over the girl's smooth 
hair and looked down into her upturned face. 

"Isn't that enough eulogy, daughter? We're 
wasting time!" 

Veda Kong walked slowly down an avenue 
that led her deeper into a grove of broad-

leaved maples, whose heavy moist foliage 
rustled dully. The first wraiths of the evening 
mist were making an effort to rise from a near-
by 
meadow but they were instantly dis-
persed by the wind. Veda Kong was pondering 
over the mobile tranquillity of nature and 
thinking that the sites for the schools were 
always so well chosen. The development of a 
keen perception of nature and a sensitive 
communion with nature were an important 
part of the child's training. Dulled interest in 
nature is, in actual fact, an impediment to 
man's development, for one who has forgot-
ten how to observe will soon lose the ability 
to generalize. Veda thought about the ability 
to teach, the most important of all compe-
tencies in the age when they had at last 
learned that upbringing was more important 
than education and was the only way to pre-
pare the child for the difficult job of being 
a real man. The basis, of course, is provided 
by inherent abilities but they might easily 
be left undeveloped, without that chiselling 
of the human spirit that is done by the peda-
gogue. 

Veda's mind turned back to those distant 
days when she had been a third cycle school-
girl, a mass of contradictions, burning with 
the desire to sacrifice herself and at the same 
time judging the world by herself alone, 
with all the egocentrism of healthy youth. 
How much the teachers did for her in those 
days—in truth there is no loftier profession in 
this world of ours than that of a teacher! 

The future of mankind is in the hands of 

the teacher for it is only by his efforts that 
man rises ever higher and becomes more and 
more powerful, coping with the most arduous 
of all tasks, that of overcoming himself, his 
greedy self-love and his unbridled desires. 

Veda Kong turned towards a small bay sur-
rounded by pines where she could hear the 
sounds of youthful voices; soon she came 
upon a dozen boys in plastic aprons busily 
trimming an oak beam with axes, instruments 
that had been invented as far back as the 
stone age. The young builders greeted the his-
torian respectfully and explained to her that 
they wanted to build a vessel without the 
aid of automatic saws and other machinery, in 
the same way as the heroes of ancient days 
had done. The ship, when built, was to take 
them to the ruins of Carthago, a trip they 
wanted to make during their vacation, accom-
panied by the teachers of geography, history 
and polytechnics. 

Veda wished them success and intended to 
continue on her way. A tall, thin lad with 
absolutely 
yellow 
hair 
stepped 
forward. 

"You came here with Evda Nahl, didn't 
you? Then may I ask you a couple of ques-
tions?" 

Veda laughingly consented. 
"Evda Nahl works at the Academy of 
Sorrow and Joy. We have studied the social 
organization of our planet and of several 
other worlds, but we have not been told the 
significance of that Academy." 

Veda told them of the great census conduct-
ed by the Academy to compute sorrow and 

happiness in the lives of individuals and in-
vestigate sorrow by age groups. It was fo-
llowed by an analysis of sorrow and joy for all 
the stages of the historical development of 
mankind. 
No matter what qualitative dif-
ferences there may have been in emotions, 
the sum totals, investigated by big number 
stochastic24 methods, showed some impor-
tant regularities. The Councils that directed 
the further development of society did their 
utmost to correct any worsening and ensure 
improvement. Only when joy predominated, 
or at least counterbalanced sorrow, was it 
considered that society was developing suc-
cessfully. 

"And so the Academy of Sorrow and Joy 
is the most important?" asked another boy, 
one with bold eyes. The others smiled and 
the boy who had first spoken to Veda Kong 
explained what they were laughing at. 

"Oil always wants to be the most impor-
tant. He dreams about the great leaders of 
the past..." 

"That's a dangerous thing to do," smiled 
Veda. "As an historian I can tell you that the 
great leaders were people who were them-
selves tied hand and foot and very dependent." 

"Tied up by the conventionalism of their 
actions?" 
asked 
the 
yellow-haired 
boy. 

"Exactly. But you must remember that 
that was in the unevenly and spontaneously 
developing ancient societies of the Era of 
Disunity or even earlier. Today, leadership 
is invested in each of the Councils and is 
expressed by the fact that the action of all 

the others is impossible without it." 

"What 
about 
the 
Economic 
Council? 
Without 
that Council nobody can under-
take anything big," Oil objected cautiously, 
somewhat abashed but still not confused. 

"That's true because economics is the only 
real basis of our existence. But it seems to 
me that you don't have quite the right idea 
of what constitutes leadership. Have you 
studied the cytoarchitectonics 
of the hu-
man brain?" 

The boys said that they had. 
Veda took a stick from one of them and 
in the sand drew circles to represent the 
administrative bodies. 

"Here 
in 
the centre 
is the 
Economic 
Council. We will draw direct links from it 
to 
the consultative bodies: the ASJ, the 
Academy of Sorrow and Joy; the APF, the 
Academy of Productive Forces; the ASP, the 
Academy of Stochastics and Prognostication; 
the APL, the Academy of the Psychophysio-
logy of Labour. There is lateral connection 
with the Astronautical Council, a body that 
functions 
independently. 
From 
the 
latter 
there is direct communication with the ADR, 
the Academy of Directed Radiation, and the 
Outer Stations of the Great Circle. Further..." 

Veda drew an intricate diagram in the sand 
and continued: 

"Isn't that just like the human 
brain? 
The research and registration centres are the 
sensory nerve centres. The Councils are the 
associative centres. You know that all life 
consists of the dialectics of attraction and 

repulsion, the rhythm of dispersal and accu-
mulation, excitation and inhibition. The chief 
inhibition centre is the Economic Council 
that 
translates everything into the actual 
possibilities of the social organism and its 
objective laws. Our brain and our society, 
both of which are persistently advancing, 
have this dialectic interplay of opposing for-
ces brought into harmonic action. There was 
a time, long ago, when this was incorrectly 
termed cybernetics, or the science of control, 
in an attempt to reduce the most intricate 
interplay 
of 
inhibitions 
to 
the 
relatively 
simple functioning of a machine. That at-
tempt, however, was due to ignorance; the 
greater the knowledge we acquired the more 
complicated we found the phenomena and 
laws of thermodynamics, biology, and eco-
nomics, and simplified conceptions of nature 
or the processes of social development disap-
peared for ever." 

The boys listened to Veda spellbound. 
"What is the chief thing in such a social 
structure?" she asked the lover of "chiefs" 
and "leaders". He was so put out that he 
could not think of an answer and the first 
boy came to his rescue. 

"Its 
forward movement!" 
he answered, 
boldly. 

" A prize for such an excellent answer!" 
exclaimed Veda admiringly; she looked at her-
self and then took an enamel brooch, depicting 
an albatross over the blue sea, from her left 
shoulder. She offered it to the lad on the 
palm of her hand. He was shyly hesitant. 

"As a reminder of today's talk and ... of 
forward movement!" Veda insisted and the 
lad took the albatross. 

Holding up the blouse that was slipping 
from her shoulder Veda made her way back 
through 
the 
park. The brooch had been 
a present from Erg Noor and her sudden 
urge to give it away meant a lot—amongst 
other things it meant a strange desire to get 
rid of the past as quickly as possible, to get 
rid of what had been or was being left be-
hind... 

The entire population of the school town 
gathered in the round hall in the centre of 
the school building. Evda Nahl, in a black 
dress, stood on the central dais, illuminated 
from above, calmly studying the rows of 
people in the audience. The people main-
tained perfect silence, listening to her clear 
but not loud voice. Screaming loudspeakers 
were used only for safety precautions and 
large halls had ceased to be necessary since 
the stereoscopic 
televisophone 
(TVP) 
had 
come into general use. 

"Seventeen is the turning point in life. 
Soon you will 
pronounce the traditional 
words at a meeting of the Irish Educational 
Division: 

" 'You, my elders, who have called me to 
a life of endeavour, accept my ability and my 
desire, accept my labour and teach me by day 
and by night. Hold out to me the hand of 
help, for the road is a hard one, and I will 
follow you.' 

" A very great deal is understood between 
the lines of this ancient formula and that is 
what I am going to talk about today. 

"From childhood you have been taught 
the philosophy of dialectics that long ago, 
in the secret books of the ancients, was called 
the Secret of Duality. 
It was believed that 
its power could only be achieved by the 
initiated—mentally 
and 
morally 
lofty and 
strong individuals. From childhood you have 
looked upon the world through the laws of 
dialectics and its mighty strength is now at 
everybody's service. You have been born into 
a well-ordered society created by countless 
generations of unknown toilers and those 
who struggled for a better life in the dark 
ages of cruelty and tyranny. Five hundred 
generations have passed since the formation 
of the first society with a division of labour. 
In the course of that time the various races 
and nations of 
the globe 
have 
mingled. 
Every one of us has drops of blood, or, as 
we should say today, the mechanics of here-
dity, in him from each of those peoples. 
A tremendous amount of work has been 
done to purge heredity of the consequences 
of 
the 
incautious handling of 
radioactive 
materials and from the diseases that were 
formerly widespread and interfered with it. 

"The upbringing of the new man is an elab-
orate task involving personal analysis and a 
very cautious approach to each individual. 
The time has gone beyond recall when society 
could be satisfied with people who had been 
brought up casually, whose 
insufficiencies 

were excused by heredity or by man's in-
herent nature. Every badly brought up person 
is today a reproach to the whole community, 
a grave mistake made by a large number of 
people. 

"You, who have not yet freed yourselves 
of the egocentrism of youth or of an overes-
timation of your own ego must get a clear 
understanding of 
how 
much depends on 
your own selves, to how great an extent you 
are the creators of your own freedom and of 
an interest in life. Many roads are open to 
each of you and this freedom of choice carries 
with it full responsibility for that choice. 
Gone for all time are the 
back-to-nature 
dreams of the uncultured, dreams of the free-
dom of primitive society and primitive rela-
tions. Humanity, a union of gigantic masses 
of people, was faced with the final choice— 
either submit to social discipline, lengthy 
teaching and training, or perish; there was no 
other way to live on our planet, generous as 
her nature is. The puny philosophers who 
dreamed of returning to nature did not under-
stand her or love her as she should be loved— 
if they had they would have known her mer-
ciless cruelty. 

"The man of the new society was inevi-
tably faced with the need to discipline his 
desires, will and thoughts. The struggle against 
the personal, against the 'I' that is man's 
most dangerous enemy, is essential for the 
good of society and for the maximum ex-
pansion of his own intellect. This method 
of training mind and will is today obligatory 

for every one of us as is the training of the 
body. The study of the laws of nature and 
of society with its economics has replaced 
desire by definite knowledge. When we say 
'I want to' we mean 'I know that it can be 
done'. 

"There is one other enemy amongst you, 
an enemy against whom we fight from the 
time the child makes its first steps on earth: 
that is, a crudeness of perception that some-
times 
seems to 
be primitive 
naturalness. 
Crudeness means that the key to measure and 
understanding has been lost and, consequent-
ly, the key to love, since a measure of under-
standing is a degree of love. Thousands of 
years ago the Hellenes said metron 
ariston, 
the mean is the most lofty. Today we still say 
that the basis of culture is an understanding 
of moderation in all things. 

"As the cultural level improved the striving 
for the crude pleasures of property grew 
weaker 
and there was less craving for a 
quantitative increase in the amount of proper-
ty owned, which once acquired, soon began 
to pall and leave the owner still unsatisfied. 

"We have taught you the greater pleasure 
of austerity, the pleasure of helping one 
another, the genuine joy of work that sets 
the heart on fire. We have helped you liberate 
yourselves from the power of petty strivings 
and petty things and carry your joys and dis-
appointments to a higher sphere, the sphere 
of creative activity. 

"Good physical training, the clean, regular 
lives of dozens of generations have rid you of 

the third enemy of the human psyche, indif-
ference, the empty and indolent spirit that 
arises out of a morbid insufficiency of energy 
in the body. You are going out in the world 
to work charged with the necessary energy, 
with a balanced, healthy psyche which, by 
virtue of the natural ratio of emotions, pos-
sesses more good than evil. The better you 
are, the better and more elevated society will 
be—the 
two 
conceptions are 
interrelated. 
You will create a high spiritual milieu as an 
integral part of society and society will ele-
vate you. The social milieu is the most impor-
tant factor in the training and teaching of 
the individual. Man today is training and 
learning his whole life long, so that society 
is constantly progressing." 

Evda 
Nahl stopped and smoothed her 
hair with her hand, using exactly the same 
gesture as Rhea who sat there in front, never 
once taking her eyes off her mother. 

" A t one time people called their urge to 
comprehend 
reality 
a mere dream," 
she 
continued. "You will dream in that way all 
your lives and will know joy in knowledge, 
in movement, in struggle and in labour. Nev-
er pay any attention to the falls that follow 
flights of the spirit because they are the 
regular turns of the spiral of motion that we 
find in all matter. The reality of liberty is 
stern but you have been prepared for it by 
the discipline of your schooling and upbring-
ing; you, therefore, are permitted all the 
changes of activity that constitute happiness 
because you are conscious of your responsi-

bility. The dream of tranquil inactivity has 
not been justified by history because it is 
against the nature of man the fighter. There 
always have been and still are specific diffi-
culties in every epoch, but a regular and rapid 
ascent to the heights of knowledge and emo-
tion, science and art has become the good 
fortune of all mankind!" 

Evda Nahl finished her lecture and went 
down to the front row of seats where Veda 
Kong greeted her as they had done Chara 
at the fete. All those present stood up and 
repeated the gesture, in this way expressing 
their admiration for an incomparable art. 

Chapter Ten 

T I B E T A N E X P E R I M E N T 

The Corr Yule installation on the flat top 
of a high mountain was no more than a 
thousand 
metres 
from 
the 
Astronautical 
Council's Tibetan Observatory. It stood at a 
height of nearly 4,000 metres where the only 
trees that would grow were a dark-green 
leafless variety with branches bending inwards 
towards the top, brought from Mars. Al-
though the light-yellow grass in the valleys 
waved in the wind these rigid iron-limbed 
strangers from another world stood motion-
less. The slopes were covered with streams of 
stones, the remnants of eroded rocks. The 
fields, patches and strips of snow gleamed 
with that special whiteness that belongs to 
mountain snow under a clear sky. 

A tower built of steel tubes supporting two 

latticed arches stood behind crumbling diorite 
walls belonging to a ruined monastery that 
had been built with astounding audacity at 
that great height. On the arches lay an in-
clined parabolic spiral of beryllium bronze 
dotted with the gleaming white spots of 
rhenium contacts and open to the sky. Close 
beside it lay a second spiral with the open end 
turned to the ground to form a cover over 
eight huge cones made of the greenish bora-
son amalgam. Energy was brought to the 
installation by branches of the main pipe, 
six metres in diameter. The valley was crossed 
by a line of pylons with directing rings, a 
temporary line from the observatory's main 
that was used when transmissions requiring 
the energy of all the world's stations were in 
progress. Renn Bose, scratching his tousled 
head, reviewed with a pleased air the changes 
that had been made in the former installation. 
It had all been done by volunteers in an incre-
dibly short time. The most difficult job had 
been the digging of deep, open trenches in 
the hard stone of the mountain without the 
use of big mining machines. But that was 
all over and the volunteer workers, justly 
believing themselves entitled to see the great 
experiment as a reward for their labours, 
had moved to some distance from the installa-
tion and found a place for their tents on the 
mountain slope to the north of the obser-
vatory. 

Mven Mass, who was in control of all com-
munications with the Cosmos, sat on a cold 
boulder opposite the physicist and, shivering 

slightly from the cold, told him the latest 
news from the Great Circle. Satellite 57 
had been used recently for communication 
with spaceships and planetships and had not 
been working 
for the Circle. Mven Mass 
also told him of the death of Vlihh oz Ddiz 
near star E at which the weary physicist 
showed more interest. 

"The 
high gravitational tension of star 
E will lead to its becoming overheated in its 
further evolution. 
It is becoming a violet 
super-giant 
of 
tremendous 
power that 
is 
overcoming colossal gravitation. The red end 
of the spectrum is missing altogether and, 
despite 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
gravitational 
field, the waves of light rays are shortened 
and not lengthened." 

"They become very short violet or even 
ultra-violet," agreed Mven Mass. 

"That's not all. The process goes farther. 
The quanta become bigger until at last the 
transition takes place—there is a zero field 
and antispace—the other side of the move-
ment of matter that is unknown to us on 
Earth owing to the insignificant scale of 
everything we have. We could not achieve 
anything like it even if we were to burn up 
all the hydrogen 
in all water on Earth." 

Mven Mass made a lightning mental calcu-
lation. 

"If we translate fifteen thousand trillion 
tons of water into the energy of the hydrogen 
cycle on the principle of the relativity of 
mass-energy we should get roughly a trillion 
tons of energy. The Sun gives off 240 million 

tons a minute so that it would be equal to 
no more than the Sun's radiation for ten 
years." 

Renn Bose gave a smile of satisfaction. 
"And how much does a blue super-giant 
radiate?" 

" I can't compute it at once. But you can 
judge for yourself. In the Greater Magellanic 
Cloud there is a cluster, NGK 1910, near the 
Tarantula Nebula ... excuse me, I'm accus-
tomed to using the old names and numbers 
for heavenly bodies!" 

" I t doesn't matter at all!" 
"Cluster 1910 is only 70 parsecs in dia-
meter but it contains no less than a hundred 
super-giant stars. And the Tarantula Nebula 
is so bright that if it could be moved closer 
to us like, for example, the Orion Nebula 
that everybody knows so well, it would be as 
bright as our Moon. In that area there is the 
binary blue super-giant in the Dorado, with 
clear-cut hydrogen lines in the spectrum and 
dark lines at the violet end. It is greater than 
Earth's orbit in diameter and its luminosity 
is about half a million of our suns! Is that 
the sort of star you mean? In that same clus-
ter there are stars bigger in size, with a dia-
meter equal to Jupiter's orbit, but they are 
only just beginning to warm up." 

"We'll leave the super-giants alone. For 
thousands of years people have been looking 
at the annular nebulae in Aquarius, Ursa 
Major and Lyra, not realizing that they have 
before them neutral fields of zero gravitation, 
which, according to the repagulum law, is 

the transition from gravitation to antigravi-
tation. It was there that the riddle of zero 
space was hidden." 

Renn Bose jumped up from where he had 
been sitting on the doorstep of the control 
room, a shelter built of huge blocks of cast 
stone. 

"I'm sufficiently rested. We can begin now." 
Mven Mass's heart was beating fast and 
he was almost choking from 
excitement. 
His breathing was deep and irregular. Renn 
Bose 
remained 
quite 
calm, 
the 
feverish 
gleam of his eyes alone betraying the concen-
tration of thought and will-power that the 
physicist had achieved in order to begin his 
dangerous experiment. 

Mven Mass squeezed Renn Bose's firm little 
hand in his huge palm. A nod of the head and 
Mven's tall figure was striding downhill along 
the road to the observatory. The cold wind 
howled wildly 
down 
from the ice-bound 
mountain giants that stood guard over the 
valley. Mven Mass shivered and involuntarily 
hurried 
his 
footsteps 
although, 
actually, 
there was no need for haste. The experiment 
was to begin at sunset. 

Mven Mass established radio communica-
tion with Satellite 57, using the lunar wave-
band. The reflectors and directors set up on 
the station were fixed on Epsilon Tucanae 
for the few minutes of the satellite's revolu-
tion from 33° north latitude to the South 
Pole during which the star was visible. 

Mven Mass took his place at the control 
desk in the underground room, a place very 

similar to that at the Mediterranean Obser-
vatory. 

For the thousandth time he looked through 
the sheets of data on the planet of the star 
Epsilon 
Tucanae, 
again 
systematically 
checked up the orbit of the planet and again 
got in touch with Satellite 57 and gave in-
structions that at the moment when the field 
was switched they must very slowly change 
direction along an arc four times greater than 
the parallax of the star. 

The time passed slowly. Mven Mass could 
not rid himself of thoughts of Beth Lohn, 
the criminal mathematician. Renn Bose ap-
peared on the TVP screen seated at the con-
trol desk of his installation. His stiff hair was 
sticking up more than usual. 

The dispatchers at the power-stations had 
been warned and reported their readiness. 
Mven Mass's hand moved towards the swit-
ches on his desk but a motion from Renn 
Bose in the screen stopped him. 

"We must warn the reserve Q station on 
the Antarctic. We have not got sufficient 
power." 

"I've done that, they're ready." 
The physicist pondered for a few more 
seconds. 

"On the Chukotka Peninsula and on Labra-
dor there are F-energy stations. If you were to 
talk to them and ask them to switch on at 
the moment of the field inversion... I'm afraid 
the apparatus is imperfect..." 

"I've done that." 
Renn Bose beamed and waved his hand. 

The colossal column of energy reached 
Satellite 57. The excited young faces of the 
observers 
appeared 
in 
the 
hemispherical 
screen at the observatory. 

Mven Mass greeted the courageous young 
people, checked up on the direction of the 
column to make sure that it would reach and 
follow the satellite. Then he switched all 
the energy over to Renn Bose. The physicist's 
head disappeared from the screen. 

The indicators 
of 
the energy 
collector 
turned their needles to the right showing 
a constant growth in the condensation of 
power. The signals burned brighter and with a 
whiter light. As Renn Bose switched on one 
field radiator after another the intensity in-
dicators fell in jerks towards zero. The sound 
of a muffled gong from the experimental 
station made the African start, but he knew 
what to do: with a movement of a lever he 
switched on the Q station and its power 
surged into the dying eyes of the indicators, 
bringing life to their falling needles. Scarcely 
had Renn Bose switched on the common 
inverter, however, than the needles again 
dropped to zero. Almost instinctively Mven 
Mass switched on both F stations. 

It seemed to 
him 
that 
the 
measuring 
instruments had been extinguished—a peculiar 
pale light filled the room. Sounds ceased. 
Another second and the shadow of death 
crossed the consciousness of the Director of 
the Outer Stations, dulling his senses. He 
struggled 
against 
a 
nauseating 
dizziness, 
squeezing the edges of the desk in his hands 

and sobbing from the effort and from a terri-
ble pain in his spine. The pale light began to 
grow brighter on one side of the underground 
room, 
but from 
which 
side, 
Mven Mass 
could not determine, or had forgotten. Per-
haps it came from the screen, or from the 
direction of Renn Bose's installation... 

Suddenly it seemed that a waving curtain 
had been torn asunder and Mven Mass heard 
clearly the splashing of waves. An indescri-
bable perfume, one that could not be remem-
bered, reached his widely dilated nostrils. 
The curtain moved to the left and in the cor-
ner the former grey hangings were still trembl-
ing. 
High 
copper 
mountains 
materialized 
before 
his 
eyes with 
remarkable 
reality; 
they 
were surrounded by turquoise trees 
and the violet waves of the sea splashed at 
Mven Mass's feet. The curtain moved still 
farther to the left and he saw his dream. A 
red-skinned woman sat on the upper plat-
form of the staircase leaning on the polished 
surface of a white stone table, staring at the 
ocean. Suddenly she saw something and her 
widely placed eyes were filled with astonish-
ment and admiration. The woman stood up 
with magnificent elegance and stretched out 
her open hand to the African. She was breath-
ing spasmodically and in that moment of 
delirium she reminded Mven Mass of Chara 
Nandi. 

"Offa alii cor!" 
Her gentle, melodious and 
strong voice penetrated to Mven Mass's heart. 
He opened his mouth to answer her but in 
place of his vision there was a green flame and 

a shattering whistle filled the room. As the 
African lost consciousness he felt some soft, 
invincible power folding him in three, rotating 
him like the blade of a turbine, and then 
flattening him out against something solid. 
Mven Mass's last thought was of the fate of 
Satellite 57, the station and Renn Bose... 

The observatory staff and the 
builders 
who were some distance away saw very little. 
Something 
flashed 
across 
the 
profound 
Tibetan sky that dimmed the brightness of 
the stars. Some invisible power crashed down 
on to the mountain on which the experi-
mental station was situated. Then came a 
whirlwind that swept up a mass of stones. A 
black stream, some five hundred metres in 
diameter that seemed to have been fired from 
a gigantic hydraulic gun raced towards the 
observatory building, swept upwards, turned 
back and again struck the mountain, smashing 
the entire 
installation and scattering 
the 
fragments. An instant later everything was 
quiet again. The dust-filled air was saturated 
with the odour of hot stones and burning 
mixed with a strange aroma similar to that of 
the flowering coast of a tropical sea. 

At the site of the catastrophe the people 
saw that a wide furrow with molten edges 
had been ploughed across the valley, and that 
the side of the mountain facing it had been 
torn clean away. The observatory building 
had not been touched. The furrow stretched 
as far as the south-eastern wall where it had 
destroyed 
the 
transformer chamber 
built 
against it; it ended at the dome of the under-

ground chamber cast from 
a four-metre-
thick layer of molten basalt. The basalt was 
polished as though 
it 
had been 
worked 
on a grinding machine. Part of it remained 
untouched and that had saved Mven Mass and 
the 
underground chamber 
from complete 
destruction. 

A stream of molten silver hardened in a 
hollow—the melted fuses of the power re-
ceiver! 

Emergency lighting cables were soon con-
nected and when the searchlight from the 
lighthouse on the highway threw out its beam 
an appalling sight met the eyes of the on-
lookers—the whole of the metal structure of 
the 
experimental 
installation 
was 
spread 
along the furrow in a gleaming thin coating, 
making the ground shine as though it had 
been chromium-plated. A piece of the bronze 
spiral had been pressed into the precipice 
formed where the side of the hill had been 
cut away as clean as with a knife. The rocks 
had melted into a glassy mass, like sealing 
wax under a hot stamp. The turns of the 
spiral of reddish metal with its white rhenium 
tooth-like contacts were embedded in the 
rock and gleamed in the electric light like a 
flower done in enamel. One glance at that 
piece of jewellery two hundred metres in 
diameter was sufficient to arouse fear of the 
unknown 
force that 
had operated there. 

When the fallen boulders had been cleared 
away from the entrance to the underground 
chamber rescue workers found Mven Mass 
on his knees with his head resting on the 

bottom step. 
The Director of the 
Outer 
Stations had apparently made an effort to 
escape the moment he regained consciousness. 
There were doctors amongst the volunteers 
who had been working there and his power-
ful 
organism aided by 
no 
less 
powerful 
medicines soon recovered. Mven Mass got to 
his feet, still trembling and staggering and 
had to be supported on both sides. 

"Renn Bose?" 
The faces of the people surrounding the 
scientist darkened at this question, and the 
Director of the Observatory said harshly: 

"Renn Bose has been badly disfigured. He 
is hardly expected to live." 

"Where is he?" 
"He was found at the bottom of the eastern 
slope of the mountain. He must have been 
hurled out of the installation building. There 
is nothing left on top of the mountain, even 
the ruins have been wiped off the face of the 
earth!" 

"Is Renn Bose still lying there?" 
"He must not be touched. Some bones 
have been crushed, some ribs broken and his 
stomach injured." 

"What's wrong with it?" 
"His stomach has been split open and his 
insides have fallen out." 

Mven Mass's legs gave way under him and 
he clutched spasmodically at the necks of 
those supporting him. His will and his mind, 
however, were functioning clearly. 

"Renn Bose must be saved at all costs. 
He is the greatest of all scientists..." 

"We know. There are five doctors there. 
They have erected a sterilized operation tent 
over him. Two men who have volunteered 
to give blood are lying beside him. The tirat-
ron, the artificial heart and liver are already 
working." 

"Then help me to the telephone room. 
Switch on to the world network and call the 
information centre in the northern zone. How 
are things on Satellite 57?" 

"We called the satellite but got no answer." 
"Are the telescopes in working order?" 
"Yes, they are." 
"Look for the satellite in the telescope 
and examine it through the electronic inver-
ter to get the maximum 
magnification." 

The night operator at the northern infor-
mation centre looked into his screen and saw 
a face smeared with blood, the eyes gleaming 
feverishly. He had to study the face for some 
time before he recognized Mven Mass who, as 
the Director of the Outer Stations, was a 
person well known throughout the planet. 

" I want Grom Orme, President of the Astro-
nautical Council and Evda Nahl, psychiatrist." 

The operator nodded his head and began 
to fiddle with the switches and vernier scales 
of the memory machines. The answer came 
back in a minute. 

"Grom Orme is preparing some papers and 
is spending the night at the Council. Shall I 
call the Council?" 

"Yes, call them. And Evda Nahl?" 
"She's at School No. 410 in Ireland. If 
you need her I can try to call her to..."—here 

the operator looked up at a diagram—"...to 
telephone station No. 5654SP!" 

"She's badly needed. It is a matter of life 
or death!" 

The operator looked up from his diagrams. 
"Has there been an accident?" 
"A very serious accident." 
"Then 
I'll hand everything over to my 
assistant and get busy on your call alone. Wait 
for me." 

Mven Mass dropped into an armchair that 
had been pushed towards him, in an effort 
to gather his thoughts and regain his strength. 
The Director of the Observatory came run-
ning into the room. 

"The situation of Satellite 57 has been 
ascertained. There is no satellite." 

Mven Mass jumped to his feet as though he 
had not received any injuries. 

" A piece of the bow which acts as a quay 
for the reception of ships, has survived," 
continued 
the staggering report, 
"and 
is 
still in the same orbit. There are probably 
some smaller pieces but they have not yet 
been discovered." 

"So the observers..." 
"They must have been killed!" 
Mven Mass clenched his fists and sank back 
into the chair. A few minutes of oppressive 
silence followed, then the screen lit up again. 

"Grom Orme is at the Council transmitter," 
said the operator and turned a handle. The 
screen showed a huge, dimly-lit hall and then 
the well-known head of the President of the 
Astronautical Council appeared. The narrow 

seemingly streamlined face, the big aquiline 
nose, the deep-set eyes under sceptically 
raised brows, the questioning twist of the 
tightly 
pressed lips... Under Grom Orme's 
glance Mven Mass hung his head like a naugh-
ty boy. 

"Satellite 57 has just been destroyed," 
began the African, plunging straight into his 
confession as he would into dark water. Grom 
Orme started and his face seemed even sharper. 

"How could that have happened?" 
Briefly and precisely Mven Mass told him 
everything, not hiding the illegality of the 
experiment or in any way sparing himself. 
The President's brows knitted together, deep 
lines appeared at the corners of his mouth 
but his glance remained calm. 

"Wait a moment, I'll see about aid for 
Renn Bose. Do you think that Ahf Noot..." 

"Ah, if you could get Ahf Noot!" 
The screen went dark. There was a long 
wait and Mven Mass, with the last of his 
strength, held himself back. He would be all 
right, soon ... ah, here was Grom Orme. 

"I found Ahf Noot and have given him a 
planetship. He will require an hour to prepare 
his apparatus and his assistants. In two hours 
he'll be at your observatory. Make the neces-
sary arrangements for the handling of heavy 
cargo. Now about you—did the experiment 
succeed?" 

The question took Mven Mass by surprise. 
He did not doubt that he had seen Epsilon 
Tucanae. Was this, however, real contact 
with an inaccessibly distant world? Or had it 

been a combination of the deadly effect of 
the experiment on his organism and the burn-
ing desire to see that had produced a very 
clear hallucination? Could he announce to the 
whole world that the experiment had been a 
success, that fresh efforts, new sacrifices and 
further 
expenditures 
to 
repeat it 
would 
be justified? Could he say that the method 
adopted by Renn Bose was more successful 
than that of his predecessors? For fear of 
risking anybody else's life they had foolish-
ly carried out the experiment alone, just the 
two of them. 
But what had Renn seen? 
What could he tell them?.. Would he ever be 
able to talk ... if he had seen!.. 

Mven Mass stood up still straighter. 
"I have no proof that the experiment was 
successful. I don't know what Renn Bose 
saw..." 

Undisguised 
sorrow 
was expressed 
on 
Grom Orme's face. A minute before that he 
had only been attentive, now he had become 
stern. 

"What do you propose to do?" 
"With your permission I will hand over 
the station to Junius Antus immediately. I 
am no longer worthy to direct it. Then, 
I'll remain with Renn Bose to the end..." 
he stammered and then corrected himself, 
"...until the end of the operation. Then ... 
then I'll go away to the Island of Oblivion 
to await trial. 
I have already condemned 
myself!" 

"Possibly you are right. Some of the cir-
cumstances are not yet clear to me, so I must 

reserve my 
judgement. 
Your actions will 
be examined at the next meeting of the 
Astronautical Council. Whom do you consider 
the most fitting successor to your post-
firstly for the work of rebuilding the satel-
lite?" 

" I 
don't know a better candidate than 
Darr Veter!" 

The President of the Council nodded his 
consent. For some time he continued look-
ing at the African as though he intended 
saying something but instead he just made a 
gesture of farewell. The screen was extin-
guished just in time, for at that moment 
everything went hazy in Mven Mass's head. 

"You tell Evda Nahl yourself," he whis-
pered to the Director of the Observatory who 
was standing near by; then he fell, made seve-
ral attempts to get up and lost consciousness. 

A little man with Mongoloid features, a 
merry smile and unusually impefative in his 
words and actions, became the centre of 
attention at the Tibetan Observatory. The 
assistants that had come with him obeyed 
him with that glad willingness with which 
faithful soldiers had probably followed the 
great captains of ancient days. The authority 
of their teacher, however, did not suppress 
their own ideas and enterprise. They constit-
uted 
a very 
harmonious 
little 
group 
of 
strong people worthy to give battle to man's 
most terrible and implacable enemy—death! 

When Ahf Noot learned that Renn Bose's 
heredity record had still not been received 

he gave vent to exclamations of indignation, 
but was just as quickly calmed when he was 
told that it was being prepared by Evda Nahl 
herself and that she would bring it in person. 

The Director of the Observatory asked 
quietly what the record index was needed for 
and in what way Renn's distant ancestors 
could help. Ahf Noot screwed up his eyes 
slyly as though he were about to divulge a 
great secret. 

"Accurate 
knowledge 
of 
the 
heredity 
structure of every person is needed both for 
an understanding of his psychological struc-
ture and to help make predictions in that 
field; it also provides important data on his 
neurophysiological peculiarities, the resistance 
factor of his organism, immunity, selective 
sensitivity to traumas and allergy to medi-
cines. The choice of treatment cannot be 
precise without 
an understanding of 
the 
heredity structure and the conditions under 
which his ancestors lived." 

The Director wanted to ask more questions 
but Ahf Noot stopped him. 

"I've given you a sufficient answer for 
independent thought. 
I have no time for 
more!" 

The Director muttered some apology which 
the surgeon did not wait to hear. 

A portable operating theatre was erected at 
the foot of the mountain: water, electricity 
and compressed air were laid on. A huge num-
ber of workers offered their services and the 
building was ready in three hours. Ahf Noot's 
assistants 
selected 
fifteen 
doctors 
from 

amongst the volunteer builders to service the 
surgical clinic that had been so rapidly built. 
Renn Bose was carried under a transparent 
plastic shield that had been fully sterilized 
and had had sterilized air blown through it 
by means of special filters. Ahf Noot and 
four of his assistants entered the first section 
of the operating theatre and remained there 
several hours where they were subjected to 
waves of bactericides and air saturated with 
antiseptic emanations until their very breath 
became sterilized. 
In the meantime 
Renn 
Bose's body was subjected to deep freezing. 
Then their swift and confident work began. 

The shattered bones and torn blood vessels 
were joined by the means of tantalum hooks 
and plates that did not irritate the living 
tissues. Ahf Noot sorted out the injured in-
testines and stomach: 
they were quickly 
freed of the mortified parts, stitched up and 
placed in a jar of healing solution HS 14 
that was prepared in conformity with the 
somatic properties of the human organism. 
He then started on his hardest job. From 
under the ribs he removed the blackened 
liver, pierced with fragments of the rib bones, 
and, while his assistants held it suspended in 
position, 
he confidently 
treated the fine 
hairs of the autonomous nerves of the sym-
pathetic and parasympathetic systems and 
pulled them into position behind it. The 
slightest harm done to these finer branches 
of the nerves might lead to serious, irreparable 
damage. With a lightning-like movement the 
surgeon cut through the portail vein and 

joined the tubes of artificial blood vessels to 
the two ends. Then he did the same with the 
artery and placed the removed liver in a jar of 
solution HS 14. After an operation lasting 
five hours all Renn Bose's injured organs were 
in 
separate 
jars. 
Artificial 
blood 
flowed 
through his body, pumped by the patient's 
own heart and an auxiliary double-heart, a 
tiny automatic pump. Now they had to wait 
for the healing of the removed organs. Ahf 
Noot could not simply replace the liver with 
another from the planet's surgical fund be-
cause that would require further investigation 
and the condition of the sick man would not 
permit of any delay. One of the surgeons 
stayed with the outstretched body (it looked 
just like an anatomized corpse) until the next 
shift of surgeons had undergone their steriliza-
tion. 

The doors of the protective walls built 
round the operation theatre opened noisily 
and 
Ahf 
Noot, 
squinting and 
stretching 
himself like a beast of prey awakened from 
its slumber, appeared in the company of his 
blood-smeared assistants. Evda Nahl, tired 
and pale, met him and handed him Renn 
Bose's heredity record. Ahf Noot snatched 
at it eagerly, glanced through it and heaved 
a sigh of relief. 

"I think everything will be all right. Come 
on and get some sleep." 

"But... suppose he wakes up?" 
"Come along. He can't wake up. Do you 
think we are so foolish that we did not take 
care of that?" 

"How long must we wait?" 
"Four or five days. If the biological investi-
gation is accurate and the calculations are cor-
rect we shall then be able to make another 
operation, putting all the organs back. After 
that, consciousness..." 

"How long can you stay here?" 
"About ten days. The catastrophe fortu-
nately coincided with a break in my teaching 
work. I'll take advantage of the opportunity 
to have a look at Tibet, I've never been here 
before. It is my fate to live where there are 
most people, in the inhabited zone!" 

Evda ISIahl gazed at the surgeon in admira-
tion. Ahf Noot smiled gloomily. 

"You're looking at me in the same way 
as people used to look at an image of a god. 
That does not befit the cleverest of my pupils!" 

" I really am seeing you in a different way. 
This is the first time in my life that a person 
dear to me has been in the hands of a surgeon 
and I can well understand the emotions of 
those who have come in contact with your 
art—knowledge 
combined 
with 
unexcelled 
skill!" 

"All right! Admire me, if you must. I shall 
have time to perform not only a second but 
even a third operation on your physicist." 

"What third operation?" asked Evda Nahl, 
immediately on the alert. Ahf Noot, however, 
squinted cunningly and pointed to the path-
way leading to the observatory. Mven Mass, 
his head bowed, was hobbling down. 

"Here's another unwilling admirer of my 
art. Have a talk with him, if you can't sleep, 

that is. I must 
sleep." 

The surgeon disappeared round an irregula-
rity in the hill in the direction of the tempo-
rary home of the doctors. From afar Evda 
Nahl could see how haggard the Director of 
the Outer Stations had grown and how much 
he had aged: but then, Mven Mass was no lon-
ger Director. She told him everything she had 
learned from 
Ahf 
Noot and the 
African 
heaved a sigh of relief. 

"Then I'll go away in ten days' time." 
"Are you doing the right thing, Mven? 
I'm still suffering too much from shock to be 
able to think over what has happened, but it 
doesn't seem to me that your guilt is so great 
as to require such condemnation." 

Mven Mass frowned painfully. 
"I 
was carried away 
by 
Renn 
Bose's 
brilliant theories. I had no right to apply all 
Earth's power to the first attempt." 

"Renn Bose showed you that an attempt 
would be useless with less power," she object-
ed. 

"That's true, but we should have made in-
direct experiments first. I was insanely impa-
tient and did not want to wait years. Don't 
waste words—the Council will confirm my 
decision and the Control of Honour and Jus-
tice will not annul it." 

"I'm a member of the Control of Honour 
and Justice myself!" 

"And apart from you there are ten other 
people. Since my case concerns the whole 
planet there will be a decision by the Joint 
Controls of 
North and 
South—twenty-one 

people besides you." 

Evda Nahl laid a hand on the African's 
shoulder. 

"Let's sit down, Mven, you're weak on 
your legs. Did you know that when the first 
doctors looked at Renn they decided to 
call a death concilium?" 

" I know, they were two short. All doctors 
are conservative, and according to an old 
rule that they haven't got down to changing, 
there must be twenty-two people to decide 
to give a patient an easy death." 

"Until 
recently 
the 
death 
concilium 
consisted of sixty doctors!" 

"That is a relic of the days when there was 
a fear of the right to put a patient out of his 
suffering being misused; in those days doctors 
used to condemn the sick to long and useless 
suffering and their relatives to senseless moral 
torment, even when there was not the slight-
est hope and death would have been a quick 
and easy release. But still, you see how use-
ful tradition has been in this case, they were 
two short and I was able to get Ahf Noot, 
thanks to Grom Orme." 

"That's what I wanted to remind you of. 
Your own concilium of social death so far 
consists of only one man!" 

Mven Mass took Evda's hand and raised 
it to his lips and she permitted him this ges-
ture of great and intimate friendship. She 
was, at the moment, the only friend of a 
strong man oppressed by moral responsibility. 
The only one? And if Chara had been in her 
place? No ... to receive Chara now the Afri-

can would need great spiritual uplift and he 
still had not found strength enough for that. 
Let everything go its own way until Renn 
Bose recovered and the Astronautical Coun-
cil held its meeting. 

"Do you know what the third operation 
is that Renn has to undergo?" asked Evda, 
to change the subject. Mven Mass thought 
for a moment and then recalled a conversa-
tion he had had with Ahf Noot. 

"Noot wants to take advantage of Renn's 
being opened up to cleanse his organs of 
accumulations of entropy. It is usually done 
by physiochemotherapy and takes a long 
time, but it can be done in conjunction with 
such extensive surgery much more quickly 
and thoroughly." 

Evda Nahl thought over everything she 
knew of the basis of longevity, the cleans-
ing of the organism of entropy. Man's fish, 
saurian and arboreal ancestors have left con-
tradictory vestiges of ancient physiological 
structures in his organism each of which has 
its own specific way of forming entropic 
remnants of their activity. Thousands of years 
of study of these ancient centres of entropy 
accumulation, formerly the cause of senility 
and sickness, have resulted in the elaboration of 
cleansing by chemical and ray treatment and 
in the working out of methods of stimulating 
the aging organism with wave baths. 

In nature living beings are freed of accu-
mulated entropy through being born of dif-
ferent 
individuals 
coming 
from 
different 
places and possessing different lines of heredity. 

This juggling with heredity in the struggle 
against entropy and the absorption of fresh 
strength from the surrounding world is one 
of the most difficult riddles of science that 
biologists, 
physicists, 
palaeontologists 
and 
mathematicians have been battling with for 
thousands of years. But the struggle has 
been worth it, expectation of life is now al-
most two hundred years and, more impor-
tant still, that exhausting period of decay 
in old age has been eliminated. 

Mven 
Mass 
guessed 
the 
psychiatrist's 
thoughts. 

" I have been thinking of the new and great 
contradiction of our lives," said the African. 
"I mean the power of biological medicine 
that fills the body with new strength and the 
constantly increasing creative labour of the 
brain that burns a man up so quickly. How 
complicated everything is in the laws of our 
world!" 

"That's true and explains why we are lag-
ging behind with the development of man's 
third system of signals,"26 agreed Evda Nahl. 
"Thought-reading greatly facilitates communi-
cation between individuals but requires a 
great expenditure of energy and weakens 
the inhibitory nerve centres. This latter effect 
is the most dangerous." 

"And still the majority of the people, the 
real workers, live only half the possible num-
ber of years owing to their tremendous ner-
vous tension. As far as I can understand, medi-
cine cannot combat this except by forbid-
ding people to work. But, then, who will give 

up his work for the sake of a few extra years 
of life?" 

"Nobody, naturally, because people only 
fear death and try to hang on to life when 
their lives have been passed in isolation and 
in sorrowful expectation of joys never ex-
perienced," said Evda Nahl pensively; despite 
herself she could not help remembering that 
people live longer on the Island of Oblivion 
than anywhere else. 

Mven 
Mass once again understood 
her 
unspoken thoughts and grimly suggested that 
they return to the observatory to rest. Evda 
consented. 

Two months later Evda Nahl found Chara 
Nandi in the upper hall of the Palace of 
Information, whose tall columns gave the 
appearance of a Gothic cathedral. The rays 
of the sun, slanting down from high windows, 
crossed at half the height of the hall, creating 
a warm glow above and soft twilight below. 

The girl stood leaning against a column, her 
hands folded behind and her legs crossed. 
Evda Nahl, as usual, could not help admiring 
her simple attire—a short grey dress trimmed 
with blue and with a very low-cut bodice. 

Chara glanced over her shoulder as Evda 
approached and her sorrowful eyes lit up. 

"What 
are 
you 
doing here, Chara? 
I 
thought you were practising a new dance to 
surprise us with." 

"Dances are a thing of the past," said Cha-
ra, seriously. " I ' m choosing a job in a field 
I'm acquainted with. There is a vacancy at 

a factory 
growing artificial leather some-
where in the South Seas near Celebes and 
another at the station developing perennial 
plants in the old Atakama Desert. I was happy 
working in the Atlantic Ocean, everything 
was so clear and bright and joyful there from 
the power of the sea and an unthinking con-
tact with it ... I enjoyed skilful play and 
competing against the waves, the big waves 
that are always there waiting for you and, 
as soon as you've finished work..." 

"I, too, have only to give way to melan-
choly to recall my first work in the psycho-
logical sanatorium in New Zealand where 
I was just an ordinary nurse. And Renn Bose, 
today, after his terrible accident, says that 
he was happiest when he was working on heli-
copter traffic 
control. 
But, Chara, surely 
you know that's just weakness! It's only 
fatigue from the tremendous strain that was 
necessary for you to keep at the high artis-
tic level you have achieved. It is going to be 
worse later on when your body ceases to be 
so 
splendidly 
charged with 
vital 
energy. 
But as long as it remains what it is, please 
give us the pleasure of admiring your skill 
and your beauty." 

"You don't know how it is with me, Ev-
da. Every new dance I prepare is a matter 
of joyful search. I realize that I shall once 
more be giving people something good, some-
thing that brings them joy and reaches to the 
very depths of their emotions and that is what 
I live by. The moment comes when my plan is 
put into effect and I give myself up entirely 

to one burst of passion, to furious, flaming 
voluptuousness. I suppose this is transmitted 
to the audience and accounts for the enthu-
siasm with which the dance is received. I 
give all of myself to you all!" 

"And then what next? A sudden anti-
climax?" 

"Yes! I'm just like a song that has flown 
away and vanished into thin air, I'm an exile 
from a vanished world that nobody wants 
and to whom nothing is left but the admira-
tion of naive youth. I do not create anything 
that is registered by the intellect!" 

"You do more than that, you leave some-
thing in the hearts of people!" 

"That's all very immaterial and transient—I 
was thinking of myself!" 

"You've never loved, have you, Chara?" 
The girl lowered her eyelashes and her chin 
stuck out. 

"Is that what you think when you look at 
me?" she answered with another question. 

Evda Nahl shook her head. 
"I 
mean that tremendous big emotion 
that you, but not everybody, are capable 
of." 

"I know what you mean, the poverty of 
my intellectual life leaves me a richness of 
emotion..." 

"That's the right idea in essence but I 
would 
explain 
it 
differently; you are so 
gifted emotionally that the other side does 
not necessarily have to be poor, although, 
of course, it will naturally be weaker by the 
law 
of 
contradictions. 
We're talking 
too 

much in the abstract and I have an urgent 
matter to talk to you about, something that 
directly 
concerns our conversation. 
Mven 
Mass..." 

The girl flinched and Evda Nahl felt that 
she was inwardly putting up barriers against 
her. She took Chara under the arm and led 
her to a side gallery of the hall where the 
dark wooden panelling harmonized beauti-
fully with the blue-gold of the stained glass 
in the arched windows. 

"Chara, 
my 
dear, you are an earthly, 
light-loving flower transplanted on to the 
planet of a double star. There are two suns 
in the sky, one blue and the other red, and 
the flower does not know which one to turn 
to. You are a daughter of the red sun, why 
do you turn to the blue?" 

Strongly but gently Evda drew the girl 
to her shoulder and Chara suddenly snuggled 
up to her. The famous psychiatrist stroked 
the girl's thick, somewhat harsh hair, thinking 
all the time how thousands of ye"ars of train-
ing had changed man's petty private joys 
for something greater and common to all. 
But how far they still were from victory 
over the loneliness of the soul, especially in a 
soul complicated by a gamut of feelings and 
impressions, nurtured by a body rich in life. 
Aloud she said: 

"Mven Mass—do you know what's hap-
pened to him?" 

"Of course, the whole planet is talking 
about his unsuccessful experiment!" 

"And what do you think?" 

"I think he was right!" 
"So do I. That's why we have to get him 
off the Island of Oblivion. 
A month from 
now there will be the annual meeting of the 
Astronautical Council. His misdeeds will be 
discussed and the Council's decision will be 
handed over to the Control of Honour and 
Justice that constitutes the guardian of every 
person on the planet. I have every reason 
to hope for a lenient verdict, but Mven Mass 
must be here. A man whose emotions are 
quite as strong as yours must not remain 
long on the island, especially as he is alone!" 

" A m I really so much of an ancient woman 
that I build up plans for my life to depend on 
what a man is doing, even if it is the man 
I've chosen myself?" 

"Chara, my child, don't! I've seen you to-
gether and I know what you mean to him and 
he to you. Don't blame him for not having 
seen you, for having hidden from you. Think 
what it would mean to a man, one of the 
same type as yourself, to come to you whom 
he loves—yes, it's true, Chara—badly defeat-
ed and iiable to judgement and exile. Could 
he have come to you, one of the world's 
beauties?" 

"That's not what I was thinking of, Evda. 
Does he need me now that he is weary and 
broken? 
I'm afraid he may not have the 
strength necessary for a great flight of the 
spirit, not intellectual, but emotional this 
time, for such love as I believe we are both 
capable of. 
If he doesn't possess strength 
enough he might lose faith in himself a sec-

ond time and that would be too much for 
him. That's why I thought that it would be 
better for me to be... in the Atakama Desert!" 

"You're right, Chara, but only from one 
side. You have forgotten his loneliness and 
the unnecessary self-condemnation of a great 
and passionate 
man who has nothing to 
support him once he has left our world. I 
would go there myself but I have Renn Bose 
on my hands, he's just pulling through, and, 
as he's badly wounded, he comes first. Darr 
Veter's been appointed to build the new 
satellite and that's his share in helping Mven 
Mass. I'm making no mistake when I tell 
you quite seriously to go to him, ask nothing 
of him, not even a tender glance, no plans 
for the future, no love ... only give him 
your support, dispel his doubts in his own 
right and then bring him back to our world. 
You have strength enough to do that, Chara. 
Will you go?" 

The girl was breathing fast, she raised 
her childishly 
trusting eyes to the older 
woman and there were tears in them. 

"I'll go today!" 
Evda Nahl kissed Chara heartily. 
"You're right, you must hurry. We'll go 
to Asia Minor together on the Spiral Way. 
Renn Bose is in a surgical sanatorium on 
the Island of Rhodes and I'll send you on to 
Deir-es-Sohr where there is a helicopter base 
belonging to the technical and medical first-
aid service on the Australia and New Zea-
land route. I can imagine the pleasure it will 
give the pilot to take the famous dancer 

Chara—alas, not the biologist Charal—to any 
place she wants to visit." 

The chief conductor of train 116/7s in-
vited Evda Nahl and her companion to pay 
a visit to the central control room. A corridor, 
covered with a silicolloid hood, ran along 
the roofs of the coaches for the whole length 
of the train. Mechanics walked up and down 
this corridor, from one end of the train to 
the other, watching instruments indicating 
the temperature of the axles, the strain on the 
springs and frame of each of the cars. Geiger 
counters kept a check on lubrication and 
brakes. The two women went up a spiral 
staircase and walked along the corridor until 
they came to a big cabin high up over the 
stream-lined nose of the first car. In a crystal 
ellipsoid twenty-two feet above the railway 
line sat two mechanics one on either side of 
the pyramidal hood of the electronic robot 
driver. Parabolic screens showed them every-
thing that was going on on both sides and 
behind the train. The whiskers of the antenna 
that trembled on the roof belonged to an 
apparatus that should give warning of any-
thing appearing on the line of the Spiral Way 
for the next 50 kilometres although the cir-
cumstances under which anything could ap-
pear would be very extraordinary. 

Evda and Chara sat down on a sofa against 
the back wall of the cabin placed half a me-
tre higher than the seats of the mechanics and 
allowed themselves to be hypnotized by the 
railway lines racing swiftly towards them. 

The gigantic railway crossed mountain ranges, 
was carried over the plains along huge embank-
ments and crossed narrow waters and bays 
by viaducts built deep in the water. The 
forest planted on the sides of the colossal 
cuttings and embankments formed a conti-
nuous carpet owing to the train's uniform 
speed of 200 kilometres an hour, a carpet 
that 
was 
reddish, 
light 
or 
dark 
green 
depedning on the trees of the district—pines, 
eucalypti, or olives. The calm waters of the 
Archipelago were set in motion on both sides 
of the bridge by the movement of the air as 
it was cut by the ten-metre-wide train. The 
big ripples ran out fanwise, darkening the 
transparent blue water. 

The two women sat in silence, watching 
the line and wrapped up, each in her own, 
thoughts and cares. So they sat for four 
hours on end. Another four hours were spent 
in the comfortable chairs of the saloon on 
the second storey amongst the other passen-
gers until they parted near the coast of Asia 
Minor. Evda transferred to an electrobus that 
would take her to the nearest port and Chara 
continued her way to the East Taurus station, 
the junction of the First Meridian Branch. 
Another two hours and Chara found herself 
on a hot plain, in a haze of hot dry air. Here 
on the edge of the former Syrian Desert was 
the airport Deir-es-Sohr, where spiral heli-
copters, dangerous in inhabited areas, could 
land and take off. 

Chara Nandi would never forget the weary 
hours she spent at Deir-es-Sohr waiting for 

the plane to come in. Time and again she 
thought over her words and her actions, 
trying to imagine her meeting with 
Mven 
Mass; she built up plans for the search for him 
on the Island of Oblivion, where everything was 
blurred in the procession of uneventful days. 

At last she was on her way: below spread 
the endless fields of thermo-elements in the 
Nefud and Rub-el-Hali deserts, huge stations 
for the conversion of sunshine into electric 
power. They were arranged in straight rows 
and had blinds that shielded them at night 
and from the dust; built on consolidated sand 
dunes, on plateaux cut away with a slope to 
the south and over a labyrinth of filled-in 
wadis, they stood there as a monument to 
man's terrific struggle for energy, a struggle 
that had begun when the ancient coal and 
oil resources were exhausted, after the first 
failures with atomic energy, when mankind 
came to the conclusion that the chief source 
of energy would have to be that of the 
sun in two forms—hydroelectric 
power-sta-
tions and sun stations. When new forms of 
energy, P, Q and F energy, were discovered, 
the necessity for severe economy disappeared. 
A whole forest of windmotors stood motion-
less along the southern coast of the Arabian 
Peninsula, another 
reserve power 
capacity 
for the northern living zone. In an instant the 
helicopter had crossed the barely noticeable 
line of the coast and was airborne over the 
Indian Ocean. Five thousand kilometres was an 
insignificant distance for the swift aircraft. 
Very soon Chara Nandi, followed by good 

wishes and hopes for a speedy return, left the 
helicopter, stepping wearily on her shaky legs. 

The Director of the Landing Field sent his 
daughter with a tiny flat-bottomed motor-
boat to take Chara to the Island of Oblivion. 
The two girls were frankly delighted with 
the high speed of the tiny boat as it skimmed 
the big waves of the open sea. They went 
straight to a big bay on the east coast of the 
island where there was a medical station 
belonging to the Great World. 

Coconut 
palms, 
their 
feathered 
leaves 
bowed 
over 
the 
wavelets 
lapping 
gently 
against the shore, welcomed Chara to the 
island. The medical station was deserted, all 
its workers having gone inland to destroy ticks 
discovered on certain rodents in the forest 

There was a stable at the station. Horses 
were still bred for work in places like the 
Island of Oblivion or at sanatoria where heli-
copters could not be used on account of the 
noise or electric cars on account of the ab-
sence of roads. Chara slept for a while, 
changed her clothes and then went to look at 
the rare and beautiful animals. Thereshemeta 
woman 
who was skilfully 
operating 
two 
machines—a feed distributor and a stable-
cleaning 
machine. Chara helped her with 
her work and the woman answered her ques-
tions. Chara asked her the best way to look 
for somebody on the island. The woman ad-
vised her to join one of the destroyer caravans 
that travelled all over the island and knew 
the place much better than the local inhabi-
tants. Chara approved of this idea. 

Chapter Eleven 

THE I S L A N D O F O B L I V I O N 

The hydroplane was crossing Palk Strait 
against a strong head wind, leaping over the 
flat-topped 
rollers. 
Two 
thousand 
years 
before there had been a ridge of coral reefs 
and shallows there known as Adam's Bridge. 
Recent geological processes had created a 
deep gulf in place of the ridge and deep wa-
ters now divided the lovers of repose from a 
mankind 
that 
was surging ever 
forward. 

Mven Mass stood against the rail, his feet 
placed wide apart, peering at the Island of 
Oblivion as it gradually grew in size on the 
horizon. This huge island, washed by warm 
currents, was a natural paradise. In man's 
Drimitive religious conceptions paradise had 
been a happy refuge after death where there 
were no cares or labour. The Island of Obli-

vion was also a happy asylum for those who 
were not attracted by the feverish activity 
of the Great World and who did not want to 
work on the same level as other people. 

Here in the lap of mother nature, they 
lived out their years in the peace and calm 
known to the ancient cultivator of the soil, 
fisherman or herdsman. 

Although mankind had given their weaker 
brothers a large area of wonderfully fruitful 
land, the primitive economy of the island 
could 
not fully guarantee the population 
against 
famine 
especially 
in 
periods 
of 
drought or other calamities that were so 
common where the productive forces were 
poorly developed. The Great World, there-
fore, was constantly allotting part of 
its 
reserve supplies to the Island of Oblivion. 

Food-stuffs, preserved to last for many 
years, medicines, means of biological protec-
tion and other necessities were shipped to 
the island through three ports on the north-
western, southern and eastern coasts. The 
three chief local governors also lived in the 
north, east and south and were known as the 
Directors of Animal Husbandry, Agriculture 
and 
Fisheries 
respectively. 
These 
people, 
elected by the islanders themselves, were 
always noted for their strong character. Some 
of them might have become pitiless tyrants 
if it had not been for the constant watch kept 
by the Economic and Health Councils and by 
the Control of Honour and Justice. 

Not only on the island, but also in the 
Great World it occasionally happened that 

men of the hated category of "bulls" tried to 
enter into conspiracies and organize rebellions 
but the detachments of the Destroyer Batta-
lions were as ruthless in dealing with wilful 
murderers as they were with sharks, bacteria 
and poisonous reptiles. 

As he gazed at his future asylum Mven 
Mass began to wonder whether he, too, was a 
"bull", but he put the thought aside in dis-
gust. A "bull" was a strong and energetic man 
but one completely unaffected by the suffer-
ings of others, a man who thought only of 
his own, usually unworthy, pleasures. People 
who, in the past, obtained such characters 
from an unfortunate combination of inherited 
qualities had to keep themselves in hand and 
in training throughout their lives in order to 
be worthy members of the new society. The 
sufferings, quarrels and misfortunes of man-
kind in the distant past had always been ag-
gravated by such people in various guises 
who proclaimed themselves the sole holders 
of the truth, the rulers who claimed the right 
to suppress all those whose opinions did not 
agree with theirs, the right to eradicate all 
other ways of thought or of life. Since then 
mankind has avoided the slightest sign of the 
absolute in opinions, desires and tastes and 
has become more wary of the "bulls" than of 
anything else. They, the "bulls", ignoring the 
inviolable laws of economics, with no thought 
for the future, lived only for the present. The 
wars and disorganized economy of the Era of 
Disunity had led to the plundering of the 
Planet. In those days forests were felled, sup-

plies of coal and oil that had accumulated in 
the course of millions of years were burned 
up, the atmosphere was polluted by carbon 
monoxide and other filth that belched out 
of improperly constructed factories, beautiful 
and harmless animals were annihilated. Great 
difficulties were left for the descendants. In 
the 
Era of 
Unity 
the 
most complicated 
reorganization of the world had to be under-
taken in countries whose trees had degenerat-
ed into bushes and their cattle into dwarfs. 
The earth had been littered with rubbish of all 
sorts—broken glass, paper, rusty iron—and the 
rivers and sea-coasts had been polluted by 
waste oil and chemicals. Only when the water, 
air and earth had been properly cleansed did 
man see his planet in its present form where 
he could go anywhere barefoot without fear 
of hurting his feet. 

But had not he, Mven Mass, who had been 
less than two years in an important post, 
destroyed 
an 
artificial 
satellite 
built 
by 
thousands of people employing miracles of 
the engineer's art? Four competent scientists, 
any of whom might have become a Renn Bose, 
had been killed and Renn Bose himself had 
been saved with the greatest difficulty. Again 
the figure of Beth Lohn, hiding somewhere 
in the mountains and valleys of the Island of 
Oblivion, arose before his eyes, this time 
arousing great sympathy in him. Before he 
had left, Mven Mass had seen photographs 
of the mathematician, and had remembered 
his energetic face with its massive jaw and 
sharp eyes, deep-sunk and close to each 

other—he 
remembered 
his whole 
athletic 
frame... 

The hydroplane engineer came over to 
Mven Mass. 

"There's heavy surf. We shan't be able to 
put in to the coast, the waves are beating 
over the mole. We'll have to make for the 
southern port." 

"There's no need to. You have life rafts. 
I can put my clothes on one and swim ashore." 

The engineer and helmsman looked at 
Mven Mass with respect. Surf-capped white 
waves piled up on the shallows and poured 
down in heavy, thundering cascades. Closer 
to the shore a disorderly swirl of waves 
whipped the sand and foam together and 
raced far up the low beach. The warm, fine 
rain that fell from the low-hanging clouds 
was swept at a slant by the wind and mixed 
with the wisps of foam. 

Some grey figures were dimly visible on 
the beach through the veil of haze. 

The engineer and the helmsman exchanged 
glances as Mven Mass stripped and packed up 
his clothes. Those who went to the Island of 
Oblivion were no longer under the guardian-
ship of society where everybody protected 
everybody else and helped him. Mven Mass's 
personality aroused the involuntary respect 
of the helmsman and he decided to warn 
him of the great danger he was running. 
The African waved his hand carelessly. The 
engineer brought him a small hermetically 
sealed case. 

"Here is a month's supply of concentrated 
foods, take it with you." 

Mven Mass thought for a second, then put 
the case and his clothes in the waterproof 
chamber, buckled the flap tightly and with 
the little raft under his arm put his leg over 
the rail. 

"Swing her round!" he commanded. The 
hydroplane 
leaned over in a sharp turn. 
Mven Mass, thrown far away from the tiny 
vessel, began his furious fight with the waves. 
Those on the boat saw him rise on the crest of 
a wave, disappear into a trough and reappear 
on another crest. 

"With his strength he'll manage it all right," 
said the engineer, with a sigh of relief. "We're 
drifting, we 
must get away from 
here." 

The 
screw 
raced and the 
little vessel 
jumped forward and lifted up on a wave 
that ran counter to it. Mven Mass's dark figure 
appeared at full height on the beach and 
merged with the haze of rain. 

Across the sandy beach, beaten hard by 
the waves, a group of people wearing nothing 
but loin-cloths came to meet him. They were 
dragging a huge, madly 
writhing fish 
in 
triumph. When they noticed Mven Mass they 
stopped and greeted him warmly. 

" A new one from that world," said one of 
the fishermen with a smile. "He swims well. 
Come and live with us!" 

Mven Mass gave the fishermen a frank, 
friendly look and shook his head. 

"It would be hard for me to live here on 
the sea-coast and always be looking at the 

expanse of water and thinking of my beauti-
ful lost world. I'm going into the interior, 
on to the plateau where the herdsmen live." 

One of the fishermen with a lot of grey 
in his thick beard that apparently was consid-
ered here an adornment to a man, laid his 
hand 
on 
the 
newcomer's 
wet 
shoulder. 

"Could you have been compelled to come 
here?" 

Mven Mass gave a bitter smile and tried 
to 
explain 
what had brought him there. 

The fisherman looked at the newcomer 
sadly and with sympathy. 

"We do not understand each other. Go 
your way," he said, pointing to the south-
east, where the 
blue terraces of 
distant 
mountains could be seen through a break in 
the clouds. " I t is a long way and there is no 
other means of transport here than..." and the 
islander slapped the powerful muscles of his 
legs. 

Mven Mass was glad to get away as quickly 
as possible and with long, swinging steps 
went up the winding path that led to some 
low hills. 

The way to the centre of the island was a 
little more than two hundred kilometres and 
Mven Mass was in no hurry. Why should he 
be? Wearisome days, not filled by any sort 
of useful labour, dragged on slowly. At first, 
when he had not fully recovered from the 
catastrophe, his tired body demanded repose, 
the tranquillity of nature. If he had not been 
conscious of the tremendous loss he had 
suffered he would have enjoyed the silence 

of the deserted, wind-swept plateux and the 
blackness 
and primordial 
silence of 
hot, 
tropical nights. 

But as day followed day, the African, 
wandering about the island in search of some 
work to interest him, began to yearn for the 
Great World. The peaceful valleys with their 
groves of hand-cultivated fruit-trees no longer 
gave him pleasure nor was he lulled by the 
almost hypnotic gurgle of the pure mountain 
streams on whose banks he could now sit 
for countless hours in the heat of the after-
noon or on a moonlit night. 

Countless hours... Why should he count 
that which was of no use to him there, time? 
He had as much as he wanted, an ocean of 
time but he felt that his own, individual time 
was so insignificant. One brief and soon-for-
gotten moment! That was what happened 
to the lives of our stone age ancestors, lives 
full of courage and real heroism! 

Only then did Mven Mass feel how well 
the island had been named—the Island of 
Oblivion! The stupid namelessness of 
the 
ancient ways of life, the doings and feelings 
of man! Deeds were forgotten by descendants 
because they were performed for the satis-
faction of individual needs and did not make 
the life of the community easier and better, 
did not brighten life with creative art. 

Mven was accepted into a company of 
herdsmen in the centre of the island and for 
two months pastured herds of buffaloes at 
the foot of a huge mountain bearing the 
clumsily long name it had been given by the 

people who inhabited the island in ancient 
days. 

For a long time he boiled his black porridge 
in a sooty pot and a month before he had had 
to seek fruits and nuts in the forest in compe-
tition with the greedy monkeys who threw 
their shells and peelings at him. That had hap-
pened when he had given the food he brought 
from the hydroplane to an old couple in a 
distant valley in accordance with the rule of 
the Great Circle World and its greatest joy: 
first give pleasure to others. Then he had 
discovered what it meant to have to seek food 
in unpopulated desert places. What a sense-
less waste of time! 

Mven Mass got up from the stone on which 
he had been sitting and glanced round. The 
sun was setting behind the edge of the plateau 
and the wooded, rounded top of a hill rose 
up before him. 

Below in the twilight murmured a swift 
rivulet 
flowing 
between growths of 
tall, 
feathered 
bamboos. 
Half a day's journey 
on foot or on the back of a buffalo at an even 
slower pace, stood the almost six-thousand-
year-old ruins of the ancient capital of the 
island. Other 
bigger and better 
preserved 
cities had also been abandoned. Mven Mass 
took no interest in them so far. 

The herd lay like black boulders in the 
dark grass. Night fell quickly. The stars came 
out in their thousands to twinkle in the black 
sky. This was the darkness to which the astro-
nomer was accustomed... the well-known out-
lines of the constellations... the bright lights 

of the bigger stars. From there he could see 
the 
fatal Tucanae—but how weak human 
eyes are! Never again would he see the magni-
ficent spectacle of the Cosmos, the spirals of 
the gigantic galaxies, the mysterious planets 
and blue suns. All these were now only points 
of light immeasurably distant. Did it matter 
any more whether they were stars or lanterns 
hanging on a crystal sphere, as the ancients 
used to think? To the unaided eye it was all 
the same! 

The African scraped together the brush-
wood he had made ready. There was another 
article that had become necessary, a small 
lighter. Perhaps soon he would follow the 
example of some of the local inhabitants 
and inhale narcotic smoke to make the end-
lessly lengthy days seem shorter. 

Tongues of 
flame 
played amongst the 
sticks, driving away the darkness and extin-
guishing the stars. The big animals were snuf-
fling peacefully near by. Mven Mass stared 
pensively into the fire. 

Had this bright planet of ours become a 
gloomy home for him? 

No, his proud renunciation was nothing 
more than the self-confidence of ignorance. 
Ignorance of his own self, an underestimation 
of the loftiness of the full creative life he had 
lived, a misunderstanding of his love for 
Chara. It would be better to sacrifice his 
life for one hour of some worthwhile deed 
for the Great World than to live here a whole 
century. 

On the Island of Oblivion there were about 

two hundred medical centres where doctor 
volunteers from the Great World provided the 
local 
inhabitants with 
everything 
modern 
medicine could offer. The youth of the Great 
World also served in the Destroyer Battalions 
that prevented the island from becoming a 
breeding ground for 
the 
ancient diseases 
and for harmful animal life. Mven Mass deli-
berately avoided meeting these people so that 
he should not feel himself an outcast from 
the world of beauty and knowledge. 

At 
dawn 
Mven 
Mass was relieved 
by 
another 
herdsman. 
He was free for 
two 
days and decided to go to a small town to 
get a cloak as the nights in the mountains 
were chilly. 

It was a calm, hot day when Mven Mass 
left the plateau and descended to the wide 
plain, a veritable sea of pale lilac and golden-
yellow flowers over which countless brightly-
coloured insects were hovering. Puffs of a 
light breeze made the tops of the plants wave 
and the flowers gently brushed their heads 
against Mven Mass's bare knees as he walked 
through them. When he reached the middle 
of the huge field he stood still for a moment 
to enjoy the simple and joyful beauty of that 
aroma-filled natural garden. Bending down, 
the African passed the palms of his hands 
pensively over the wind-rocked flowers, and 
felt 
he was reliving a childhood 
dream. 

A 
faint, 
rhythmical 
tinkle 
reached his 
ears. Mven Mass raised his head and saw a 
girl walking along swiftly, up to her waist 
in flowers. She turned to one side and Mven 

Mass looked admiringly at her graceful figure 
in the midst of that sea of flowers. A feeling 
of deep regret seized him: that could have 
been Chara if ... if things had turned out 
differently. 

His scientist's sharp powers of observation 
told him at once that the girl was worried. 
She kept looking back and increased her pace 
without reason as though she were afraid she 
were being followed. Mven Mass changed 
his direction and quickly caught up with the 
girl. 

The 
girl 
stopped. 
A 
brightly-coloured 
shawl was wrapped tightly round her body 
with the ends crossed and the hem of her red 
skirt was wet with dew. The thin bracelets 
on her bare arms tinkled more loudly as she 
threw back from her face a lock of dark 
hair that the wind had tousled. Her sorrow-
ful eyes were looking out in concentration 
from under short curls that fell carelessly 
on her cheeks and forehead. The girl was 
breathing heavily, apparently from her long 
walk. A few beads of perspiration showed on 
her pretty tanned face. She made a few un-
certain steps towards Mven Mass. 

"Who are you and where are you hurrying 
to?" he asked. "Perhaps you are in need of 
help?" 

The girl stared intently at him and then 
answered, hurriedly and jerkily: 

"I'm Onar from the 5th Settlement. But 
I don't need help." 

"I think you do! You're tired and some-
thing is bothering you. What can be threaten-

ing you? Why do you refuse my help?" 

The girl looked at him and her eyes beamed, 
pure and profound, like those of a woman of 
the Great World. 

" I know who you are! You are the big man 
from there," and she waved her hand in the 
direction of Africa and the sea. "You are 
kind and trustful." 

"You 
be the same! 
Is somebody after 
you?" 

"Yes!" gasped the girl in despair. "He's 
chasing after me!" 

"Who is he that dares to make you fear 
him and to chase after you?" 

The girl blushed and hesitated. 
"There's one man who wants me to be 
his..." 

"But surely you can choose for yourself 
whether to respond or not, can't you? How 
can he compel you to love him? Let him 
come here and I'll tell him..." 

"Oh, no! He also came from the Great 
World, but a long time ago, and he's strong, 
only he's not like you, he's terrible!" 

Mven 
Mass 
laughed 
a 
carefree 
laugh. 

"Where are you going?" 
"To the 5th Settlement. I've been to the 
town and I met..." 

Mven Mass nodded his head and took 
the girl by the hand. She allowed her fingers 
to remain in his big hand and together they 
went along a side path leading to the settle-
ment. 

On the way the girl, from time to time 
looking back apprehensively, told him that 

the man who was persecuting her was always 
accompanied by two other strong and evil 
men who were in every way obedient to him. 

Her fear to speak frankly made Mven Mass 
indignant. He had been trained from child-
hood 
by 
history 
lessons, through 
books, 
films and music to hate all those who op-
pressed people, all the secret organizations 
that had existed in the past, everything that 
was hidden from the conscience and judge-
ment of the people, everything that meant 
bloodshed and unhappiness. He could not to-
lerate the existence of oppression, even if it were 
only occasional, on their well-ordered earth! 

"Why don't your people do something?" 
exclaimed Mven Mass. "And why doesn't 
the Control of Honour and Justice know 
about it? Don't your schools teach you his-
tory and don't you know what even tiny cent-
res of brute force may lead to?" 

"We're taught ... we know..." answered 
Onar, mechanically, looking straight in front 
of her. The flowery plain had come to an end 
and the path disappeared among the bushes in 
a sharp bend. Two men jumped out at the 
bend, barring the road to them. The girl 
snatched her hand away frantically, whisper-
ing, "I'm afraid for you, go away, man from 
the Great World!" 

"Seize 
her!" came an imperative voice 
from behind the bushes. In the Great Circle 
Era nobody spoke so roughly. Mven Mass 
instinctively thrust the girl behind him and 
began to try his persuasion on these incom-
prehensibly wild people, but he stopped talk-

ing when he realized that his words did not 
reach them. 

The broad-shouldered young men ran up to 
him and tried to push him away from the 
girl but Mven Mass stood as firm as a rock. 

Then one of them gave him a lightning-like 
blow in the face with his fist. Mven Mass 
staggered. Never in his life had he seen delibe-
rate, spiteful blows struck for the purpose of 
causing hurt, to stun and insult a man. 

The other man punched him in the kidneys 
and through the ringing in his ears Mven 
Mass heard Onar's pitiful cry. Fury overcame 
him and he threw himself on his enemies, 
trying to crush them. Two deadly blows in 
the stomach and the jaw brought the African 
to the ground. Onar dropped to her knees, 
covering him with her body but her enemies 
seized her with a howl of triumph. They 
pulled her elbows back behind her and she 
straightened up in pain, her head thrown back. 
Hands filthy from earth and Mven Mass's 
blood squeezed her helplessly writhing body 
and the girl sobbed, her face purple with 
anger. 

"Bring her here!" came the loud voice 
again. The man who shouted was naked to 
the waist and athletic muscles rippled under 
the grey hair that covered his torso. 

Mven Mass, however, had already recovered. 
He had had more serious tussles during 
his 
youth 
when 
he was performing 
his 
Labours of Hercules and had fought against 
sharks and octopuses, beings not bound by 
human laws. He tried to remember all he had 

been taught about hand-to-hand fighting with 
the monsters. 

Mven Mass remained on the ground for a 
few seconds to get his breath and then with 
one powerful leap reached the men who 
were dragging Onar away. One of them turned 
to meet the attack and Mven punched him 
exactly on a nerve centre. He fell to the 
ground with a bestial howl and a moment 
later was followed by his companion, brought 
down by a well-placed kick. The girl was 
free. Mven stood face to face with the third 
man, the leader of the gang, who was lifting 
his hand to strike. He cast one glance at his 
fury-distorted face to note the spot where he 
would deliver him one crushing blow—and 
staggered back. He recognized that powerful 
face that had so long tormented him in his 
dreams when he was wondering about his 
right to carry out the Tibetan experiment. 

"Beth Lohn!" 
Lohn stood still, staring at the unknown 
dark-skinned man who had now lost all his 
customary good nature. 

The two 
confederates jumped up, still 
writhing with pain and wanted to attack 
again but the mathematician waved them 
back imperiously. 

"Beth Lohn, I have thought a lot about the 
possibility of meeting you, believing you to 
be my companion in misfortune," exclaimed 
Mven Mass, "but I never expected the meeting 
would be like this!" 

"Like what?" asked Beth Lohn insolently, 
hiding the wrath that burned in his eyes. 

Mven 
Mass waved the 
question 
aside. 

"What is the use of empty words? In that 
world you did not use them and acted, even 
if criminally, for the sake of a great idea. 
For the sake of what are you acting here?" 

"For my own sake, for myself alone!" said 
Beth 
Lohn 
contemptuously, 
spitting 
the 
words through his teeth. " I have considered 
others and the common good long enough. 
Now I realize that it is all of no use to a man. 
Some of the wise men in ancient times knew 
it, too." 

"You never did think of others, Beth Lohn," 
Mven Mass said interrupting him. "Giving way 
to your own desires in everything you have 
become what you are now—rapist, deceiver, 
an animal almost!" 

The mathematician made as if to attack 
Mven Mass but restrained himself. 

"Is it proper for a man of the Great World 
to lie? I have never been a deceiver." 

"What about them?" Mven Mass pointed to 
the two young men who were listening to the 
conversation in bewilderment. 
"Where are 
you taking them? What are you leading them 
to—the 
narcotic 
bullets of the 
Destroyer 
Battalion? You know very well that brute 
force, apparent power over other 
people, 
is the way to repudiation and death." 

"I did not deceive them in any way. They 
came of their own free will..." 

"You, with your powerful intellect and 
will-power made use of the weakness of the 
human spirit, of their willingness to submit, a 
factor that was responsible for many of the 

calamities of the ancient world. In the old 
days men could avoid responsibility by laying 
the blame on the stronger, by submitting 
blindly and obediently and then laying the 
blame for their own ignorance, laziness and 
weak will on to God, an idea, a military or 
political leader. Was that the same thing as 
reasonable obedience to a teacher of our 
world? What you want is to train people who 
are loyal to you in the same way as oppres-
sors of the past did, you want human robots." 

"Enough, you talk too much." 
"I see that you've lost too much and I 
want..." 

"And I don't want! Get out of my way!" 
Mven Mass did not budge. With his head 
bent, he stood confidently and threateningly 
in front of Beth Lohn and could feel the girl's 
trembling shoulder against his back. That 
shiver enraged him far more than the blows 
he had received. 

The mathematician stood stock still, star-
ing straight at the African, straight into his 
black eyes that 
were burning with rage. 

"Go!" he said with a loud gasp, stepping 
back from the path and ordering his compa-
nions to do the same. Mven Mass again took 
Onar by the hand and led her through the 
bushes; he could feel Beth Lohn's stare of 
hatred following him. 

At a bent in the path Mven Mass stopped 
so suddenly that Onar bumped into him. 

"Beth Lohn, let's go back to the Great 
World together!" 

The mathematician burst out laughing with 

his former abandon but Mven's sharp ear 
caught 
a 
note 
of 
bitterness 
behind 
his 
bravado. 

"Who are you to suggest such a thing? 
Do you know?.." 

"Yes, I know. I have also carried out a 
forbidden experiment and killed people I 
should have protected... My path in science 
was close to yours and we, you and I and 
others, are already on the eve of victory! 
People need you, but not such as you are to-
day." 

The mathematician stepped up to Mven 
Mass and lowered his eyes, then suddenly 
turned away and contemptuously spat out 
coarse words of refusal over his shoulder. 
Mven Mass continued his way along the path 
without a word. 

The 5th Settlement was about six miles 
away. 

The African learned that the girl lived 
quite alone and advised her to go to the east 
coast, to a seaside village where she would 
not meet the brutal Beth Lohn again. 

Formerly 
a 
famous 
scientist, 
he 
had 
become a tyrant to the quiet little settlements 
of the mountain district that lived such a 
secluded life. In order to avoid any evil con-
sequences Mven Mass decided to go into the 
settlement at once and ask for the three men 
to be kept under observation. 

Mven Mass said good-bye to Onar on the 
outskirts of the settlement. The girl told him 
that there were rumours that tigers had ap-
peared in the forests that covered the round-

topped mountain; they had either escaped 
from the reservation or were still living in the 
dense jungles that surrounded the island's 
highest mountain. She grasped his hand and 
implored him to take care of himself and not 
go through the mountains at night. Mven 
Mass made his way back quickly and as he 
thought over everything that had happened 
he could see the girl's last look, a look that 
was filled at once with both anxiety and 
loyalty such as were rarely met with in the 
Great World. For the first time in his life 
Mven Mass thought of the true heroes of the 
distant past, people who had remained good 
in face of humiliation, wrath and physical 
suffering, something that required indomit-
able courage and fortitude. For the first time 
in his life he realized that the people of an-
cient times whose life seemed so hard to his 
contemporaries had also known the meaning 
of happiness, hope and creative activity, at 
times, perhaps, even to a greater extent than 
was the case in the Great Circle Era. 

It was almost with anger that Mven Mass 
recalled the theoreticians of those days who 
based their prophecy that mankind would 
not improve in a million years on a false un-
derstanding of the slowness of the mutation 
of species in nature. 

If they had 
loved people more and had 
understood 
the dialectics of 
development 
such ridiculous ideas would never have en-
tered their heads. 

The sunset turned red the clouds that lay 
on the rounded spur of a gigantic mountain. 

Mven Mass jumped into a stream to wash 
off the dirt and blood of battle. 

Refreshed and calm at last he sat down on 
a flat stone to dry himself and rest. He would 
not be able to get to the town before night-
fall but he expected to be able to cross the 
mountain when the moon came up. As he 
sat contemplating the water gurgling over the 
stones he suddenly 
felt 
that 
somebody's 
eyes were fixed on him but could not see 
anybody. The same feeling that unseen eyes 
were watching him was still with him when 
he crossed the stream and began to climb the 
slope. 

Mven Mass walked quickly along the cart 
road leading to a plateau about 1,800 metres 
high, passing from terrace to terrace in order 
to cross a wooded spur which was the short-
est way to the town. The thin crescent of 
the new moon would light the way for no 
more than an hour and a half and it would 
be very difficult to ascend a steep mountain 
path in the dark. 

Mven Mass, therefore, had to hurry. Occa-
sional 
low trees cast shadows that made 
black lines on the dry moonlit earth. Mven 
Mass kept a sharp look-out in order not to 
stumble over the countless roots that lay in 
his way but all the time he was thinking 
deeply. 

From somewhere far away to the right, 
where the slope was gentler and lay in deep 
shadow, came a menacing growl that made 
the earth tremble as it carried over the ground. 
It was answered by a low roar from amongst 

the patches and strips of moonlight in the 
forest. These sounds had a strength in them 
that penetrated deep into a man's soul, arous-
ing a long-forgoten feeling of fear and doom 
in the victim selected by an invincible beast 
of prey. To counteract the ancient fear, in 
the African's heart there burned the no less 
ancient fury of battle, inherited from count-
less generations of nameless heroes that had 
defended the right of the human race to live 
amongst mammoths, lions, giant bears, savage 
bulls and ruthless wolf-packs in exhausting 
days spent in hunting and nights spent in 
fear-filled defence. 

Mven Mass stood still, looking round and 
holding his breath. Nothing moved in the 
silence of the night but when he walked on 
a few steps along the path, he was certain 
that he was being followed. Tigers! Was it 
possible that Onar's information was really 
correct? 

He began to run, trying to decide what to 
do when the animals, there were clearly two 
of them, attacked him. 

It was senseless to try to escape up a tall 
tree that a tiger could climb better than a 
man. What was there to fight with? There was 
nothing at hand but stones, he could not 
even break a decent club off the branches of 
trees as hard as iron. When the growls came 
from behind him and close at hand he real-
ized that he was lost. The branches of the 
trees that now overshadowed the dusty path 
stifled him, he wanted to gain courage for 
the last few moments from the eternal depths 

of the starry sky, to the study of which all 
his past life had been devoted. Mven Mass 
ran on with long strides. Fate favoured him 
for he came to a place in the forest where was 
a big, open glade. In the centre of the glade 
he noticed a heap of big boulders, ran to it, 
seized a thirty-kilogram sharp-cornered block 
of stone and turned towards the forest. He 
could now see vaguely moving, phantom-
like figures. They were striped and were easi-
ly lost amongst the shadows of the scanty 
trees. The moon was already so low that its 
edge touched the tree-tops. The lengthened 
shadows 
lay across the 
glade 
like 
paths 
and the huge cats were crawling along them 
towards 
Mven 
Mass. 
He felt 
approaching 
death in the same way as he had done in the 
underground chamber at the Tibetan Obser-
vatory. This time it was not coming from 
inside him but from outside, it gleamed in 
the green flame of the animals' phosphores-
cent eyes. Mven Mass breathed in a puff of 
wind that came through 
the heated air, 
glanced up at the shining glory of the Cosmos, 
straightened his back and raised the big stone 
above his head. 

"I'm with you!" 
A tall shadow spread 
across the glade from the darkness of the 
slope threateningly 
brandishing a knotted 
branch. For a moment the astounded Mven 
Mass forgot all about the tigers—he recognized 
the mathematician. Beth Lohn, out of breath 
from his headlong race, stood beside Mven 
Mass, gasping spasmodically. The giant cats 
had at first drawn back but now they began 

steadily approaching the men. The tiger on his 
left was no more than thirty paces away and 
had drawn up its hind legs to spring. 

"Quicker!" a loud shout resounded across 
the glade. As the pale flashes of grenade-
throwers came from three points 
behind 
Mven's back he dropped his stone in his 
surprise at the suddenness of it. The nearer 
tiger reared up on its hind legs to full height, 
the paralyzing grenades burst like the beating 
of drums and the animal lay stretched out on 
its back. The other leaped towards the forest 
but from there three figures on horseback 
appeared. A glass bomb with a powerful elect-
ric charge struck the tiger on the forehead 
and he stretched out with his heavy head in 
the dry grass. 

One of the horsemen rode forward. Never 
before had the working dress worn by people 
of the Great World seemed so elegant to Mven 
Mass—wide shorts and shirt of strong, artifi-
cial blue linen open at the neck and with 
breast pockets. 

"Mven Mass, I felt that you were in danger!" 
Could he fail to recognize that high-pitched 
voice that was still full of alarm! Chara Nan-
di! 
The 
African 
forgot 
to 
answer her and 
stood rooted to the spot until the girl sprang 
from her horse and ran to him. She was 
followed by her five companions whom Mven 
Mass could not get a glimpse of because the 
moon had hidden behind the trees; the wind 
died down and stifling darkness enveloped 
the glade and the forest. Chara's hand found 
Mven's elbow. He took her thin wrist and 

laid her hand on his chest where his heart 
was beating wildly. Chara's fingertips stroked 
a bulging muscle and that 
gentle caress 
gave Mven Mass a sense of tranquillity such as 
he had never known before. 

"Chara, this is Beth Lohn, my new friend." 
He turned round and found that the mathe-
matician had disappeared. 

"Beth Lohn, don't go away!" he shouted 
with all his might into the darkness. 

"I'll come back!" a powerful voice answered 
from a distance and this time there was no 
bitter insolence in it. 

One of Chara's companions, a youth of 
medium height, apparently the leader of the 
group, took a lantern that was hanging behind 
his saddle. A faint light together with an un-
seen radio ray rose into the air and Mven Mass 
guessed that they were expecting an aircraft 
of some sort. All five were little more than 
boys, members of a Destroyer Battalion who 
had chosen, as one of their Labours of Hercu-
les, the security service that fought against 
dangerous animals on the Island of Oblivion. 
Chara Nandi had joined them in her search for 
Mven Mass. 

"You're mistaken if you think we're so as-
tute," said the leader when they were sitting 
in a circle round the lantern and Mven Mass 
began asking the inevitable questions. 
" A 
girl with an ancient Greek name helped us." 

"Onar!" exclaimed Mven Mass. 
"Yes, Onar. Our detachment was approach-
ing the 5th Settlement from the south when 
the girl came running up to us on the verge of 

collapse. She confirmed the rumour about 
the tigers that had brought us here and per-
suaded us to ride after you immediately as 
there was a danger that they might attack you 
when you were crossing the mountain. As 
you see we were only just in time. A cargo 
helicopter will come soon and we'll send your 
temporarily paralyzed enemies to a reserva-
tion. If they really turn out to be man-eaters 
they'll be killed. But such a rare animal must 
not be destroyed until it has been tested." 

"What sort of test?" 
The boy raised his brows. 
"That's outside our competency. To begin 
with, they'll probably be given a tranquilli-
zer... Now and again people who have too 
much misapplied energy and strength have to 
be dealt with in that way, too." 

"How 
is it 
done?" 
asked Mven Mass. 

" I 
know of a case of an unbelievably 
brutal athlete here who forgot his social du-
ties and obligations. He was given an injection 
to lower vital activity and bring his physical 
strength down to the level of his weak will 
and intellect thus balancing the two sides of 
his being. In the last three years he has learnt 
a lot—your enemies will be taught in the 
same way." 

A loud rumble interrupted the youth. A 
huge, dark mass came slowly down to them. 
A blinding light flooded the whole glade. 
The striped cats were enclosed in soft con-
tainers such as were used for fragile goods. 
The big airship, poorly visible in the dark-
ness, disappeared, leaving the glade to the 

calm light of the stars. One of the five lads 
had gone off with the tigers and Mven Mass 
had been given his horse. 

Mven's horse and Chara's walked along 
side by side. The path led down to the valley 
of the River Galle at whose mouth, on the 
sea-coast, the medical station and Destroyer 
Battalion base were situated. 

"This is the first time I've been to the sea 
since I came to the island," said Mven Mass, 
breaking the silence. "Until now it has seemed 
to me that the sea is a wall that I'm forbidden 
to cross and which marks off my world." 

"The island has been a new school for 
you," 
said Chara joyfully 
but 
half-ques-
tioningly. 

"Yes, in a short time here I've experienced 
a lot and have done some new thinking. All 
these ideas I've had on my mind for a long 
time..." 

Mven Mass told her about his fears that 
man, by repeating the mistakes of the past, 
even if in a much less ugly form, is developing 
in a too rational, too technical manner. It 
seemed to Mven that on the planet of Epsilon 
Tucanae there was a mankind very much like 
ours and very beautiful in body that had 
paid greater attention to the perfection of 
the emotional side of the psyche. 

"I've suffered a great deal from this sense 
of imperfect harmony with life," answered 
the girl after a pause. "I've always wanted 
more of the old and much less of what is 
around me. I dreamed of the epoch that had 
not expended the strength and feelings accu-

mulated in the primitive period, the Age of 
Eros in Mediterranean Antiquity. It would be 
a good thing for the Great World to set up a 
reservation for the Life of Antiquity where 
we could rest and acquire emotional strength. 
I have always tried to arouse a real strength 
of feeling in my audiences but, I'm afraid, 
only Evda Nahl has fully understood me!" 

"And 
Mven Mass!" added the 
African, 
seriously, telling her how she had appeared 
to 
him 
as the copper-coloured 
daughter 
of Tucanae. The girl raised her face and in the 
timid light of early dawn Mven Mass saw eyes 
so big and profound that he felt a slight dizzi-
ness, moved away from her and laughed. 

"There was a time when our ancestors in 
their novels about the future imagined us as 
weakly, rickety beings with overgrown skulls. 
Despite the millions of animals that were tor-
mented and slaughtered in the name of science 
they did not come any nearer to an under-
standing of the brain mechanism of man and 
simply because they used a knife where the 
most delicate measuring instruments in the 
molecule and atom range were needed. We 
now know that strong intellectual activity 
requires a powerful body, fully of vital energy 
and that that body will produce strong emo-
tions that we have so far learned only to sup-
press and, by suppressing them, make our-
selves the poorer!" 

"We are still chained to the intellect," 
agreed Chara. 

" A lot has been done but the intellectual 
side continues to advance while the emotional 

lags behind and that is what must be looked 
after—so that emotion should not demand an 
intellectual chain but that reason should at 
times need emotion's chains. I have come 
to regard this as so important that I intend 
to write a book about." 

"Oh, of course," exclaimed Chara enthu-
siastically, but grew timid and continued, 
"very 
few 
great 
scientists 
have 
devoted 
themselves to research into the laws of the 
beautiful and the fullness of emotions—I'm 
not talking about psychology." 

" I can understand you," answered the Afri-
can, admiring the girl who, in her confusion, 
had raised her proud head higher to the rays 
of the rising sun that again gave her skin the 
colour of burnished copper. Chara sat easily 
and lightly on the big black horse that walked 
in step with Mven Mass's roan. 

"We are lagging behind!" exclaimed the girl, 
slackening her reins and urging her horse for-
ward. The African overtook her and they can-
tered together along the smooth old road. 
They soon caught up with the others, reined 
in their horses and again Chara turned to 
Mven Mass. 

"What about that girl, Onar?" 
"She must go to the Great World. You 
said yourself that she had remained on the 
island quite by chance because she was at-
tached to her mother who came here and 
died recently. It would be good for Onar 
to work with Veda, women's gentle and sen-
sitive hands are needed at the excavations... 
And there are thousands of other jobs for 

which they are needed... and Beth Lohn, 
the new Beth Lohn who will come back with 
us, he'll find her in a new way." 

Chara frowned and the bird that flew over 
her eyes spread its wings still more widely. 

"And you won't leave your stars?" 
"Whatever the decision of the Council may 
be I shall continue my study of the Cosmos. 
But first I have to write..." 

"About the stars of the human soul?" 
"Quite right, Chara! So great is their varie-
ty that it takes my breath away." Noticing 
that the girl was smiling gently at him, Mven 
Mass stopped. "Don't you agree?" 

"Of course I do. I was thinking about your 
experiment. You did it out of your passion-
ately impatient desire to give people the full-
ness of the world. In that you were an artist 
and not a scientist." 

"And Renn Bose?" 
"He's different. For him the experiment 
was another step forward in his research but 
one that science required." 

"You don't blame me, Chara?" 
"No! Nor do many other people, the majo-
rity, I'm sure!" 

Mven Mass took the reins in his left hand 
and held out his right to Chara. They entered 
the tiny group of houses around the sta-
tion. 

The waves of the Indian Ocean beat rhyth-
mically at the foot of the cliff. In the sounds 
they made Mven Mass could hear the rhyth-
mic beat of the basses in Zieg Zohr's sym-

phony depicting life reaching out into the 
Cosmos. There was one powerful note, a 
strong F, the basic note in terrestrial nature, 
that sang over the sea and compelled man to 
respond with his entire soul, merging with the 
nature that gave him birth. 

The sea was transparent, shining, cleansed 
of the relics of the past, of predatory sharks, 
poisonous fish, molluscs and medusae in the 
same way as the life of present-day man 
has been cleansed of the evil and fear of 
past centuries. But somewhere in the distant 
corners of the boundless ocean the seeds of 
harmful life have survived and we have the 
Destroyer Battalions to thank for keeping 
our ocean waters safe and clean. 

And is it not true that in the same way 
there suddenly arises savage stubbornness, 
the self-confidence of the cretin, the egoism 
of the beast in the transparent soul of youth? 
If man today does not submit to the authori-
ty of society that is directed towards wisdom 
and goodness but, instead, is guided by 
his own accidental ambition and individual 
passions, courage is turned into bestiality, 
creative activity into cruel cunning while 
loyalty and self-abnegation become the bul-
wark of tyranny, cruel exploitation and abase-
ment. The surface layer of discipline and so-
cial culture is easily torn off, only one or two 
generations of poor living are needed. Mven 
Mass had glanced into the face of the beast 
rhere, on the Island of Oblivion. If he is not 
restrained, if he had his way, a monstrous 
despotism will come into being that will 

crush everything underfoot and bring back 
that ruthless arbitrariness that held mankind 
enslaved for so many centuries. 

The most astounding thing in world history 
is the emergence of that undying hatred for 
knowledge and beauty that is typical of all 
vicious ignoramuses. This mistrust, fear and 
hatred are to be found in all human commu-
nities, beginning with fear of the primitive 
witches and witch-doctors and continuing 
up to the beating of those thinkers who were 
ahead of their time in the Era of Disunity. 
The same thing occurred on other planets 
with highly-developed civilizations that had 
not 
succeeded 
in 
protecting their 
social 
systems from the arbitrary action of small 
groups of people, oligarchies, that emerged 
suddenly and cunningly in the most diverse 
forms. Mven Mass recalled that the same 
thing had been reported over the Great Circle 
about 
other 
inhabited worlds where 
the 
highest achievements of science were used 
to intimidate, for torture and punishment, 
for thought-reading and turning the masses 
into obedient semi-idiots ever ready to ful-
fil the most monstrous orders. A cry for 
help from such a planet had reached the 
Circle and flown on into space many hund-
reds of years after the people who sent it 
and their cruel rulers had perished. 

Our planet is now at a stage of develop-
ment when such horrors are inconceivable. 
But man's spiritual development is still insuf-
ficient and people like Evda Nahl are working 
on the problem. 

"How can you get so deep in thought?" 
came 
Chara's 
voice 
from 
behind. 
"The 
artist Cart Sann said that wisdom is the com-
bination of knowledge and feelings." As she 
walked along the girl threw off her bathrobe. 
"Let's use that wisdom!" 

Chara ran past the African and dived from 
the height into the noisy swirl below. Mven 
Mass saw her jump forward, turn a somer-
sault, spread her arms and disappear into 
the waves. The 
lads from the 
Destroyer 
Battalion, 
bathing 
down 
below, 
were 
suddenly silent. A cold shiver of admiration 
verging on fright ran down 
Mven's back. 
The African had never dived from such a 
crazy height but he now stood without a 
tremor on the edge of the cliff and took off 
his clothes. He later remembered that in hazy 
momentary thoughts, Chara seemed like an 
ancient goddess to him, a goddess that could 
do anything. If she could, then so could he! 

A faint cry of warning from the girl arose 
out of the waves but Mven Mass did not 
hear it as he dived down. The flight was 
blissfully long. Mven Mass, a skilled diver, 
entered the water perfectly and his dive 
carried him a long way down. The water was 
so amazingly transparent that the seabed 
seemed dangerously close. He twisted his 
body upwards and the impact of unspent 
inertia was so terrific that for a moment 
everything ceased to exist for him. With the 
velocity of a rocket Mven Mass flew to the 
surface, rolled over on to his back and lay 
rocked by the waves. When he opened his 

eyes he saw Chara swimming towards him, 
the paleness of fright dulling the bronze of 
her sunburn. There was both reproach and ad-
miration in her eyes. 

"Why did you do that?" she whispered, 
hardly breathing. 

"Because you did. I'll follow you anywhere 
to build my Epsilon Tucanae on our Earth!" 

"Will you come back to the Great World 
with me?" 

"Yes!" 
Mven Mass turned over to swim farther and 
gave a shout of amazement. The astounding 
transparency of the water that had played 
such a nasty trick on him seemed even greater 
out there, farther from the beach. He and 
Chara seemed to be floating at a dizzy height 
over the seabed every detail of which showed 
as clearly through the pure water as it would 
through the air. Mven Mass was brimming 
over with courage and triumph such as people 
experience when they get outside the bounds 
of terrestrial gravitation. Journeys across the 
ocean in a storm, leaps into the black gulf 
of 
the 
Cosmos 
from 
artificial 
satellites 
aroused similar feelings of boundless daring 
and success. Mven Mass in a single spurt 
swam up to Chara, whispered her name and 
read a fervent response in her clear and cou-
rageous eyes. Their hands and lips joined over 
the crystal gulf. 

Chapter Twelve 

THE A S T R O N A U T I C A L C O U N C I L 

The Astronautical Council, like the planet's 
central brain, the Economic Council, had for 
centuries 
possessed 
its 
own 
building 
for 
scientific conferences. It was believed that 
specially 
designed 
and 
decorated 
rooms 
would attune the assembled scientists to the 
Cosmos and in this way facilitate their rapid 
mental 
transition 
from 
matters 
terrestrial 
to matters astral. 

Chara Nandi had never before been inside 
the main hall of the Council building. She 
was excited when she and Evda Nahl entered 
that strange, egg-shaped hall with its curved, 
parabolic ceiling and its rows of seats ar-
ranged in ellipses. The hall was drenched in a 
bright, transparent light that seemed to have 
been collected from some other star brighter 

than the Sun. All the lines of the walls, ceiling 
and seats converged at the end of the huge 
hall that seemed to be their natural focal 
point. At that point there was a dais with a 
screen, a rostrum and seats for the members 
of the Council who conducted the meetings. 

The dull gold panels of the walls alternated 
with 
relief maps of the planets. On the 
right-hand side there were maps of the solar 
system and on the left the planets of neigh-
bouring stars that had been studied by the 
Council's expeditions. A second series under 
the pale-blue dome of the ceiling carried 
diagrams of other inhabited stellar systems 
done in radiant colours; these had been re-
ceived from the Great Circle. 

Chara's attention was drawn to an old, 
faded picture over the rostrum that had appar-
ently been restored several times. A violet-
black sky occupied the entire upper half of 
the huge canvas. The tiny crescent of an 
alien moon cast a deathly white light on the 
uplifted stern of an ancient spaceship harshly 
silhouetted against the ruddy glow of a sett-
ing sun. The rows of ugly blue plants, coarse 
and dry, seemed to be made of metal. A man 
in a light spacesuit was dragging his feet 
through deep sand. He was looking back at 
the wrecked ship and the dead bodies of his 
companions. 
The eyeglasses of 
his mask 
reflected only the setting sun but by some 
trick of infinite skill the artist had managed 
to put into them an expression of the hope-
less despair of loneliness in a strange world. 
Something 
living, formless and disgusting. 

was crawling over a nearby sand hummock. 
There was a title under the picture in big 
letters, as brief as it was expressive: 
Left 
Alone! 

So impressed was she by the picture that 
the girl did not at first notice a wonderful 
architectural feature of the hall: the seats 
spread out fanwise and were arranged in steps 
so that a separate gangway to each seat was 
provided 
from 
galleries 
running 
under 
the rows of chairs. Each row was cut off 
completely from its higher and lower neigh-
bours. Only when she sat down with Evda 
did Chara notice the ancient craftsmanship 
of the chairs, reading desks and barriers, all of 
which were made from real pearl-coloured 
African wood. Nobody today would waste 
so much time and effort on something that 
could be cast and polished in a few minutes. 
Perhaps it was due to the love of old things 
that lives in all people that Chara found the 
wood warmer and more full of life than plas-
tic. Gently she stroked the curved arms of 
her chair, all the time looking round the hall. 

As usual many people had gathered in the 
hall although powerful transmitters would 
carry telepictures of the proceedings over the 
whole planet. Mir Ohm, Secretary of the 
Council, opened the proceedings by the usual 
reading of brief announcements that had 
accumulated since the last meeting. Not a 
single unattentive face, not a single person oc-
cupied with his own thoughts, could have 
been found amongst the hundreds in the hall. 
A tactful attention to everything was a typi-

cal feature of the people of the Great Circle 
Era. 
Nevertheless 
Chara missed the 
first 
communication 
as she continued 
looking 
round the hall and reading citations from 
famous scientists written under the planet 
maps. She liked most of all an appeal to be 
receptive to natural phenomena written under 
the map of Jupiter: "Look how we are sur-
rounded by facts that we do not understand— 
they thrust themselves upon us but we neither 
see nor hear the great things hidden in their 
faint outlines and awaiting discovery." 
In 
another place, farther to the left, an inscrip-
tion said: "The curtain hiding the unknown 
cannot be lifted easily—it is only after per-
sistent labour, retreats and deviations that we 
begin to fathom true meanings and new 
boundless horizons open up before us. Never 
try to avoid that which at first seems useless 
and inexplicable, incomprehensible..." 

There came a movement on the rostrum 
and the lights in the hall went out. The 
strong, calm voice of the Council Secretary 
quivered with excitement. 

"You will now see that which was but 
recently considered impossible, a photograph 
of our Galaxy taken from the side. More than 
a hundred and fifty thousand years ago—one 
and a half galactic minutes—the inhabitants 
of planetary system..." Chara let the figures, 
which seemed to her to be meaningless, go, 
"in 
the 
Centaurus Constellation 
sent an 
appeal to the inhabitants of the Great Magel-
lanic Cloud, the only extra-galactic stellar 
system near us that we know to contain 

worlds inhabited by intelligences capable of 
communicating 
with 
our 
Galaxy 
through 
the Circle. We still cannot give the exact 
coordinates of the Magellanic planetary sys-
tem but we have received their transmission, a 
photograph of the Galaxy. Here it is!" 

On the huge screen a wide cluster of stars, 
narrowing towards the ends, gleamed with a 
distant silver light. The profound darkness of 
space drowned the edges of the screen. The 
same blackness filled the gaps between the 
smaller spiral branches with their ragged tips. 
A pale glow spread over a ring of spherical 
clusters, the oldest stellar system in our Uni-
verse. Flat stellar fields alternated with clouds 
and strips of black condensed matter. The 
photograph had been taken from an awkward 
angle, the Galaxy was taken diagonally and 
from above so that the central core was a 
scarcely visible burning convex mass in the 
centre of a thin lentil-shaped cluster. Obvious-
ly if we wanted to get a complete picture 
of our Galaxy we should have to ask more 
distant galaxies that were situated at a higher 
galactic latitude. Not once since the inception 
of the Great Circle had any of the galaxies 
shown signs of intelligent life. 

The people of Earth watched the screen 
intently. For the first time man could look 
at his stellar Universe from the side and from 
a terrific distance in space. 

It seemed to Chara that the entire planet 
was holding its breath as it looked at its 
Galaxy in millions of screens on all six con-
tinents and on all the oceans wherever islands 

of human life and labour were scattered. 

"That is the end of the news received by 
our observatories and not previously broad-
cast in the world news circuit," announced 
the Secretary in a calm voice. "We will now 
go over to projects submitted for general 
discussion. 

"Juta Gay's proposal to create an atmo-
sphere for Mars suitable for human respiration 
by means of the extraction of the light gases 
from deep-lying rocks deserves attention as 
it is supported by sound calculations. The 
air 
so 
produced 
will 
be 
sufficient 
for 
breathing and for the heat insulation of our 
settlements which will then be able to come 
out of their glass houses. Many years ago, 
after oceans of oil and mountains of hard 
carbohydrates 
were discovered on 
Venus, 
automatic 
installations 
were 
set 
working 
there 
to 
create 
an 
artificial 
atmosphere 
under a gigantic dome of transparent plastic. 
These installations enabled man to 
plant 
vegetation 
and build factories to 
provide 
tremendous quantities of everything organic 
chemistry could produce. 

"We 
usually 
announce 
new 
proposals 
ourselves," continued Mir Ohm, "but today 
you will hear an almost finished piece of 
research. Its author, Eva Djann, will give 
you material that will require most careful 
thought." 

The Secretary laid aside a metal sheet and 
smiled in a friendly way. At the end of the 
row of seats nearest to the rostrum Mven 
Mass appeared; in his dark-red costume he 

looked at once gloomy, solemn and calm. 
As a sign of respect for the assembly he raised 
his folded hands above his head and then sat 
down. 

Mir Ohm left the rostrum to make way 
for a young woman with short, golden hair 
and green eyes that had a look of permanent 
surprise in them. Grom Orme, the President 
of the Council, stood beside her. 

Eva Djann began speaking in a suppressed 
voice and was so shy that she seemed afraid 
to make the slightest movement. She started 
from the well-known fact that southern ve-
getation is distinguished by its blue foliage. 
This is a colour that is typical of ancient 
forms of vegetable life on Earth. An investi-
gation of plant life on other planets had 
shown that blue foliage belongs to an atmos-
phere that is either more transparent than 
that of Earth or to one that is subjected to 
greater ultra-violet radiation from its luminary 
than Earth is from the Sun. It had long been 
known, she said, that the Sun, whose red 
radiation is stable, shows great instability at 
the blue and ultra-violet end of the spectrum. 
About two million years earlier there had 
been a sharp change in the Sun's ultra-violet 
radiation that had continued over a lengthy 
period. 
It was then that the blue foliage 
appeared, the birds and beasts of the open 
spaces acquired black protective covering and 
birds that nested in the open began laying 
black eggs. 

At this time Earth's axis lost its stability 
owing to 
changes in 
the 
electromagnetic 

regime of the solar system. For a long time 
astronomers had based their calculations on 
the mechanics of gravitation alone and had 
paid no attention to electromagnetic equilib-
rium which is much more changeable than 
gravitation. 

There had long been in existence schemes 
for the transfer of seas into depressions on 
the continents in order to bring about a shift 
of Earth's axis. If this problem be approached 
from the standpoint of the electromagnetic 
forces of the system and not as a problem in 
elementary mechanics it would be more easily 
and cheaply achievable. It would be remem-
bered, she continued, that in the early days 
of space travel 
the creation 
of 
artificial 
gravitation had required such a tremendous 
expenditure of power that it had been practi-
cally 
impossible. 
Since 
the discovery 
of 
meson forces, however, our spaceships had 
been equipped with simple and reliable arti-
ficial gravity installations. And Ftenn Bose's 
experiment had indicated a way of by-passing 
gravitation. 

Eva Djann stopped. A group of six people, 
the heroes of the Pluto Expedition, seated in 
the centre of the hall, applauded her by ex-
tending 
their 
folded 
hands. 
The 
young 
woman's cheeks flushed for a moment before 
the screen lit up with the phantom contours 
of stereometric drawings. 

" I realize that the problem is one that can 
be developed on a wider scale and that we 
can then think of changing the orbits of 
planets and bringing Pluto nearer to the 

Sun. But so far I have in mind only the shift-
ing of the Earth's axis of rotation to improve 
climatic conditions on the continental hemi-
sphere. Renn Bose's experiment showed the 
possibility of the inversion of the gravitational 
field in its second aspect, that is, in the as-
pect of the electromagnetic field, with subse-
quent vectoral polarization in these direc-
tions," she pointed to geometric figures on 
the screen that had become elongated and 
were rotating. "Earth's axis of rotation would 
lose its stability and the planet could be 
turned in the desired direction for the better 
illumination of the continents." 

Rows of parameters that had been comput-
ed by machines beforehand now appeared on 
the long glass under the screen and everybody 
who 
could understand them saw that Eva 
Djann's project was, at any rate, not without 
sound foundation. 

Eva Djann stopped the movement of the 
drawings and symbols and, her head bowed, 
left the rostrum. 
Her audience exchanged 
glances and whispered amongst themselves. 
The young commander of the Pluto Expedi-
tion, exchanging a scarcely perceptible glance 
with 
Grom 
Orme, mounted the 
rostrum. 

"There is no doubt that Renn Bose's expe-
riment will have a trigger effect and set off a 
chain of important discoveries. It seems to me 
to be leading us to distant vistas of science 
that were formerly unattainable. It was the 
same way 
with the quantum 
theory—the 
first approach to an understanding of the 
repagulum or mutual transition with the sub-

sequent discovery of the antiparticle and the 
antifield. Then came the repagular calculus 
that scored a victory over the principle of 
indefiniteness proposed by the ancient mathe-
matician Geisenberg. And, lastly, Renn Bose 
made the next step, the analysis of the space-
field system, leading to an understanding of 
antigravitation and antispace, or, by the re-
pagulum law, to zero space. All the formerly 
unaccepted theories have, in the long run, 
become the foundations of science! 

"In the name of the Pluto exploration 
group 
I propose transmitting the problem 
over the universal information network for 
general discussion. The inclination of Earth's 
axis would reduce the expenditure of energy 
for the warming of the polar regions, would 
smooth out the polar fronts and increase the 
planet's water supply." 

"Is the question now being submitted to 
the vote clear to everybody?" asked Grom 
Orme. 

A large number of green lights flashed up in 
answer to the question. 

"All right, we'll begin," said the President 
and pushed his hand under the book-rack in 
front of his seat. There were three buttons 
there connected with a calculating machine, 
the one on the right signalled "yes", the mid-
dle one, "no" and the one on the left "ab-
stain". Every member of the Council sent a 
signal which the others could not see. Evda 
Nahl and Chara also pressed buttons working 
a separate machine which counted the votes 
of the audience as a check on the correct-

ness of the Council's decision. 

A few seconds later large symbols appeared 
on the demonstration screen—the problem 
had been accepted for discussion by the 
whole planet. 

Grom Orme took the floor. 
"For a reason that I shall not disclose until 
the case is over, we shall now examine the 
action of Mven Mass, the former Director of 
the Outer Stations of the Astronautical Coun-
cil and will then decide the question of the 
38th Cosmic Expedition. Does the Council 
believe that I have sufficient motives for my 
request?" 

Green lights signalled unanimous consent. 
"Does everybody know the details of what 
happened?" 

Again a flash of green lights. 
"That will speed up our business! I will 
ask Mven Mass, the former Director, to out-
line his motives for an action that had such 
dire results. The physicist, Renn Bose, has not 
yet sufficiently recovered from his injuries 
and has not been sent for as a witness. So 
he cannot be held responsible for the experi-
ment." 

Grom Orme noticed a red light burning 
at Evda Nahl's seat. 

"Attention everybody! 
Evda Nahl wants 
to make an additional statement about Renn 
Bose." 

"I 
would like to speak in his place." 

"What are your motives?" 
"I love him!" 
"You may speak after Mven Mass." 

Evda Nahl extinguished the red light and 
sat down. 

Mven 
Mass appeared 
on the 
rostrum. 
Calmly, in no way excusing himself, he told 
of the results that were expected from the 
experiment, related what had actually hap-
pened and the vision in which he did not 
quite believe. Their foolish hurry in carrying 
out the experiment on account of the secre-
tiveness and illegality of their action, left 
them no time to devise special recording 
machines, they had relied on the usual memo-
ry machines and they had been destroyed 
in the first instant. Another mistake had 
been the conduct of the experiment through 
the satellite. They ought to have attached an 
old planetship to Satellite 57 and set up 
instruments on it to orientate the vector. 
He, Mven Mass, was guilty in all respects. 
Renn Bose made the arrangements for the 
ground 
installation 
but 
the 
transmission 
of the experiment into the Cosmos was exclu-
sively the competency of the Director of the 
Outer Stations. 

Chara clenched her fists, 
Mven 
Mass's 
self-accusation seemed weighty enough to 
her. 

"Did the observers on the satellite know 
that 
a 
catastrophe 
was 
the 
possible 
outcome?" asked Grom Orme. 

"Yes, they were warned and willingly gave 
their consent." 

"I am not surprised that they consented, 
thousands of young people take part in dan-
gerous 
experiments 
that 
are carried 
out 

every year on the planet and it sometimes 
happens that they are killed. And new volun-
teers come to the fore undaunted," said Grom 
Orme, grimly, "to do battle with the unknown. 
When you, however, warned the young people, 
you were showing that you suspected that 
such an outcome was possible. Nevertheless 
you carried out a risky experiment without 
even taking the necessary steps to ensure that 
definite results would be obtained." 

Mven Mass lowered his head in silence 
and Chara suppressed a profound sigh, feeling 
Evda Nahl's hand on her shoulder. 

"Outline the motives that led you to under-
take the experiment," 
said the 
President 
after a pause. 

Mven Mass spoke again, this time with 
impassioned excitement. He said that from 
early youth he had always regarded as a re-
proach the millions of nameless graves of 
people defeated by inexorable time, and that 
he could not allow this opportunity to pass, 
for the first time in the history of this and 
neighbouring worlds, of making an attempt 
at the conquest of space and time, of erect-
ing the first landmarks on that great path, a 
path which many great minds would follow... 
He did not believe that he had the right to 
postpone, perhaps for a century, this experi-
ment, merely because he was subjecting a 
few people to danger and himself to great 
responsibility. 

Mven Mass spoke and Chara's heart beat 
faster in pride for her chosen fiance. Now the 
African's guilt did not seem so great. 

Mven Mass returned to his place and stood 
there waiting, in view of all. 

Evda Nahl handed over a record of Renn 
Bose's speech. His weak, gasping voice filled 
the hall through the amplifiers. The physi-
cist exonerated Mven Mass. As he did not 
know all the implications of the experiment 
the Director of the Outer Stations could do 
nothing but trust him, Renn Bose, and he 
had convinced him that success was certain. 
The physicist, however, did not consider 
that he was in any way to blame, either. 
Every year, he said, important experiments 
are mounted and some of them have a tragic 
end. Science is a struggle for the happiness 
of man and it demands its victims in the same 
way as any other struggle. Cowards who are 
afraid to risk their own skins never know 
the fullness and joy of living, nor do such 
scientists ever make any advances. 

Renn Bose concluded with a brief explana-
tion of the experiment and an analysis of the 
mistakes and expressed his confidence in fu-
ture successes. The tape-recorder stopped. 

"Renn Bose did not say anything about 
his 
observations 
during the 
experiment," 
said Grom Orme, raising his head and address-
ing Evda Nahl. "You wanted to speak in his 
place." 

" I 
expected that question and for that 
reason asked for the floor," answered Evda. 
"Renn Bose lost consciousness a few seconds 
after the F stations were switched in and did 
not see anything else. On the verge of con-
sciousness he noticed and remembered only 

the readings of the instruments that indicated 
zero space. Here is his record from memory." 

A few figures appeared on the screen and 
were immediately copied down by 
many 
people. 

"Allow 
me to add on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Academy of Sorrow and Joy," said Evda, 
"that a poll of public opinion taken since the 
catastrophe gives the following..." 

A series of eight-figure numbers flashed on 
the screen in columns headed 
condemnation, 
exoneration, 
doubt 
with 
regard 
to the 
scien-
tific 
approach 
and 
accusation 
of 
haste. 
The total 
was undoubtedly 
in favour 
of 
Mven Mass and Renn Bose: the faces of 
those present brightened up. 

A red light was switched on at the far end 
of the hall and Grom Orme gave the floor to 
Pour 
Hyss, the astronomer 
of 
the 
37th 
Cosmic Expedition. 
He spoke loudly and 
temperamentally, waving his long arms and 
stretching his neck so that his Adam's apple 
was prominent. 

" A 
group of us, astronomers, condemn 
Mven Mass. The conduct of an experiment 
without the sanction of the Council was an 
act of cowardice that gives rise to the suspi-
cion that his action was not as selfless as it 
would appear from what has been said." 

Chara burned with indignation and only 
remained in her seat in obedience to Evda 
Nahl's cold glance. 

Pour Hyss finished his speech. 
"Your accusation is a serious one but not 
clearly worded," said Mven Mass when the 

President gave him the floor. "Will you please 
explain what you mean by cowardice and 
selfishness?" 

"Immortal 
fame should the experiment 
succeed—that 
is the thought of self that 
underlies your experiment. And I say cowar-
dice 
because 
you 
were afraid that 
you 
would not get permission for the experiment 
and conducted it hastily and in secret!" 

Mven Mass's face expanded in a smile, he 
spread his arms like a child and sat down 
without speaking again. Pour Hyss was the 
very picture of malignant triumph. 

Evda 
Nahl again asked for 
the 
floor. 

"I do not see any grounds for Pour Hyss's 
suspicions. His statement was made too hur-
riedly and too maliciously for the solution of 
such a grave question. His views on the secret 
motives underlying people's actions belong 
to the Dark Ages. Only people of the distant 
past could speak in that way about immortal 
fame. They did not know the joy and full-
ness of real life, they did not feel that they 
were particles of mankind engaged in collec-
tive creative activity, they were afraid of 
inevitable death and clung to the faintest 
hope of immortality. Pour Hyss, a scientist, 
an astronomer, does not understand that 
only those remain alive in the memory of 
mankind whose ideas, will and achievements 
remain active and once their activity has 
ceased the people are forgotten. It is a long 
time since I came into contact with such a prim-
itive understanding of immortality and fame 
and am amazed to find it in a Cosmic explorer." 

Evda Nahl stretched herself to full height 
and turned towards Pour Hyss who cringed in 
his chair illuminated by a large number of 
red lights of disapproval. 

"Let us put aside all absurdity," continued 
Evda Nahl, "and examine the action of Mven 
Mass and Renn Bose by the criterion of 
human happiness. They were advancing along 
an untrodden path. I do not possess sufficient 
knowledge in their field but it is obvious, 
even to me, that their experiment was prema-
ture. In that respect both are guilty and are 
responsible both for considerable 
material 
losses, and also for the loss of four human 
lives. This, by the laws of Earth, constitutes 
a crime, but it was not committed for person-
al gain and, therefore, does not merit heavy 
punishment. The noble aspirations of the 
chief accused, Mven Mass, should be regarded 
as an extenuating circumstance." 

Evda Nahl returned slowly to her place. 
Grom Orme asked if anyone else wished 
to 
speak 
but 
nobody 
responded. 
The 
members of the Council asked the President 
to propose final judgement. The thin, wiry 
figure of Grom Orme leaned forward on the 
rostrum and his piercing glance penetrated 
to the back of the hall. 

"The circumstances on which we have to 
give judgement are quite simple. I do not 
hold 
Renn Bose in any way 
responsible. 
What scientist would not take advantage of 
such 
possibilities, 
placed at 
his 
disposal, 
especially if he were certain of success? The 
disastrous failure 
of 
the 
experiment 
will 

serve as a lesson. There has, however, been 
something gained that 
will, to a certain 
extent, recompense us for the material losses; 
the experiment will help solve a number of 
problems that the Academy of the Bounds 
of Knowledge has only just begun to think 
about. 

"We have long since given up petty econo-
mies when it comes to the solution of great 
problems or the employment of our produc-
tive forces and have abandoned the tendency 
to utilitarian adaptation typical of the old 
economic system. Problems that arise during 
the reconstruction of production processes 
or during research are solved on a grand 
scale. Even today, however, the moment of 
success is sometimes incorrectly understood 
because there are people who forget that 
the laws of development are immutable. It 
seems to them that progress must be endless... 

"The wisdom of a leader lies in his ability 
to recognize the highest permissible level at 
a given stage and in his ability to stop, 
wait or change his course. Mven Mass has 
proved 
incapable of such leadership. The 
Council made a wrong choice and the Council 
are as much responsible as the man they 
selected. In the first place I am at fault myself, 
since 
I 
supported 
the 
proposal 
of 
two 
members of the Council to invite Mven Mass 
for the post. 

"I 
propose that the Council exonerate 
Mven Mass as having acted from the highest 
motives but forbid him to occupy any post 
in the governing bodies of the planet. I should 

also be removed from my position as Presi-
dent of the Council and sent to make good 
the damage done by my unfortunate choice—I 
should help build the new satellite." 

Grom Orme cast a glance round the hall 
and saw the sincere regret expressed on many 
faces. The people of the Great Circle Era, 
however, did not try to persuade one another 
but respected other people's decisions and 
trusted to their correctness. 

Mir Ohm discussed the matter with the 
other members of the Council and the calcu-
lating machine announced the result of the 
voting. Grom Orme's proposal was accepted 
without dissension but with the proviso that 
he conduct the present meeting to the end of 
the session. 

He bowed and his face, controlled by his 
iron will, did not change its expression. 

" I must now explain my reason for post-
poning the discussion of the Cosmic Expedi-
tion," continued the President in a calm 
voice. " I t was obvious that the matter would 
end favourably and I think the Control of 
Honour and Justice will agree with us. I may 
now ask Mven Mass to take his seat in the 
Council as we are faced with a serious dis-
cussion. His knowledge is essential to us for 
the correct solution of our problems, especially 
as Erg Noor cannot participate in today's 
discussion." 

Mven Mass walked over to the Council 
seats and green lights of good-will flashed up 
all over the hall, lighting his way. 

The maps of the planets moved noiseless-

ly aside and their place was taken by grim 
black charts with the stars shown in coloured 
lights, the blue lines of the interstellar routes 
proposed for the next century linking them 
up. The President of the Council was a 
changed man. His cold passionless attitude 
had vanished, a warm glow lit up his greyish 
cheeks, his steel-grey eyes grew darker. Grom 
Orme mounted the rostrum. 

"Every Cosmic expedition is a long-che-
rished dream; it is a new hope that is carefully 
nurtured for many years, it is another step 
upward in the great ascent. It is also the la-
bour of millions of people for which there 
must be due recompense, a very substantial 
economic or scientific gain, otherwise our 
forward movement would cease and there 
would be no further victories over nature. 
That is why we enter into such detailed dis-
cussions and make such careful calculations 
before a new ship shoots off into interstellar 
space. 

" I t was our duty to send out the 37th 
Cosmic Expedition to learn the fate of Zirda 
instead of continuing our own exploration. 
To compensate for this we were able to dis-
cuss the 38th Expedition more thoroughly. 

" A number of events that occurred last 
year have brought changes that necessitate a 
re-examination of the route and objectives 
of the expedition that had been approved 
by previous Councils and by a planet-wide 
discussion. The discovery of methods of pro-
cessing alloys under high pressure at absolute 
zero temperature gives us material of higher 

durability 
for 
the 
hulls 
of 
the 
ships. 
Anameson motors have been improved and 
are now more economical which, of course, 
increases the ship's radius of activity. The 
spaceships Ae/la 
and 
Tintagelle 
that 
had 
been earmarked for the 38th Expedition are 
now out of date in comparison with the 
newly 
built 
Lebed, 
a round-hulled vessel 
of the vertical type with four stability keels. 
Longer flights are becoming possible. 

"Erg Noor, now back from the 37th Expe-
dition, has informed us of his meeting with a 
black star of the T class, on whose planet his 
expedition 
discovered 
a 
spaceship 
of 
unknown construction. Efforts made to enter 
it nearly cost the whole party their lives but 
they managed to bring back a piece of the 
metal of its hull. It is a substance that we do 
not know, here on Earth, although it resembles 
the 14th isotope of silver discovered on the 
planets of the very hot 0 8 class star long since 
known by the name of Zeta Carinae. 

"The spaceship is a disc, convex on both 
sides, with a crudely spiral surface, a design 
that has been discussed by the Academy of 
the Bounds of Knowledge. 

"Junius Antus has been through the infor-
mation records of the Great Circle for the 
entire eight hundred years since we joined it. 
A spaceship of this type cannot be built by 
science and engineering that follow our line 
of development and are at our present level 
of knowledge. Such ships are unknown in 
those worlds of the Galaxy with whom we 
have exchanged information. 

" A disc spaceship of such gigantic propor-
tions is undoubtedly a visitor from some in-
conceivably 
distant 
planet, perhaps, even, 
from some extra-galactical world. It could 
have continued its journey millions of years 
after the death of its crew before landing on 
the planet of the iron star in our desert re-
gion on the fringe of the Galaxy. 

"There is no need for me to enlarge on the 
importance of a study of that ship by a spe-
cial expedition to star T." 

Grom Orme switched on the hemispherical 
screen and the hall disappeared. The records 
of the memory machines moved slowly across 
the screen. 

"This is a recently received communication 
from planet CR 519—1 will omit the detailed 
coordinates for the sake of 
brevity—about 
their expedition to the Achernar system." 

The positions of the stars seemed peculiar 
and even the most experienced eye could 
not recognize well-known heavenly bodies. 
The screen showed patches of dully luminous 
gas, dark clouds and, lastly, huge dead planets 
that reflected the light of a terrifically bright 
star. 

Achernar had a diameter only three and a 
half times that of our Sun but its luminosity 
was 280 times greater: it was an indescribab-
ly 
bright 
blue star belonging to spectral 
class 
The spaceship that had made the 
record had travelled a long way to one side, 
dozens of years' journey, perhaps. 

Another 
star 
appeared on the 
screen, 
a bright green star of class S. It grew in size, 

became brighter and brighter as the spaceship 
from another world drew nearer to it. The 
surface of a new planet then appeared. It 
showed a country of high mountains clothed 
in 
every 
possible 
shade of 
green. 
Deep 
canyons and steep slopes were marked by 
dark green, almost black shadows, the gentler 
slopes and valleys were bathed in greens in 
which a blue tint predominated, the snow 
on the mountain tops and high plateaux was 
aquamarine and there were also patches of 
yellowish green where the sun had scorched 
the earth. 
Rivers the colour of malachite 
ran down slopes to lakes and seas hidden 
beyond the mountains. 

Next came a plain dotted with round hills 
that stretched as far as a sea that from a 
distance 
looked like a gleaming sheet of 
green iron. Blue trees carried masses of dense 
foliage and the glades were bright with purple 
strips and patches of unknown bushes and 
grasses. Gold-green rays came in a mighty 
stream from the amethyst heavens. The earth-
lings were dazzled by the beauty of the 
planet. 
Mven 
Mass searched his 
encyclo-
paedic memory for the exact coordinates of 
the green star. 

"Achernar is Alpha Eridani, it is high up in 
the southern sky not far from Tucanae... dis-
tance—21 parsecs ... the return of a spaceship 
with the same crew is impossible," were the 
thoughts 
that 
flashed through 
his 
mind. 

The screen was switched off and the sight 
of the closed hall, adapted for contemplation 
and conferences by Earth-dwellers, seemed 

suddenly strange to behold. 

"That green star," the voice of the Presi-
dent continued, "with an abundance of zir-
conium in its spectrum, is slightly larger than 
our Sun." Here Grom Orme gave the coordi-
nates of the zirconium star very rapidly. 

"There are two planets in its system," he 
continued. "They are twins revolving opposite 
each other at a distance from the star that en-
sures them about the same amount of energy 
as Earth receives from the Sun. 

"The depth and composition of the at-
mosphere and the amount of water are similar 
to those of Earth. These are the preliminary 
data obtained by the expedition sent out 
from planet CR 519. The same report speaks 
of the absence of intelligent life on the twin 
planets. Higher forms of intelligent life trans-
form nature to such an extent that it is vis-
ible even from a spaceship flying at a great 
height. We must assume that higher forms of 
life have not been able to develop or have 
not yet developed there. This is unusually 
favourable to us. If there were higher forms 
of life there the planets would be closed 
to us. In year 72 of the Great Circle Era, 
over seven centuries ago, our world discussed 
the 
question 
of 
settling 
a 
planet 
with 
higher forms of intelligent life even if they 
had not reached our level of civilization. 
It was then decided that any invasion of such 
a planet would only lead to acts of violence 
due to the profoundest 
misunderstandings. 

"We now know how great is the diversity 
of worlds in our Galaxy. There are blue, 

green, yellow, white, red and orange stars; 
they are all of the hydrogen-helium type but 
their mantles and cores are of different compo-
sition—carbon, 
cyanogen, 
titanium, 
zirco-
nium—and they have different kinds of radia-
tion, high or low temperatures and atmo-
spheres of different composition. There are 
planets whose volume, density, depth and 
composition of atmosphere and hydrosphere, 
distance from their sun, conditions of ro-
tation all differ very greatly. We also know 
that our planet, with water covering seventy 
per cent of its surface in combination with 
its proximity to the Sun that pours a tremen-
dous amount of energy on to it, enjoys con-
ditions favouring the development of power-
ful living organisms, a rich variety of biologi-
cal forms that are undergoing constant trans-
formation, a case that is not often met with in 
the Universe. 

"Life on our planet, therefore, developed 
more quickly than in other worlds where it 
is hampered by a shortage of water or solar 
energy or by insufficient dry land. And more 
quickly, too, than on the planets that have 
too much water! In the Circle transmissions 
we have seen the evolution of life on the 
planets that are under water, life that is 
crawling desperately upwards on stems of 
plants sticking out of the water. 

"Our planet also has large expanses of 
water and the area of the continents is relati-
vely small for the accumulation of solar ener-
gy through food plants, trees or simply by 
means of thermoelectric installations. 

"In the earliest periods of Earth's history 
life developed more slowly in the swamps of 
the low-lying continents of the Paleozoic 
Era than it did on the high land of the Caino-
zoic where there was a struggle for water as 
well as for food. 

"We know that for an abundant and power-
ful life there must be a certain ratio of land 
to water and our planet is very close to the 
optimum in its composition. There are not 
many such planets in the Cosmos and every 
one of them is an invaluable acquisition for 
mankind as new land where man can settle 
and continue to develop. 

"Man has long since ceased to fear the 
catastrophic overpopulation that at one time 
greatly disturbed our distant ancestors, but 
still we persist in our exploration of the 
Cosmos, extending the region settled by our 
people, for this, too, is progress, this, too, 
is an unavoidable law of development. So 
great are the difficulties involved in settling 
on a planet with physical properties differing 
from those of Earth that there have long been 
projects in existence to settle man in the Cos-
mos on gigantic, specially constructed installa-
tions, something like our artificial satellites 
magnified many times over. You will remem-
ber that an island of this type was built on the 
eve of the Great Circle Era, Nadir, situated 
more than 18 million kilometres from Earth. 
A small colony of people still live there but 
the failure of such closely confined and re-
stricted quarters to satisfy the needs of human 
life if it is to spread boldly throughout the 

Cosmos is so obvious that we can only express 
amazement at our ancestors even though we 
admire the audacity of their engineering. 

"The twin planets of the green zirconium 
star are very similar to ours. They are unsuit-
able or difficult to settle for the fragile in-
habitants of planet CR 519 who discovered 
them and passed the information on to us in 
the same way as we pass our discoveries on 
to them. 

"The green star is situated at a greater 
distance from our planet than any spaceship 
has yet covered. If we reach the planets of 
that star we shall have moved far out into 
the Universe. We shall move forward, not on 
the tiny world of an artificial island but on 
big planets where there is every opportunity 
for the organization of comfortable life and 
for mighty technical achievements. 

"You now see why I have taken up so 
much of your time with a detailed descrip-
tion of the planets of the green star—they 
seem to me to be important objectives for 
exploration. The distance of seventy light 
years is feasible for a spaceship of the Lebed 
type and I think that we should, perhaps, 
send the 38th Cosmic Expedition to Acher-
nar!" 

Grom Orme finished at that point and re-
turned to his place, pushing over a switch on 
the rostrum as he did so. 

A small screen rose up before the audience 
and on it appeared the head and shoulders of 
Darr Veter, a massive figure known to many 
of those present. The former Director of the 

Outer Stations smiled as he was silently greet-
ed with flashing green lights. 

"Darr Veter is now in the Arizona Radio-
active Desert from where he is sending groups 
of rockets 57,000 kilometres into space to 
build a satellite," explained Grom Orme. "He 
wishes to speak and give his opinion as a 
member of the Council." 

" I 
propose the simplest 
possible solu-
tion," came his jolly voice to which the por-
table transmitter had added some metallic 
tones. "We should send out three expedi-
tions and not just one!" 

The members of the Council and the visi-
tors were taken completely by surprise. Darr 
Veter was no orator and did not take advan-
tage of the effective pause. 

"Our first plan was to send both spaceships 
of the 38th Expedition to the triple star 
EE7723..." 

Mven Mass immediately pictured the triple 
star that had been known as Omicron 2 Eri-
dani in olden times. It was situated less than 
five parsecs from the Sun and was a system of 
yellow, blue and red stars with two lifeless 
planets which in themselves were of no in-
terest. The blue star in this system was a 
white dwarf as big as one of the larger planets 
but with a mass half that of the Sun. The 
average specific weight of 
matter in that 
star was 2,500 times greater than that of 
Earth's heaviest metal, iridium. 

Gravitation, electromagnetic fields, thermal 
processes and the creation of heavy chemical 
elements on that star were of colossal interest 

and the importance of studying them at 
close quarters was very great, especially as 
the 10th Cosmic Expedition that had been 
sent to Sirius had been lost but had managed 
to send a danger signal. Sirius, a double blue 
star and near neighbour of the Sun, also 
possessed a white dwarf of lower temperature 
and larger dimensions than Omicron 2 Eridani 
and with a density twenty-five thousand times 
that of water. It proved impossible to reach 
this near star owing to gigantic streams of 
meteorites crossing each other and encircl-
ing the star; they were so widely dispersed 
that it was found impossible to determine 
the area over which these treacherous frag-
ments were spread. It was then that the ex-
pedition to Omicron 2 Eridani had first been 
mooted, 315 years before... 

"...Now, after the experiment made by 
Mven Mass and Renn Bose, it is of such 
importance that it cannot be rejected. 

"But then, the study of a strange spaceship 
from a far distant world may give us knowl-
edge that will by far exceed that acquired at 
the first examination. 

"We may ignore former safety regulations 
and send the ships out separately. 
Aella 
can be sent to Omicron 2 Eridani and Tin-
tagelle to star T. They are both first class 
spaceships like Tantra 
that managed alone 
against overwhelming odds." 

"Romanticism!" said Pour Hyss loudly and 
unceremoniously but cringed in his seat when 
he noticed the disapproval of the audience. 

"Yes, it is, it's genuine romanticism!" ex-

claimed Darr Veter, jauntily. "The very roman-
ticism that was not properly appreciated in 
the past when it was killed by literature, 
education and experience. 
Romanticism is 
nature's luxury but in a well-ordered society 
it is indispensable! A craving for something 
new, for frequent changes, is engendered in 
every person by a superfluity of physical and 
spiritual strength. From this emerges a parti-
cular attitude to the phenomena of life, a 
desire to see more than the even tread of 
humdrum everyday existence, the expectation 
that life will provide a greater quota of trials 
and impressions. 

" I 
can 
see 
Evda 
Nahl 
in 
the 
hall," 
continued Darr Veter, "and she'll tell you 
that romanticism is not only psychology but 
physiology as well! It is the task of our epoch 
to make romanticists of all the inhabitants 
of the planet. But let me continue: let us send 
the new spaceship Lebed to Achernar, to the 
green star, because we shall only know the 
result in a hundred and seventy years' time. 
Grom Orme is right in saying that the explora-
tion of similar planets and the establishment 
of bases for advance into the Cosmos is our 
duty to posterity." 

"We have anameson supplies for two ships 
only," objected Mir Ohm, the Council Sec-
retary. " I t will take ten years to build up sup-
plies for a third ship without interfering with 
our ecomony. I must also remind you that a 
large part of our production potential is 
going into the restoration of the satellite." 

" I have foreseen all that," answered Darr 

Veter, "and propose, if the Economic Council 
will agree, to appeal to the population of the 
planet. Let everybody abandon all pleasure 
trips and holiday journeys for one year, let 
us switch off the television cameras in our 
aquariums and in the ocean depths, let us 
stop bringing precious stones and rare plants 
from Venus and Mars and stop the factories 
producing clothing and ornaments. The Eco-
nomic Council can tell you better than I 
what must be stopped in order to economize 
energy to make anameson. Which of us would 
refuse to curtail his needs for one year only 
in order to make a wonderful gift to our 
children—two new planets in the vitalizing 
rays of a green sun so pleasant to terrestrial 
eyes!" 

Darr Veter spread out his arms as he ap-
pealed to the whole world, knowing that 
thousands of millions of eyes were on him; he 
nodded and disappeared, leaving a flickering 
bluish light behind. Out there, in the Ari-
zona Desert, a dull thunder shook the earth 
periodically as the rockets bore their loads 
way out beyond the blue vault of heaven. 
In the Council hall the whole audience rose 
to their feet and raised their left hands as 
an open expression of agreement with the 
speaker. 

The President of the Council turned to 
Evda Nahl. 

"Will our visitor from the Academy of Sor-
row and Joy please let us know her opinion 
from the standpoint of human happiness?" 

Evda Nahl went to the rostrum again. 

"The human psyche is so organized that it 
is incapable of lengthy excitation or frequent 
repetitions 
of 
excitation. 
This constitutes 
its defence against the rapid exhaustion of the 
nervous system. Our distant ancestors almost 
annihilated mankind by ignoring the fact 
that frequent rest is physiologically essential 
to man. We were at first afraid of repeating 
the mistake and began to take too much care 
of the psyche because we did not understand 
that the best way to get rid of impressions 
and to rest is to be found in work. A change 
of employment is essential but that is not a l l -
there must be a regular alternation of work 
and rest. The heavier the work the longer 
must be the rest and it will be seen that the 
harder the task performed the greater the 
pleasure it will bring, the more fully the 
worker will be absorbed in his task. 

"We may speak of happiness as a constant 
sequence of work and rest, of difficulties and 
pleasures. The longevity of man has widened 
the bounds of his world and he feels the urge 
to get out into the Cosmos. The struggle for 
the new—that's where we find real happi-
ness! From this we may conclude that the 
dispatch of a spaceship to Achernar would 
bring more direct happiness to mankind than 
any two other expeditions because the pla-
nets of the green sun will make a gift of a new 
world to our senses while the investigation 
of the physical phenomena of the Cosmos, 
despite all its significance, is so far perceived 
only by the intellect. In the struggle to in-
crease the sum of human happiness, the Aca-

demy of Sorrow and Joy would no doubt find 
the expedition to Achernar the most bene-
ficial, but if it is possible to dispatch all three 
expeditions, so much the better!" 

The excited audience rewarded Evda Nahl 
with a shower of green lights. 

Grom Orme rose to speak. 
"The question and the Council's decision 
have already been made clear so that my 
speech will, apparently, be the last. We are 
going to ask mankind to curtail consump-
tion for the year 809 of the Great Circle Era. 
Darr Veter did not mention the golden horse 
dating back to the Era of Disunity that the 
historians found. These hundreds of tons of 
pure gold can be used for the production of 
anameson so that a supply sufficient for the 
flights will soon be ready. For the first time 
in world history we are sending out three 
simultaneous expeditions to different stellar 
systems and for the first time we are trying 
to reach worlds that are seventy light years 
away!" 

The President closed the meeting request-
ing only the members of the Council to re-
main. A demand for all requirements had to 
be drawn up for the Economic Council and a 
request had to be made to the Academy of 
Stochastics and Prognostication to investi-
gate all possible hazards on the way to Acher-
nar. 

Weary Chara plodded along behind Evda 
wondering how it was that the famous psy-
chiatrist's pale cheeks were as fresh as ever. 

The girl wanted to be alone as quickly as pos-
sible so that she could quietly enjoy the exo-
neration of Mven Mass. It had been a red-let-
ter day! It is true the African had not been 
crowned as a hero in the way Chara had 
secretly hoped; he had been removed from 
the list of leaders for a long time, if not for 
ever. But he had been allowed to remain in 
society! Was not the wide and tortuous road 
of love, research and labour open to them 
both? 

Evda Nahl forced the girl to go to the 
nearest dining-room. Chara stared at the menu 
so long that Evda decided to take action, and 
called the numbers of the dishes and the 
index of their table into the speaking tube. 
They sat down at a little oval table for two in 
the centre of 
which 
a trapdoor 
opened 
almost immediately and a container 
with 
their 
order 
appeared. 
Evda Nahl 
offered 
Chara a glass containing the opalescent in-
vigorating drink Lio but was herself satis-
fied with a glass of cold water and a baked 
pudding of chestnuts, walnuts and bananas 
served with whipped cream. Chara ate a dish 
made from the minced meat of the rapt, 
a bird that has replaced both the domestic 
fowl and game birds in the modern cuisine. 
After Chara had eaten, Evda let her go and 
watched her as she ran down the staircase, 
with a grace that was astonishing even in the 
Great Circle Era, passing between statues 
of black metal and lanterns on posts of the 
most whimsical shapes. 

Chapter Thirteen 

A N G E L S OF H E A V E N 

Erg Noor held his breath as he followed the 
manipulations 
of 
the 
skilled 
laboratory 
workers. The mass of instruments reminded 
him of a spaceship's control tower, but the 
huge area of the room with its big, bluish win-
dows, immediately took his mind off the Cos-
mic ship. 

On a metal table in the middle of the room 
stood a special chamber made of thick sheets 
of rutholucite, a material that is transparent 
to visible and to infra-red rays. A network 
of pipes and wires encircled the brown enamel 
water-tank from the spaceship in which the 
two black jelly-fish from the planet of the 
iron star were still imprisoned. 

Eon Thai, erect as though doing gymnastics 
but with his arm still helplessly hanging in a 

sling, looked from a distance at the slowly 
revolving drum of a recording instrument. 
Above the biologist's black brows there ap-
peared beads of perspiration. 

Erg Noor licked his dry lips. 
"Nothing there. There can't be anything 
left but dust after five years' journey," said 
the astronaut hoarsely. 

" I f so, that's bad luck for Nisa and me," 
answered the biologist, "we shall probably 
have to fumble for years to find out the 
nature of our injuries." 

"Do you still think that the medusae and 
the crosses have the same organs for killing 
victims?" 

" I do. Grimm Schar and all the others have 
come to the same conclusion. Before that I 
had the most unexpected ideas. I imagined 
that the black cross had nothing at all to do 
with the planet..." 

" I thought so, too; if you remember, I 
spoke about it. I got the idea that it was a 
being from the disc-shaped spaceship and was 
on guard over it. If you think about it serious-
ly there's no reason to guard an invincible 
fortress from the outside, is there? When we 
tried to open the disc we had proof of the 
foolishness of such ideas." 

"My idea was that the cross wasn't alive 
but was just a robot placed there to guard 
the spaceship." 

"That's what I thought. But now, of course, 
I've given up all such ideas. The black cross is 
a living being engendered by the world of 
darkness. The beasts probably live down be-

low, on the plain. This one came from the 
direction of the gap in the cliffs. The medusae 
are lighter and more mobile, they live on the 
plateau where we landed. The connection 
between the black cross and the spiral disc is a 
pure coincidence due to the fact that our 
protective arrangements did not reach the 
far corner of the plain and it was all the 
time in the shadow behind the disc." 

"And do you think the lethal organs of 
the cross and the medusae are identical?" 

"Yes. Animals living in similar conditions 
should evolve similar organs. The iron star 
is a sun that radiates heat and electricity. 
The whole atmosphere of the planet is strong-
ly saturated with electricity. Grimm Schar 
believes that the animals gathered energy 
from the atmosphere and created condensa-
tions like our fireballs. Do you remember how 
the brown lights moved along the tentacles 
of the medusae?" 

"The cross had tentacles, too, but there 
was no..." 

"Simply because nobody had time to take 
note of them. The nature of the injury to 
the nerve column accompanied by paralysis 
of the higher centre concerned—we all agree 
on this—is the same in my case and Nisa's. 
That is the chief proof and the main hope!" 

"Hope?" Erg Noor showed signs of agita-
tion. 

"Of course. Look at this," said the biolog-
ist showing him the regular line of the record-
ing 
instrument. 
"The 
sensitive 
electrodes 
placed in the trap with the jelly-fish do not 

show anything. 
The monsters had a full 
charge of energy when they went in there 
and it could not have escaped from the tank 
after it was sealed. I do not think that the 
insulation 
of the Cosmic food containers 
could be broken down, it's much stronger 
than our light biological spacesuits. If you 
remember, the cross that injured Nisa did 
not do you any harm. Its supersonic waves 
penetrated into the superprotective spacesuit 
you wore and broke down your will-power 
but the paralyzing charges were powerless to 
inflict harm. They penetrated Nisa's light 
spacesuit in the same way as the jelly-fish's 
penetrated mine." 

"You mean that the charges of ball light-
ning or whatever it is that went into the tank 
should still be there, is that it? But the instru-
ments don't record anything." 

"That's why I say there is hope: it means 
that the jelly-fish have not been reduced to 
dust. They..." 

"Now 
I understand. 
They 
have sealed 
themselves up in something like a cocoon!" 

"That's it. Such forms of adaptation are 
widespread among living organisms that have 
to go through long periods of unfavourable 
climatic conditions—like the long, icy nights 
of the black planet and the hurricanes at 
'sunrise' and 'sunsef. As these conditions on the 
planet alternate very quickly I imagine the jelly-
fish can come out of their state of lethargy as 
quickly as they go into it. If our assumptions 
are correct it will be fairly easy to restore the 
lethal propensities of the black medusae." 

"By providing the temperature, atmospher-
ic, lighting and other conditions of the black 
planet, I suppose?" 

"Yes, we've made all the calculations and 
preparations. Soon Grimm Schar will be here 
and we'll start filling the tank with a mixture 
of neon, oxygen and nitrogen until the pres-
sure reaches three atmospheres. But first let's 
make sure of our ground." 

Eon Thai conferred with his two assistants. 
Some sort of a machine began crawling slowly 
towards the brown tank. The sheet of rutho-
lucite that formed the front of the protec-
tive housing moved to one side opening up a 
passage for the machine. 

The 
electrodes 
inside 
the 
tank 
were 
changed for micromirrors with 
cylindrical 
lamps to provide light for them. One of 
the assistants stood at the remote control 
panel: a concave surface appeared on the 
screen; it was covered with a sort of granular 
coating that reflected light very dully—this 
was the interior wall of the tank. 

"X-rays won't be of much use," said Eon 
Thai, "the insulation is too thick. We'll have 
to use a more complicated method." 

The revolutions of the mirror revealed, on 
the bottom of the tank, two white masses of 
irregular spherical shape and with a spongy, 
fibrous surface. The balls bore some resem-
blance to the fruit of the bread-tree that had 
shortly before been developed and were about 
70 centimetres in diameter. 

"Switch the televisophone on to Grimm 
Schar's vector," said the biologist to an assis-

tant. The scientist, as soon as he was sure of 
the correctness of the general assumptions, 
hurried to the laboratory. He screwed up his 
eyes near-sightedly, but merely from habit 
and not from weak sight, and looked over 
the apparatus. Grimm Schar did not have 
the 
impressive appearance and imperative 
character one would expect in a prominent 
scientist. Erg Noor remembered Renn Bose, 
whose bashful, boyish appearance was also 
deceptive and belied the greatness of his 
mind. 

"Open the welded seam," ordered Grimm 
Schar. A mechanical hand cut through the 
hard enamel mass without moving the heavy 
lid. Hoses with the gaseous mixture were 
attached to the stop-cocks. A strong infra-
red ray projector took the place of the iron 
star. 

"Temperature 
... 
pressure 
... 
electrical 
charge..." called out an assistant reading off 
the dials of the instruments. 

Half an hour later Grimm Schar turned to 
the astronauts. 

"Let's go to the rest-room, there's no way 
of guessing how long those capsuled beasts 
will take to revive. If Eon's right it won't be 
long. The assistants will call us." 

The 
Institute 
of 
Nerve 
Currents 
was 
situated far from the inhabited zone, on the 
fringe of the steppe reservation. At the end of 
summer the earth was dry and the wind had a 
peculiar rustle to it that came through the 
open windows together with a faint odour of 
sun-dried grasses. 

The three scientists, seated in comfortable 
armchairs, kept silent as they stared out of 
the windows over the tops of wide-spreading 
trees towards the haze of the distant horizon. 
From time to time one or the other of them 
would close his tired eyes but the waiting was 
too tense for anybody to doze. This time, 
however, the patience of the scientists was 
not too severely tried. Before three hours 
had passed the screen giving direct communi-
cation with the laboratory lit up and the 
assistant appeared, scarcely able to contain 
himself. 

"The lid's moving!" 
In an instant all three of them were in the 
laboratory. 

"Shut 
the 
rutholucite 
chamber 
tight, 
check up on its hermetic sealing!" ordered 
Grimm Schar. "Arrange planet conditions in 
the chamber." 

The powerful pumps hissed faintly, the 
pressure regulators whistled and in a moment 
the transparent cage was filled with the at-
mosphere of the world of darkness. 

"Increase gravitation, 
humidity 
and at-
mospheric 
electricity," 
continued 
Grimm 
Schar. The laboratory was filled with the 
acrid odour of ozone. 

Nothing happened. The scientist knitted 
his brows as he studied the instruments and 
tried to imagine what had been omitted. 

"They need darkness!" came Erg Noor's 
measured tones. 

Eon Thai even jumped in the air. 
"How 
could 
I have forgotten? 
Grimm 

Schar, you haven't been on the black planet, 
but I have!" 

"The 
polarizing shutters!" 
ordered 
the 
scientist instead of answering him. 

The light went out. The laboratory was 
illuminated only by the lights in the instru-
ments. The assistants pulled blinds over the 
control desk and complete darkness ensued. 
Here and there faint stars twinkled—the lu-
minous dials of some indicators. 

The breath of the black planet wafted in 
the faces of the astronauts bringing with it 
memories of the awful but thrilling days of 
hard struggle. 

There was silence for some minutes that 
was broken only by the cautious movements 
of Eon Thai who was tuning in the demonstra-
tion screen for infra-red reception and arrang-
ing the polarizing shield so that light from the 
screen would not be reflected. 

First came a faint sound and then a heavy 
thud as the lid from the tank fell down inside 
the chamber. It was followed by the familiar 
flickering of brown lights as the tentacles 
of the black monster appeared over the edge 
of the tank. With a sudden jump it leaped up-
wards spreading darkness over the whole 
area of the rutholucite chamber and banged 
against the transparent ceiling. Thousands of 
brown stars spread over the body of the jelly-
fish, its black cloak bulged and formed a 
dome as if the wind were blowing from below 
and then rested on the floor of the chamber 
with all its tentacles gathered in a bunch. The 
second monster rose out of the tank like 

another black phantom, its swift and silent 
movement inspiring fear in the onlookers. 
Here, however, within the walls of the experi-
mental chamber and surrounded by remote-
controlled instruments, the spawn of the pla-
net of darkness was powerless. 

Instruments measured, photographed, drew 
intricate curves, determined the nature of the 
animals and broke down their structure into 
various 
physical, 
chemical 
and 
biological 
indicants. The human intellect gathered these 
qualitatively 
different 
data together again 
and mastered the structure of the awe-inspir-
ing monsters in order to subordinate them to 
himself. 

As hour after hour passed almost unnoticed 
Erg Noor became sure of victory. 

Eon Thai was becoming more and more 
radiant, Grimm Schar grew as vivacious as 
his youthful assistants. 

At last the scientist approached Erg Noor. 
"You may go now with an easy heart. 
We shall stay here until the investigation is 
finished. I'm afraid to switch on visible light 
as these black medusae can't hide from it 
here as they would on their own planet. 
They must first be made to tell us all we want 
to know." 

"And how long will it take to find out?" 
"In three or four days our investigation 
will have become exhaustive for the level of 
knowledge we possess. We can already ima-
gine how their paralyzing organs function." 

"And will you be able to cure ... Nisa ... 
Eon?" 

"Yes!" 
Only then did Erg Noor realize what a 
heavy burden he had been bearing since that 
black day. Day or night... what did it matter! 
Wild joy filled the whole of that man of 
great restraint. He had difficulty in overcom-
ing a mad desire to throw Grimm Schar 
up into the air, to shake the little scientist 
and embrace him. Erg Noor was astounded at 
himself, began to calm down and a minute 
later had returned to his normal state of 
concentration. 

"Your studies will be a tremendous help 
to the future expedition that will have to 
fight against the black jelly-fish and crosses!" 

"Of course! We shall know the enemy 
now. But is there going to be another expedi-
tion to that world of heavy weight and dark-
ness?" 

" I don't doubt it." 

The warm morning of a northern autumn 
was just beginning. 

Erg Noor, without his usual hustle, was 
walking barefoot on the soft grass. In front 
of him, at the forest fringe, the green wall 
of the cedars was interspersed with already 
leafless maples that looked like columns of 
thin smoke. In the reservation man did not 
interfere with nature—there was beauty in the 
disorderly growths of tall grasses, in their 
mixed, contradictory, pleasant and pungent 
odours. 

A cold stream barred his way and Erg 
Noor turned on to a foot-path. The ripples 

caused by the wind on the sunlit surface of 
the transparent water gave it the appearance 
of an undulating network of wavy golden 
lines thrown on the pebbles of the river-bed. 
Unnoticeable strands of moss and water-
weeds floated on the water casting shadows 
that ran like blue patches along the bottom. On 
the far bank big pale-blue harebells swayed in 
the wind. The aroma of damp meadows 
and red autumn leaves promised the joy of 
labour to man, for tucked away in a far cor-
ner of his heart everyone had hidden some-
thing of the experience of the first ploughman. 

A bright yellow oriole alighted on a branch 
and 
emitted 
its 
mocking 
self-confident 
whistle. 

The clear sky over the cedar forest was 
turned to silver by the far-spreading wing 
of a cirrus cloud. Erg Noor dived into the 
gloom of the forest with its odours of cedar 
needles and resin, came out on the other side, 
climbed a hill and wiped his bare head that 
the dew had wetted. The forest reservation 
that surrounded the Nerve Clinic was not a 
big one and Erg Noor soon came to a road. 
The stream had been diverted into a series 
of basins of milk-coloured glass, keeping them 
filled with water. Several men and women in 
bathing costumes ran round a bend in the 
road and raced on between rows of brightly 
coloured flowers. The autumn water could 
hardly have been warm but the runners, 
encouraging 
one 
another 
with 
laughter 
and jokes, sprang into the water and in a 
noisy crowd swam down the cascade from 

basin to basin. Erg Noor smiled in spite of 
himself. It was rest-time at some local factory 
or farm. 

Never before had our planet seemed so 
beautiful to him who had spent the greater 
part of his life in the close quarters of a space-
ship. He was filled with profound gratitude 
to all people, to Earth's nature, to everything 
that had helped to save Nisa, his astronavi-
gator with the auburn curls. Today she had 
come to meet him in the clinic gardens. 
After a consultation with the doctors they 
had arranged to go away together to a polar 
sanatorium for nervous disorders. As soon as 
the scientists had managed to break the chain 
of paralysis and put an end to the persistent 
inhibition of the cerebral cortex caused by 
the discharge of the black cross-beast's charge 
through its tentacles, Nisa had become quite 
healthy. She had only to regain her former 
energy after such a long cataleptic sleep. Nisa 
was alive and well! It seemed to Erg Noor 
that he would never be able to think of that 
without an impulse of joy somewhere inside 
him. 

He saw the solitary figure of a woman com-
ing rapidly towards him from a side path. 
He would have recognized her among thous-
ands—Veda Kong, the Veda who had been 
so much in his thoughts before it had become 
clear that their paths in life were different. 
Erg Noor was accustomed to the diagrams of 
the computing machines and his thinking 
followed the same lines—he saw a steep arc 
sweeping 
upwards 
into 
the 
heavens—his 

own urge—while Veda's path of life and work 
left her hovering over the planet to delve into 
the depths of centuries passed and gone. 
The lines diverged until they were far apart. 

Erg Noor knew every tiny detail of Veda's 
face but he was suddenly surprised to notice 
the 
resemblance she bore to Nisa Creet. 
The same narrow face with eyes placed wide 
apart, the same high forehead with the long 
upward sweep of the eyebrows, the same 
expression of gentle irony in her big mouth. 
Even their noses were both slightly snub, 
softly rounded and a bit long, just as though 
they were sisters. The only difference was 
that Veda always had a direct and pensive 
look while 
Nisa Creet would 
throw her 
head back in youthful exuberance or would 
lower her forehead and knitted brows to meet 
an obstacle. 

"Are you examining me?" asked Veda, 
surprised. 

She held out both hands to Erg Noor who 
took them and pressed them to his cheeks. 
Veda shivered and pulled herself away. The 
astronaut gave a weak smile. 

" I wanted to thank those hands for having 
nursed Nisa. She ... I know about everything! 
Somebody had to be in constant attendance 
and you gave up an interesting expedition. 
Two months..." 

" I didn't give it up, I was late for it, wait-
ing for Tantra. The expedition had left by 
then, and well... she's charming, your Nisa! 
We look alike but she's the real companion 
for the conqueror of the Cosmos and the iron 

stars, with her urge to get back into space 
and her loyalty." 

"Veda!" 
"I'm not joking, Erg, I meant it. Don't you 
feel that this is no time for jokes? We must 
make everything clear!" 

" I find everything clear enough as it is! 
And I'm thanking you for Nisa, not for my-
self." 

"Don't thank me. It would have been 
difficult for me if you'd lost Nisa, that's 
why..." 

" I understand but still I don't believe you 
because I know that Veda Kong could never 
be so calculating. And so my gratitude re-
mains." 

Erg Noor patted the young woman's shoul-
der and placed his fingers in the crook of her 
arm. They walked side by side along the de-
serted road in silence until Erg Noor spoke 
again. 

"Who is he, the real one?" 
"Darr Veter." 
"The former Director of the Outer Sta-
tions? So that's it!" 

"Erg, you are saying words that mean 
nothing. I don't recognize you." 

" I suppose I must have changed. I can't 
imagine Darr Veter apart from his work and I 
thought that he was a Cosmic dreamer." 

"He is. He dreams of the world of stars but 
he has proved able to combine the stars with 
an ancient farmer's love of Earth. He is a man 
of knowledge with the big hands of the simple 
mechanic." 

Erg 
Noor 
involuntarily 
looked 
at 
his 
narrow hands with the long fingers of a mathe-
matician and musician. 

" I f you only knew, Veda, how much I 
love our Earth at this moment!" 

"After the world of darkness and a long 
journey 
with 
paralyzed 
Nisa? Of course, 
you do!" 

"You don't believe that love for 
Earth 
can provide the basis of my life?" 

" I don't. You're a real hero and will al-
ways be thirsting for further exploits. You 
will carry that love like a full bowl from 
which you are afraid to spill a drop, carry it 
on Earth in order to give it to the Cosmos for 
the sake of that same Earth!" 

"Veda, you'd have been burnt at the stake 
in the Dark Ages!" 

"I've been told that before. Here's the 
fork... Where are your shoes. Erg?" 

" I left them in the garden when I came to 
meet you. I'll have to go back." 

"Well, 
good-bye, 
Erg. 
My 
job 
here's 
finished and yours is just about to begin. 
Where shall we meet again? Perhaps it will be 
only before you leave on the new ship?" 

"Oh, no, Veda. Nisa and I are going to a 
polar sanatorium for three months. Come and 
see us and bring Darr Veter with 
you." 

"Which sanatorium? 
The 'Stone 
Heart' 
on the north coast of Siberia or 'Autumn 
Leaves' in Iceland?" 

"It's 
too 
late for 
the 
northern 
polar 
regions. We're being sent to the southern 
hemisphere where the summer will soon 

begin. The 'White Dawn' in Grahamland." 

"All right, Erg, we'll come if Darr Veter 
does not start out immediately to rebuild 
Satellite 
57. There'll probably be a long 
time spent on getting materials together." 

"That's a fine terrestrial man for you— 
almost a year in the sky!" 

"Don't try to be smart. That's quite near 
compared with your tremendous spaces, the 
spaces that divided us." 

"Do you regret it, Veda?" 
"Why do you ask, Erg? There are two 
halves in each of us, one half is anxious to 
get at the new, the other half cherishes the 
old and would be glad to return to it. You 
know that and you also know that return 
never achieves its aim." 

"But regret remains like a wreath on a 
beloved grave. Give me a kiss, Veda, my 
dear!" 

The young woman obediently complied 
with the request, pushed the astronaut light-
ly aside and strode swiftly away to the main 
road where there was an electrobus service. 
Erg Noor watched her until the robot driver 
of the first bus to arrive stopped the vehicle 
and her red dress disappeared inside. 

Veda also looked through the glass at 
Erg Noor as he stood there immobile. Her 
head was filled with the refrain of a song 
dating back to the Era of Disunity that had 
recently 
been 
reset 
to 
music 
by 
Arck 
Geer. Darr Veter had once repeated it to 
her in response to a gentle reproach from 
her. 

And neither 
the angels 

in heaven 
above. 

Nor the demons 
down 

under 
the sea, 

Can ever dissever my soul 
from 
the soul 

Of the beautiful 
Annabel 

Lee! 

This was the challenge of a man of ancient 
days to the menacing forces of nature that 
had taken his beloved from him ... the chal-
lenge of a man who was not reconciled to his 
loss 
and 
did 
not 
want 
to 
make 
any 
concessions to fate. 

The electrobus drew near the branch of 
the Spiral Way but Veda Kong was still stand-
ing by the window holding on to the polished 
hand-rails 
and 
humming 
the 
beautiful 
romance 
filled 
with 
such 
sweet 
sorrow. 

"Angels—that's what religious Europeans 
in the old days called the imaginary spirits 
of heaven, the heralds who made known the 
will 
of the gods. Angelos 
meant 
'herald' 
or 'messenger' in the ancient Greek language. 
It's a word that has been forgotten for centu-
ries..." Veda shook off these thoughts while 
she was at the station but they returned to 
her in the coach of the Spiral Way train. 

"The Heralds of Heaven, of the Cosmos-
why, that's what we might call Erg Noor and 
Mven Mass and Darr Veter. Especially Darr 
Veter when he will be in the nearby, terrestrial 
heaven, building a satellite..." Veda smiled 
mischievously. 
"Then 
the 
demons 
down 

under the sea that's us, the historians," she 
said aloud, listening to the sound of her own 
voice, 
and 
laughed merrily. 
"Yes, 
that's 
right, the angels of heaven and the spirits 
of the underworld! Only Darr Veter may not 
like it." 

Low cedars with black needles, a variety 
impervious to frosts that had been developed 
for the subantarctic regions, sang solemnly 
and monotonously in the never-slackening 
wind. The cold, dense air flowed like a swift 
river, carrying that extraordinary purity and 
freshness with it that one associates with the 
open ocean and high mountain ranges. When 
the wind comes in contact with the eternal 
snows of the mountains, however, it is dry, 
it tends to burn, like sparkling wine. Here 
the breath of the ocean made its heavy touch 
felt as the wind wrapped the body in a humid 
mantle. 

The building of the "White Dawn" sanato-
rium stretched down to the sea in terraces, 
the rounded form of its glass walls resembling 
the huge ocean liners of ancient days. The 
pale vermilion tones of the walls, staircases 
and vertical columns were in sharp contrast to 
the domed masses of the chocolate and violet 
andesite cliffs, cut by blue and grey porcelain-
like paths of cast syenite. The polar night in 
late spring, however, made all colours alike 
in its specially white light that seemed to 
come from the depths of the sky and the sea. 
The sun had hidden for an hour behind the 
plateau to the south. A majestic arc of light 

covered the southern half of the sky, reflect-
ed from the giant icecap of the southern 
continent that still remained on the high 
plateau of the eastern part to where it had 
been moved back by the will of man who 
had reduced it to one-quarter of its former 
mass. The icy white dawn, whose name the 
sanatorium bore, turned the whole country-
side into a phantom world of light without 
shadows or reflections. 

Four people were coming down the silvery 
porcelain path to the ocean. The faces of the 
two men who walked behind seemed carved 
out of grey granite and the big eyes of the 
two women were bottomless and mysterious. 

Nisa Creet, pressing her face against the 
fur collar of Veda Kong's jacket, was arguing 
with the historian. Veda, making no effort 
to conceal her faint amazement was looking 
into 
that 
gentle 
face 
that 
outwardly 
resembled hers. 

" I believe that the best gift a woman can 
make to the man she loves is to re-create him 
and in this way prolong the existence of her 
hero. Then another loving woman will create 
a new copy—why, it's almost like immortali-
t y ! " 

"Men feel differently about us," answered 
Veda. "Darr Veter once told me that he 
would not like to have a daughter that was 
too much like the woman he loved because 
it would be hard to go out of the world and 
leave her behind without him, without the 
cloak of his love and tenderness, leave her 
to a fate of which he would know nothing. 

That's just a relic of the jealousy and protec-
tion of the old days." 

" I cannot bear the thought of parting with 
a tiny being that is mine to his last drop of 
blood," 
continued Nisa, full of her own 
thoughts, "of giving him up to the school as 
soon as I have finished nursing him." 

" I can understand you although I do not 
agree," said Veda, frowning, as though the 
girl had touched a painful string in her heart. 
"One of mankind's most difficult tasks is 
victory over the blind instinct of maternity, 
the realization that only the collective up-
bringing of children by people trained and 
selected for the job can produce a man of 
our society. That insane maternal love of the 
past has almost died out. Every mother knows 
that the whole world is kind to her child and 
that he runs none of the dangers he formerly 
did. And so the instinctive love of the she-
wolf that arose out of fear for her progeny 
has disappeared." 

" I understand all that but only with my 
mind," said Nisa. 

" I not only know it but feel it, I know that 
the greatest happiness is to bring joy to anoth-
er and that is now possible for anybody, 
irrespective of age. That which was possible 
in former ages for parents and grandparents, 
and most of all for mothers... Why must 
one always be together with the little one? 
That's also a relic of ancient days, when 
the woman was compelled to live a narrow 
life and could not always be together with the 
man she loved. You'll always be together, as 

long as you love each other..." 

"I 
don't 
know, 
but sometimes 
I feel 
an overpowering desire to have beside me 
a little one that is like him, it is so strong 
that I clench my hands ... no, I don't know 
anything." 

"There's Java, the Mothers' Island. Those 
who want to bring up their own children live 
there, those who've lost their dear ones, for 
example..." 

"Oh no! 
And 
I couldn't be a teacher, 
either, like those who have some special love 
for children. I feel that I have great strength 
and I've been into the Cosmos once alrea-
dy." 

"You're 
the 
personification 
of 
youth, 
Nisa, and not only physically. Like all people 
who are very young you don't realize when 
you come up against contradictions that they 
are what go to make up life. You don't realize 
that the joy of love will most certainly bring 
anxiety, cares and sorrows that will be the 
greater, the stronger the love. And you think 
that you'll lose everything at the first blow 
struck by life." 

As she uttered those last words Veda her-
self became aware that Nisa's restiveness 
and anxiety were not to be explained by 
youthfulness alone. 

Veda had made a mistake common to 
many people, that of believing that spiritual 
traumas heal together with physical wounds. 
That, however, is not the case, for wounds to 
the psyche remain for a long, long time, 
hidden deep down in a physically healthy 

body, and they may open up at any moment 
from the most insignificant of causes. Such 
was Nisa's case—she had been paralyzed for 
five years and it had left its impress in every 
cell of her body; even if the memory was 
subconscious it still remained—the horror of 
her meeting with the terrible cross that had 
almost been the death of Erg Noor! 

Nisa 
guessed what 
Veda was 
thinking 
about and answered her in a dull voice. 

"Ever since the iron star there is a strange 
feeling that has never left me. Somewhere 
there is an empty place in my heart. It con-
tinues to exist together with confident joy 
and strength and does not exclude them and 
at the same time does not disappear. I can 
struggle against it only by means of something 
that will employ me entirely and will not 
leave me alone... Oh, now I know what the 
Cosmos is for a lonely man and have even 
greater respect for the first space travel-
lers!" 

" I 
think I can understand," said Veda. 
" I was once on the tiny Polynesian Islands 
that are lost in the ocean. There, standing 
by the sea in a moment of loneliness, you are 
overcome by a profound sorrow that is like 
a nostalgic song merging with the deadly 
monony of great distances. Perhaps that is 
a memory of the distant past, a memory of 
the primordial isolation of his consciousness 
telling man how weak and helpless he former-
ly was, shut up in his own little cage of a 
soul. The only cure was common work and 
common 
thoughts—a 
ship 
came, smaller. 

even, than the island, but it was enough to 
change the ocean. A handful of companions 
and a ship is a world of its own striving to-
wards distant objectives that they can reach 
and subordinate to their will. The same is 
true of the Cosmic vessel, the spaceship. 
In that ship you are together with strong and 
brave companions! But alone in the Cosmos," 
Veda shuddered, " I don't suppose a man 
could stand it!" 

Nisa clung still more closely to 
Veda. 

"How well you said that, Veda! That's 
why I want everything at once..." 

"Nisa, I'm getting very fond of you. Now 
I can sense the meaning of your decision but 
at first I thought it was sheer madness. For 
a ship to be able to return from such a long 
flight your children will have to take your 
places on the return journey—two Ergs, or 
maybe, more." 

Nisa squeezed Veda's hand and pressed her 
nose against her cheek, cold from the wind. 

"Do you think you can stand it, Nisa? 
It's impossibly difficult!" 

"What difficulties are you talking about, 
Veda?" asked Erg Noor, turning round on 
hearing her last exclamation. "Have you come 
to an agreement with Darr Veter? For the 
last half-hour he's been trying to persuade me 
to 
give 
the 
youth 
the 
benefit 
of 
my 
experience as an astronaut and not to set 
out on a flight from which I shall never 
return." 

"Has he persuaded you?" 
"No. My experience as an astronaut is still 

1-IO1I6 

more necessary to pilot Lebed to her desti-
nation, up there," said Erg pointing to the 
bright starless sky, to the place where Acher-
nar should be seen, lower than the Lesser 
Magellanic Cloud and just below Tucanae 
and the Hydra, "to pilot her where no ship 
from Earth has ever been before!" 

As Erg Noor spoke those last words the 
edge of the rising sun came in a burst of fire 
over the horizon, its rays driving away all 
the mystery of the white dawn. 

The four friends walked down to the water. 
A 
cold breeze came towards them from 
the ocean and the heavy swell of the stormy 
Antarctic seas came in mighty surfless rollers 
that raced up the beach. Veda Kong looked 
at the steel-grey water with interest, it grew 
rapidly darker in the depths and in the rays 
of the low sun took on the violet hue of the 
ice. 

Nisa Creet was standing beside her in a blue 
fur coat and round cap from which her dark 
auburn curls escaped in profusion. The girl 
held her head up in her usual pose. Darr 
Veter could not help but admire her but 
frowned as he did so. 

"Veter, don't you like Nisa?" exclaimed 
Veda with exaggerated indignation. 

"You 
know 
I'm 
very 
fond 
of 
her," 
answered Darr Veter moodily, "but at the 
moment she seems to me so small and fragile 
in comparison with..." 

"With what awaits me?" asked Nisa with a 
note of challenge in her voice. "Are you 
transferring the attack from Erg to me now?" 

"I 
wasn't thinking of anything of 
the 
sort," answered Darr Veter, seriously and sad-
ly, "but my grief is natural. A beautiful crea-
ture of my wonderful Earth must disappear 
into 
Cosmic void, into the darkness and 
frightful cold. It's not pity that I feel, Nisa, 
but grief over a loss!" 

"You feel the same about it as I do," 
agreed Veda. "Nisa, a bright spark of life... 
and dead, icy space." 

"You think I'm a delicate flower?" asked 
Nisa and there was a strange intonation to the 
question that made Veda hesitate to agree 
that that was what she did think. 

"Who, more than I, enjoys the struggle 
against the cold?" and the girl took off her 
cap and her fur coat and shook out her au-
burn curls. 

"What are you doing?" asked Veda, the 
first to guess her intention. She ran to get 
hold of the girl. 

But Nisa ran to the edge of the cliff and 
threw her clothes to Veda. 

The cold waves closed over Nisa and Veda 
shivered as she tried to imagine the sensation 
of such a bath. Nisa calmly swam out to sea 
cutting through the waves with strong strokes. 
As she rose on a crest she waved to those on 
shore, inviting them to join her in the water. 

Veda Kong watched with growing admira-
tion. 

"Veter, Nisa would be a better mate for a 
polar bear than for Erg. Now can you, a man 
of the north, admit yourself beaten?" 

" I am a northerner by ancestry but still I 

prefer the warm southern seas," admitted 
Darr Veter plaintively as he walked unwilling-
ly towards the edge of the sea. He took off 
his clothes and touched the water with his toe 
and then, ouch! he plunged into an approach-
ing steel-grey wave. With 
three 
powerful 
strokes he reached the crest of a wave and 
dived into the trough of another. Darr Veter's 
reputation was saved by his many years of 
training and his habit of bathing all the year 
round. His breath was checked and there were 
red rings before his eyes. A few brisk dives 
and leaps in the water returned to him the 
ability to breathe freely. He returned shivering 
and blue with the cold and ran up the hill 
together with Nisa. A few minutes later they 
were enjoying the warmth of their fur clothes. 
It seemed that even the icy wind brought 
with it a breath of the coral seas. 

"The more I get to know you, the more 
I'm convinced that 
Erg hasn't made any 
mistake in his choice," whispered Veda. "You, 
better than anybody else, will be able to 
encourage him in a moment of difficulty, 
to bring him joy and take care of him." 

Nisa's cheeks, devoid of any sunburn, were 
flushed a rosy red. 

At breakfast on a high crystal terrace that 
vibrated in the wind, Veda met the girl's 
gentle, pensive glance several times. All four 
ate in silence, unwilling to talk as people 
usually are on the eve of parting for a long 
time. 

"It's hard to have to part from such people 
when you have only just got to know them!" 

Darr Veter suddenly exclaimed. 

"Perhaps you..." began Erg Noor. 
"My free time is over. It's time for me to 
get up into the sky. Grom Orme's waiting 
for me!" 

"And rt's time for me to get down to 
work, too," added Veda. "I'm going down 
into the depths, into a recently discovered 
cave, a treasure repository of the Era of 
Disunity." 

"Lebed 
will be ready to take off in the 
middle of next year and we're going to start 
preparations in six weeks from now," said 
Erg Noor, softly. "Who's directing the Outer 
Stations at the moment?" 

"So far Junius Antus has been, but he 
doesn't want to give up his job with the me-
mory machines and the Council has not yet 
confirmed the candidacy of Embe Ong, an 
engineer and physicist from the Labrador F 
station." 

" I don't know him." 
"Few people do, he's working for the 
Academy of the Bounds of Knowledge on 
questions of megawave mechanics." 

"What may that be?" 
"The powerful rhythms of the Cosmos, 
huge waves that spread slowly through space. 
The contradiction 
between colliding 
light 
velocities producing negative values greater 
than the absolute unit, for example, finds 
expression in the megawave. The problem 
has not yet been developed." 

"And what is Mven Mass doing?" 
"He's writing a book on emotions. He, too, 

has very little time left to himself, the Acade-
my of Stochastics and Prognostication has 
appointed 
him 
to 
a consultative job 
in 
connection with the flight of your Lebed. As 
soon as they have enough material for him 
he'll have to give up his book." 

"That's a pity, it's an important subject. 
It's time we had a proper understanding of 
the reality and strength of the world of emo-
tions," said Erg Noor. 

"I'm afraid Mven Mass is incapable of a 
cold analysis," said Veda. 

"That's as it should be, if he were he 
wouldn't write anything outstanding," object-
ed Darr Veter, as he rose to his feet to say 
good-bye. 

"Till our next meeting!" Erg and Nisa 
held out their hands to him. "Hurry up and 
finish that job of yours or we shan't meet 
again." 

"Yes, we shall," promised Darr Veter con-
fidently. "Even if it's only in the El Homra 
Desert before the take-off." 

"Before the take-off," repeated the astro-
nauts. 

"Come 
on, my angel of heaven," said 
Veda Kong as she took Darr Veter by the 
arm, pretending not to notice his knitted 
brows. 
"You're 
probably 
fed 
up 
with 
Earth?" 

Darr Veter stood with his feet wide apart 
on the still shaky structure that formed the 
skeleton of the hull and looked down into the 
fearful abyss between the clouds. Our planet 

was there and its tremendous size could still 
be felt at a distance of five times its own 
diameter; he could see the grey outlines of 
the continents and the violet of the seas. 

Darr Veter recognized outlines that had 
been familiar to him from childhood through 
pictures taken from satellites. There was the 
concave line with dark strips of mountains 
stretching across it. To the right the sea 
sparkled and directly under his feet was a 
narrow mountain valley. He was in luck that 
day—the clouds had parted directly over that 
part of the planet where Veda was living and 
working. At the foot of the vertical terraces 
of iron-coloured mountains there was an an-
cient cave that went deep into the earth in a 
number of extensive storeys. It was there 
that Veda was selecting from amongst the 
dumb and dusty fragments of past life those 
grains of historical truth without which the 
present could not be properly understood nor 
the future foreseen. 

Darr Veter, leaning over the rail of a plat-
form of corrugated zirconium bronze, sent a 
mental greeting to the spot, roughly conjec-
tured, that was fast disappearing under the 
wing of the cirrus clouds of intolerable bright-
ness coming up from the west. The darkness 
of night stood like a wall sprinkled with 
shining stars. Layers of clouds floated by like 
gigantic rafts hanging one over the other. 
Below them the Earth's surface was rolling 
into the darkening abyss as though it were 
disappearing forever into the absolute. A deli-
cate zodiacal light clothed the dark side of 

the planet shedding its glow into the dark-
ness of Cosmic space. 

There was a layer of light-blue clouds over 
the day-light side of Earth that reflected the 
powerful light of the grey-steel Sun. Anybody 
who looked at the clouds except through 
dark filters would be blinded as would any-
body, unprotected by the 800 kilometres of 
Earth's atmosphere, who turned his face to 
the Sun. The harsh short-wave rays—ultra-
violet and X-rays—were irradiated in a power-
ful stream that was lethal to all living things. 
A constant downpour of Cosmic particles 
was added to the stream. Newly-awakened 
stars or those that had collided at unimaginab-
ly great distances in the Galaxy sent deadly 
radiation out into space. Only the reliable 
protection 
of 
their 
spacesuits 
saved the 
workers from speedy death. 

Darr Veter threw the safety line over to 
the other side and moved towards the radiant 
dipper of Ursa Major. A giant pipe had been 
fixed in position throughout the entire length 
of the future satellite. At either end acute-
angled triangles rose up from it to support 
the discs radiating the magnetic field. When 
the 
batteries transforming the Sun's blue 
radiations into electricity were installed it 
would be possible to do away with lifelines 
and walk along the lines of force in the mag-
netic field with directional plates on the 
chest and back. 

"We want to work at night." The voice of 
a young engineer, Cadd Lite, suddenly sound-
ed in his space helmet. "Altai 
has promised 

to provide the light." 

Darr Veter looked to the left and below 
where a bunch of cargo rockets, tied together, 
lay like sleeping fish. Above them, under a 
flat roof to protect it from meteorites and the 
Sun, floated the temporary platform built 
from the inner plating of the satellite where 
all the components brought by the rockets 
were stored and assembled. Workers crawling 
there like black bees suddenly turned to 
glow-worms when the reflecting surfaces of 
their spacesuits moved beyond the shadow of 
the roof. A cobweb of ropes stretched from 
the gaping hatches in the sides of the rockets 
out of which big components were being un-
loaded. Higher still, directly over the hull of 
the satellite, a group of people in strange, 
often ridiculous, poses were busy round a 
huge machine. One ring of beryllium bronze 
with borason plating would have weighed at 
least a hundred tons on Earth. Here the huge 
mass was dangling beside the metal skeleton 
of the satellite on a thin wire rope whose 
only purpose was to keep all these components 
rotating round Earth at the same velocity. 

The workers became confident and agile 
once they had become accustomed to the 
absence of weight or rather, to the negligible 
weights. 
These 
skilled 
workers, 
however, 
would soon have to be replaced by others. 
Lengthy periods of physical labour without 
gravitation 
lead to 
disturbances in 
blood 
circulation which might become chronic and 
make the sufferer a permanent invalid on his 
return to Earth. For this reason the shift 

on the satellite was one hundred and fifty 
working hours after which the worker re-
turned to Earth, going through reacclimatiza-
tion at the Intermediate Station revolving 
round the Earth at a height of 900 kilometres. 

Darr Veter directed the assembly of the 
satellite and tried to avoid physical exertion 
although, at times, he badly wanted to help 
hasten the completion of some job or another. 
He would have to hold out at a height of 
57,000 kilometres for several months. 

If he agreed to night work he would have 
to send his young workers back to the planet 
and call others before time. Barion, the const-
ruction job's second planetship, was on the 
Arizona Plain where Grom Orme sat at the 
TVP 
screens 
and 
registration 
machine 
controls. 

A decision to work through the entire icy 
Cosmic night would have reduced the time 
required for assembling the satellite by one 
half and Darr Veter could not let such an 
opportunity pass. As soon as they had ob-
tained his consent the workers came down 
from 
the 
platform, 
running about in all 
directions, making a still more complicated 
network of ropes. The planetship Altai 
that 
served as living quarters for the satellite 
builders and hung motionless, moored to one 
end of the satellite's main beam, suddenly 
cast off the hawsers that linked her main hatch 
with the satellite. A long stream of blinding 
flame shot out of her exhausts. The huge ship 
swung round swiftly and silently, not the 
slightest noise carrying through the emptiness 

of interplanetary space. The skilled comman-
der of Altai needed no more than a few strokes 
of the engines to send the ship forty metres 
above the structure and turn with the landing 
lights directed at the assembly 
platform. 
Hawsers were again dropped between the 
ship and the satellite and the whole mass 
of objects suspended in space became motion-
less relative to each other as they continued 
their revolutions round the Earth at a speed 
of about ten thousand kilometres an hour. 

The distribution of the cloud masses told 
Darr Veter that the construction job was 
passing over the Antarctic region of the pla-
net and would, therefore, soon enter Earth's 
shadow. The improved heating system of the 
spacesuit could not fully guarantee its wearer 
against the bitter cold of Cosmic space and 
woe betide the careless traveller who exhaust-
ed his batteries. An architect-erector had been 
killed that way a month before when he hid 
from a meteorite shower in the cold shell 
of an open rocket. He did not live to reach 
the 
sunny 
side 
of 
the 
planet. 
Another 
engineer was killed by a meteorite—such oc-
currences could not be foreseen or prevented 
with any degree of certainty. The building 
of a satellite always claimed its victims and 
nobody knew who would be the next. The 
laws of stochastics, although only 
partly 
applicable to such tiny particles as individual 
people, said that 
he, 
Darr Veter, would 
most probably be the next because he would 
be there, at that height and open to all the 
vagaries of the Cosmos, longer than anybody 

else. There was an impudent little 
inner 
voice, however, that told Darr Veter that 
nothing could possibly happen to his magni-
ficent 
person. 
No 
matter 
how 
ridiculous 
such confidence may have been for a mathe-
matically minded man it never abandoned 
Darr Veter and helped him calmly balance 
himself on narrow girders and grilles on the 
open, unprotected hull of the satellite in the 
abyss of the black sky. 

Structures on Earth were erected by spe-
cial 
machines called embryotecti 
because 
they worked on the principle of the cyber-
netic development of the living organism. 
It goes without saying that the molecular 
structure of the living organism, effected by 
the hereditary cybernetic 
mechanism, was 
immeasurably more complicated. 

Living 
organisms, however, could 
only 
grow in the conditions provided by warm 
solutions of 
ionized 
molecules while the 
embryotecti 
usually 
worked 
in 
polarized 
streams of electricity or light or in a magne-
tic field. The markings and keys on all the 
component 
parts 
painted 
in 
radioactive 
thallium gave the correct orientation to the 
machines assembling them precisely and at 
high speed. The satellite was at such a great 
height that there could not have been any 
such machines. The assembly of the satellite 
was an old-fashioned construction job em-
ploying human hands. Despite the dangers 
involved the work seemed so interesting that 
it attracted thousands of 
volunteers. 
The 
psychophysiological 
stations were scarcely 

able to 
examine the flood of 
volunteers 
desirous of informing the Council of their 
readiness to venture into interplanetary space. 

Darr Veter reached the foundations of the 
solar machines that were arranged fanwise 
round a huge hub containing the artificial 
gravity apparatus and joined the battery he 
was carrying on his back to the terminals 
of the test circuit. A simple melody could be 
heard in the phones of his space helmet. 
Then he connected in parallel a glass plate 
with the thin gold lines of a drawing on it. 
It produced the same melody, Darr Veter 
turned a couple of vernier scales until points 
of time coincided and listened to make sure 
there was no difference in the melody or even 
in the tone of the tuning. An important part 
of the future satellite had been assembled 
faultlessly. They could now begin the erec-
tion of the radiation electric motors. Darr 
Veter straightened shoulders that were bent 
wearily under the weight of a spacesuit worn 
over a long period and turned his head to the 
right and to the left. The movement caused a 
creaking of the cervical vertebrae that immo-
bility in the space helmet had made stiff. 
It was a good thing that, so far, Darr Veter 
had proved impervious to the psychoses that 
affect those who work outside the terrestrial 
atmosphere—these included ultra-violet sleep-
ing sickness and infra-red 
madness—other-
wise he would not have been able to bring 
his worthy mission to a successful conclusion. 

Soon the outer walls of the hull would pro-
tect the workers from the effects of loneliness 

in Cosmos, alone over an abyss that had 
neither sky nor ground! 

Altai 
sent out a small rescue rocket that 
shot past the construction job like an arrow. 
This was a tug going to fetch the automatic 
rockets carrying only cargo and halting at 
a given altitude. Just in time! The bundle of 
rockets, people, machines and building mate-
rials, floating in space, was passing over to 
the night side of the planet. The tug rocket 
returned pulling behind it three long, gleam-
ing, blue fish-like rockets that weighed a 
hundred and fifty tons on Earth (without 
fuel). 

The rockets joined their fellows around 
the assembly platform. 
In one leap Darr 
Veter reached the other side of the hull and 
was soon amongst the technicians supervis-
ing the unloading who were gathered in a 
circle. They were discussing the plan for the 
night work. Darr Veter consented but insisted 
that all personal batteries be changed for 
freshly charged ones with sufficient energy to 
keep the spacesuits warm for thirty hours and 
at the same time supply the electric lamps, 
air filters and radiotelephones. 

The whole construction job was plunged in 
darkness as though it were at the bottom of 
the sea but the soft zodiacal light from the 
Sun's rays dispersed by the gases of the at-
mospheric zones still lit up the skeleton of the 
future satellite that was gripped in a frost of 
180°C. The superconductivity of the metal 
now hindered them even more than it did 
by day. The slightest amount of wear in the 

insulation of the instruments, batteries or 
accumulators surrounded the nearby objects 
with a blue glow from current flowing along 
their surfaces and which could not be cana-
lized in any given direction. 

The profound darkness of outer space came 
together with increasing cold. The stars burned 
fiercely like dazzlingly bright blue needles in 
the sky. The invisible and inaudible flight of 
the meteoroids was even more awe-inspiring at 
night. In the currents of the atmosphere over 
the dark globe down below there were va-
riously coloured clouds of 
electric 
glow, 
spark discharges of tremendous length and 
sheets of dispersed light thousands of kilo-
metres long. Down below, in the upper layers 
of the atmosphere there were gales of greater 
fury than anything known on Earth. Vigo-
rous movement of energy continued in an 
atmosphere saturated by the radiations of 
the Sun and the Cosmos and made communi-
cation with the planet extremely difficult. 

Suddenly something changed in that tiny 
world lost in the darkness and fearful cold. 
Darr Veter did not immediately realize that 
the planetship had switched on its search-
lights. The darkness had become even blacker, 
the burning stars grew dull, leaving the plat-
form and the hull in a sea of bright white 
light that divided them off from the gloom. 
A few minutes later Altai reduced the voltage 
and the light turned yellow and was less in-
tense. The planetship cut down on its energy 
consumption. The squares and ellipses that 
went to make up the walls of the hull, the 

latticed trusses that reinforced the structure, 
the cylinders and pipes of the reservoirs again 
moved about, finding their places in the skele-
ton of the satellite as though in daylight. 

Darr Veter felt for a crossbeam, took hold 
of the handles of a roller car running on a 
ropeway, and with one hard push of his feet 
sailed up to Altai. 
Right in front of the plan-
etship's hatch he pressed the brake lever in 
his hand and halted just in time to prevent 
his crashing into a closed door. 

The air-lock was not kept at normal ter-
restrial pressure in order not to lose too much 
air with the coming and going of such a large 
number of workers. Darr Veter kept on his 
spacesuit until he was in a second, auxiliary 
air-lock, where he unscrewed his space helmet 
and unfastened the batteries. 

Flexing a body that was weary of the 
spacesuit, Darr Veter walked firmly along the 
deck of the ship, enjoying a return to almost 
normal gravity. The artificial gravitation of 
the 
planetship worked constantly. 
It was 
inexpressibly 
pleasant 
to 
feel 
yourself 
standing firmly on the ground as a man 
should stand and not be like a flea flounder-
ing in a unsteady, treacherous gulf! Soft 
light and warm air and a comfortable chair 
tempted him to stretch out in it and relax 
without having to think. 
Darr Veter was 
experiencing the 
pleasures of 
his distant 
ancestors that had once astonished him in 
old novels. It was in this way that people en-
tered a warm house, a mud hut or a felt tent 
after long journeys through cold deserts, wet 

forests or icy mountains. And now as then a 
thin wall separated him from a huge, dange-
rous world, hostile to man, a wall that re-
tained the warmth and light, gave him a 
chance to rest, gather fresh strength and think 
over what he was to do next. 

Darr Veter did not yield to the temptation 
of armchair and book. He had to contact 
Earth—the light burning all night at that 
height might cause alarm amongst those who 
were 
keeping the satellite under observa-
tion. It was also necessary to warn Earth 
that reinforcements would be needed ahead 
of time. 

There was good communication that day 
and Darr Veter talked with Grom Orme on 
the TVP and not in coded signals; the TVP 
was an extremely powerful one, such as was 
fitted to every planetship. The old chairman 
was pleased with the progress made and said 
he would immediately see about new workers 
and extra materials. 

Darr Veter left the Altai's 
control tower 
and passed through the library that had been 
re-equipped as a dormitory with two tiers 
of bunks. Cabins, dining-rooms, the cook's 
galley, the side corridors and the forward 
engine-room had all been fitted out with 
extra bunks. The planetship had been convert-
ed into a stationary base and was overcrowd-
ed. Scarcely able to drag his feet Darr Veter 
walked down 
the corridor 
panelled with 
plastics warm to the touch, and lazily opened 
and closed hermetically sealed doors. 

He was thinking of astronauts who spent 

dozens of years inside such a ship without any 
hope of leaving it before the appointed time, 
a cruelly long one. He had been living there 
six months and every day had left the narrow 
confines to work in the vast oppressive spaces 
of interplanetary emptiness. He was already 
longing for his beautiful Earth with its steppes 
and seas and the teeming life of the big cent-
res in the inhabited zones. But Erg Noor, 
Nisa Creet and twenty other people would 
have to spend ninety-two dependent years 
or a hundred and forty terrestrial years in a 
spaceship before it brought them back to 
their own planet. Not one of them could 
possibly live so long! Their bodies would be 
cremated and buried away on the distant 
planets of the green zirconium star! 

Or they would die en route and their bo-
dies enclosed in a funeral rocket would be 
sent out into the Cosmos just as the funeral 
boats of their ancestors swept out to sea 
carrying dead warriors away with them. But 
such heroes as those who undertook life-
long imprisonment in a spaceship without the 
hope that they, personally, would return, 
were unknown in the history of mankind. 
No, he was wrong, Veda would have rebuked 
him! How could he have forgotten the name-
less fighters for the dignity and freedom of 
man in distant epochs who undertook even 
greater risks—horrible tortures and life-long 
imprisonment in damp dungeons. Yes, these 
heroes had been stronger and more worthy 
even than his contemporaries preparing to 
make their magnificent flight into the Cosmos 

to explore distant worlds! 

And he, Darr Veter, who had never been 
away from his native planet for any length 
of time, was a pygmy compared with them 
and by no means an angel of heaven, as his 
infinitely dear Veda Kong called him! 

Chapter Fourteen 

T H E STEEL D O O R 

The robot tunneller had been working for 
twenty days in the damp and gloom before it 
had finally cleared away the roof fall and 
bolstered up the ceiling. The road down into 
the cave was open and could be used as soon 
as it had been tested for safety. Other robots, 
small cars on caterpillar tracks, operated by 
Archimedean screws moved noiselessly down 
into the depths. At every hundred metres the 
instruments on the cars sent back reports 
on temperature, humidity and the content 
of the air. The cars cleverly overcame all 
obstacles and went down to a depth of four 
hundred metres. Following behind them Veda 
Kong and a group of historians descended 
into the treasure cave. Ninety years before 
that, when tests for subsoil waters were being 

made, indicators had shown a large quantity 
of metal amongst sandstone and limestone 
deposits that are not, in general, associated 
with metallic ores. It was soon discovered that 
the place coincided with a description of the 
site of a cave, Halovkul, that had been men-
tioned in old legends. The name had originally 
been Hall of Culture in a language now dead. 
During a terribly devastating war, people who 
had believed themselves the most advanced 
in science and culture, hid the treasures 
of their civilization in a cave. In those distant 
days secrecy and mystery were very wide-
spread. 

Veda was quite as excited as the youngest 
of her assistants as she slid down the wet, 
red clay that formed the floor of the sloping 
entrance tunnel. 

Her imagination drew pictures of magni-
ficent halls, hermetically sealed safes contain-
ing films, drawings and maps, show-cases 
in which tape-recordings or the recordings 
of memory machines, shelves with jars of 
chemical compounds, alloys and medicines, 
stuffed animals, now extinct, in air- and 
water-tight glass-cases, prepared plants and 
skeletons put together from the fossilized 
bones of the past inhabitants of Earth. She 
even dreamed of slabs of silicoll in which the 
pictures of the most famous artists had been 
cast, 
whole 
galleries 
of 
sculptures 
of 
mankind's 
best 
representatives, 
the 
most 
prominent people, skilful carvings of 
ani-
mals ... models of famous buildings, inscrip-
tions about outstanding events perpetuated 

in stone or metal... 

Lost in her dreams Veda Kong found her-
self in a huge cave between three and four 
thousand square metres in extent. The vault-
ed ceiling was lost in the darkness and long 
stalactites glistened in the electric light. The 
cave was truly magnificent and, in realization 
of Veda's dreams, machines and show-cases 
had been placed in the countless niches formed 
in the walls 
by 
the 
ribs and ledges of 
limestone. With shouts of joy the archaeolo-
gists spread around the perimeter of 
the 
cave; many of the machines standing in the 
niches, some of them retaining the polish 
on their glass and metal parts, were motor-
cars of the type that pleased our distant 
ancestors to such an extent and were consi-
dered the highest technical achievement of 
human genius in the Era of Disunity. In that 
period, for some unknown reason, people 
built large numbers of vehicles capable of 
carrying only a few passengers. The construc-
tion of the cars reached a high level of ele-
gance, the engines and steering mechanisms 
were very ingenious but in all else 
these 
vehicles were senseless. Hundreds of thousands 
of them filled the city streets and country roads 
carrying people who lived far from the places 
where they worked and hurried every day to 
reach their jobs and then get home again. 
The vehicles were dangerous to drive, killed 
a tremendous number of people every year 
and burned up millions and millions of tons 
of valuable organic substances accumulated 
in the geological past of the planet and in so 

doing poisoned the atmosphere with carbon 
monoxide. The archaeologists of the Great 
Circle Era were very disappointed when they 
discovered how much room had been devot-
ed to these machines in the cave. 

On low platforms, however, there were 
more powerful steam-engines, electric motors, 
jet, turbine and nuclear motors. 
In glass 
show-cases 
covered 
with 
a 
coating 
of 
limestone there were vertical rows of instru-
ments of all kinds, most likely they were 
TV receivers, cameras, calculating machines 
and other similar devices. This museum of 
machines, some of which had quite rusted 
away but others were in a good state of 
preservation, was of great historical value as 
it illustrated the technical level of civilization 
at a distant date, the majority of whose re-
cords had been lost in political and military 
disturbances. 

Miyiko 
Eigoro, Veda's faithful assistant 
who had again given up her beloved sea for 
the damp and darkness of underground explo-
ration, noticed the black opening of a galllery 
at the far end of the cave, behind a big lime-
stone pillar. The pillar turned out to be the 
limestone-covered 
skeleton 
of 
a 
machine 
and at its foot lay a heap of plastic dust, the 
remains of the door that had once covered 
the entrance to the gallery. Advancing step 
by step, guided by the red cables of the scout-
ing machines, the archaeologists got into the 
second chamber that was almost at the same 
level and was filled with hermetically sealed 
show-cases of metal and glass. A long English 

inscription in big letters ran round the verti-
cal walls that had, in places, collapsed. Veda 
had to stop for a moment to decipher it. 

With the boastfulness that was typical of 
the ancient individualists, the builders of the 
caves informed their descendants that they 
had reached the heights of knowledge and 
were preserving their magnificent achieve-
ments for posterity. 

Miyiko shrugged her shoulders contemp-
tuously. 

"The inscription alone tells us that the Hall 
of Culture belongs to the end of the Era of 
Disunity, to the last years of the old type of 
social order. This foolish confidence in the 
eternal and unchanging continuation of their 
civilization, language, customs, morals and in 
the majesty of the so-called 'white man' is 
typical of the periold!" 

"You have a clear conception of the past, 
but it is somewhat one-sided, Miyiko. Through 
the grim skeleton of moribund past I see 
those who struggled for a better 
future. 
Their future is our 'today'. I see countless 
men and women seeking light in a narrow 
impoverished life—they had strength enough 
to fight their way out of its captivity and 
goodness enough to help their friends and not 
harden their hearts in the suffocating morals 
of the world around them. And they were 
brave, recklessly brave." 

"But it was not they who hid their culture 
here," objected Miyiko. "Just look, there is 
nothing but machines, technology here. They 
wallowed in machines, paying no attention to 

their own moral and emotional degradation. 
They were contemptuous of the past and 
blind to the future!" 

Veda thought that Miyiko was right. The 
lives of the people who had filled those caves 
would have been easier if they had been 
able 
to 
compare 
that 
which 
they 
had 
achieved with that which still had to be 
done before the world and society could be 
really transformed. Then their dirty, sooty 
planet, with its felled forests and litter of 
paper and broken glass, bricks and rusty iron, 
would have been seen in its real light. Our 
ancestors would have had a better under-
standing of what still had to be done and 
would 
not 
have blinded themselves with 
self-praise. 

A narrow well, thirty-two metres deep, 
led down to the next cave. Veda sent Miyiko 
and two other assistants back for the gamma-
ray apparatus to examine the contents of the 
show-cases and herself went to examine the 
third cave that had not been affected by lime 
and clay deposits. The low, 
quadrangular 
plate-glass show-cases were only misty from 
the damp that had penetrated into the cave. 
Pressing their faces against the glass the ar-
chaeologists saw the most remarkable articles 
of gold and platinum decorated with pre-
cious stones. Judging by the workmanship 
these ancient relics had been collected at a 
time when people still had more respect for 
the old than for the new, a habit that had 
come into being in very ancient days when 
people worshipped their ancestors. As Veda 

looked at the collection she felt the same 
disappointment in the people of olden days 
as she had done when she read the inscription 
on the wall; she was annoyed at the absurd 
self-confidence of the ancients who believed 
that their idea of values and their tastes 
would continue unchanged for dozens of cen-
turies and would be accepted as canons by 
their descendants. 

The far end of the cave merged into a high, 
straight passage that sloped down to an un-
known depth. The instruments on the explor-
er cars showed a depth of three hundred and 
four metres from the surface at the beginning 
of the corridor. Huge crevices divided the ceil-
ing into a number of separate limestone blocks 
that probably weighed several thousand tons 
each. Veda felt alarmed: her experience in the 
exploration of many underground premises 
told her that the rocks at the foot of the 
mountain chain were certain to be in a state 
of instability. The mass of rock may have 
been shifted by an earthquake or by the gene-
ral rise of the mountains that had grown at 
least fifty metres higher in the centuries that 
had elapsed since the caves had been sealed. 
An ordinary archaeological expedition had 
no means at its disposal to strengthen such 
a huge mass. Only an objective of impor-
tance to the planet's economy would have 
justified the expenditure necessary for the 
job. 

At the same time historical secrets hidden 
in the deep cave might be of technical value, 
they might consist of such things as forgotten 

inventions that would be of value in modern 
times. 

It would have been nothing more than 
wise precaution to abandon all further explo-
ration. But why should a historian be so 
very careful of his own person? When millions 
of people were carrying out risky experi-
ments and doing risky jobs, when Darr Veter 
and his companions were working at a height 
of fifty-seven thousand kilometres above the 
Earth, when Erg Noor was preparing to start 
out on a voyage from which there would be 
no return! Neither of these men whom Veda 
admired would have hesitated ... nor would 
she! 

They would 
take reserve batteries, an 
electronic camera, two oxygen apparatuses 
and would go alone, she and the fearless Miyi-
ko, leaving their companions to study the 
third cave. 

Veda advised her workers to take a meal 
to keep up their strength. They got out their 
travellers' cakes, slabs of pressed, easily assi-
milated 
proteins, sugars and 
preparations 
destroying the toxins of weariness 
mixed 
with vitamins, hormones and nerve stimulants. 
Veda, nervously impatient, did not want to 
eat. Miyiko appeared some forty minutes la-
ter, she had been unable to resist the tempta-
tion of examining the contents of some of 
the show-cases with her gamma-rays. 

The descendant of Japanese women divers 
thanked her principal with a glance and got 
herself ready in the twinkling of an eye. 

The thin red cables stretched down the 

centre of the passage. The pale light emanat-
ing from the phosphorescent crowns worn 
by the two women was insufficient to pene-
trate the thousand-year-old darkness that lay 
ahead of them where the slope grew steeper. 
Big drops of cold water dripped steadily and 
dully from the roof. To the sides and below 
them they could hear the gurgle of streams of 
water running in the crevices. The air, saturat-
ed with moisture, was as still as death in that 
enclosed underground chamber. The silence 
was such as exists only in caves where it is 
guarded by the dead and inert matter of 
Earth's crust. Outside, no matter how great 
the silence may be, nature's hidden life, the 
movement of water, air and light may always 
be assumed. 

Miyiko and Veda were unwittingly hypno-
tized by the cave that drew them into its 
black depths as though into the depths of a 
dead past that had been wiped out by time 
and lived only as figments of the imagination. 

The descent was rapid although there was 
a thick layer of sticky clay on the floor. 
Blocks of stone fallen from the walls at times 
barred the way and had to be climbed over, 
the women crawling through the narrow space 
left between the fall and the roof. In half an 
hour Miyiko and Veda had descended another 
one hundred and ninety metres into the earth 
and reached a perfectly smooth wall at the 
foot of which the two explorer robots lay mo-
tionless. One flash of light was enough to 
show them that the smooth wall was a mas-
sive, hermetically sealed door of stainless 

steel. In the middle of the door were two 
convex circles with certain symbols on them, 
handles and gilded arrows. The lock opened 
when a pre-arranged signal had been selected. 
The two archaeologists knew of such safes 
belonging to an earlier period. After a short 
consultation Veda and Miyiko made a closer 
examination of the lock. It was very much 
like those malignantly clever constructions 
that people once used to keep other people's 
hands off 
their 
property—in 
the 
Era 
of 
Disunity people were divided in that way into 
"us" and "others". There had been a number 
of cases when an attempt to open such doors 
had caused an explosion or the emission of 
poisonous gases or deadly radiations, killing 
the unsuspecting investigators. The mecha-
nism of such locks, made of non-oxidizing 
metals or plastics, was not affected by time: 
a large number of people had fallen victim 
to these steel doors before archaeologists had 
learned to render them harmless. 

It was obvious that the door had to be 
opened with special instruments. They would 
have to go all the way back from the very 
threshold of the cave's main secret. Who 
could doubt that the locked door would hide 
the most important and valuable possession 
of the people of those distant times? Putting 
out their lamps and making do with the glow 
of their phosphorescent crowns, Veda and 
Miyiko sat down to rest and eat in order to 
be able to repeat their attempt. 

"What can there be in there?" asked Miyi-
ko with a sigh, never once taking her eyes off 

the door and its haughtily gleaming gold 
symbols. " I t seems to be laughing at us. 'I 
won't let you in, I won't tell you anything!' " 

"What did you see in the cupboards you 
gamma-rayed 
in the second cave?" asked 
Veda, driving away her primitive and useless 
chagrin at this unexpected obstacle. 

"Drawings of machines, books printed on 
metal sheets instead of on the old-fashioned 
paper made from wood. Then there was 
something that looked like rolls of films, 
some sort of lists, stellar and terrestrial maps." 

"In the first hall there are samples of 
machines and in the second there are the tech-
nical documents belonging to them and in the 
third there are, well, what can I call them?— 
historical relics and the valuables of the pe-
riod when money still existed. It all follows 
the usual scheme." 

"Where are the things that we regard as 
being valuable? The loftiest achievements of 
man's 
spiritual 
development—science, 
art, 
literature?" exclaimed Miyiko. 

" I hope they're behind that door," an-
swered Veda, calmly, "but I should not be at 
all surprised if there were weapons there." 

"What? What did you say?" 
"Weapons, 
armaments, 
the 
means 
of 
slaughtering masses of people in the shortest 
possible time. I don't think that such an 
assumption is either fantastic or pessimistic!" 

Little Miyiko thought it over for a while 
and then said: 

"Yes, that seems to be quite regular if you 
think of the object of this cache. The chief 

technical and material values of the Western 
civilization of those days are hidden here. 
What did they regard as fundamental? If the 
public opinion of the planet as a whole or 
even of nations or of a group of countries 
did not then exist? The necessity or the 
importance of anything at any given moment 
was decided by the ruling group of people 
who were not always competent to judge. 
That is why the things here were not really 
the most valuable possessions of mankind 
but those things that the given group deemed 
valuable. They tried to preserve chiefly ma-
chines and, possibly, weapons, not realizing 
that civilisation is built up historically, like a 
living organism," added Miyiko, thoughtfully. 

"Yes, by the growth and acquisition of 
working experience, knowledge, techniques, 
stores of materials, pure chemical substances 
and buildings. The restoration of high civi-
lizations would have been impossible without 
highly durable alloys, rare metals, machines 
with a high productivity and great precision. 
If all these things were destroyed where 
would they be able to get them from and 
where would they get the experience and 
ability to build complicated cybernetic ma-
chines capable of satisfying the needs of 
thousands of millions of people?" 

" I t would have been just as impossible to 
return to a premachine-age civilization, like 
that of antiquity, although some people did 
dream of it." 

"Of course. Instead of the civilization of 
antiquity they would have been faced with a 

terrible 
famine. 
Those 
were 
individualist 
dreamers who did not want to understand 
that history does not turn back." 

" I ' m not insisting that there are armaments 
in there," said Veda, "but there is every 
reason to suppose there are. If the men who 
devised this cache made the mistake that was 
typical of their day in confusing culture and 
civilization and ignoring the absolute necessi-
ty of training and developing a man, they 
would certainly not have seen the vital neces-
sity for preserving works of art, literature or 
research far removed from current needs. In 
those days science was divided into useful 
and useless sciences and no thought was 
given to their unity. There were branches 
of art and science that were regarded as 
being merely pleasant but by no means an 
essential or even useful accompaniment to 
the life of mankind. Here, in this cave, the 
most important things are preserved, that's 
why 
I think of weapons, no matter how 
foolish and naive that may seem to us to-
day." 

Veda stopped talking and stared at the 
door. 

"Perhaps that's just a cipher lock and we 
can open it by listening to it with a micro-
phone," she said suddenly, walking over to 
the door. "Shall we risk it?" 

Miyiko jumped between her friend and 
the door. 

"No, Veda, why take such a foolish risk?" 
" I t seems to me that the roof of this cave 
is very insecure. We'll go away from here 

and we'll never have a chance to come back. 
Listen!.." 

A diffused and distant sound from time 
to time penetrated into the cave in front 
of the door. It came sometimes from below, 
sometimes from above. 

Miyiko, however, was adamant, she stood 
with her back to the door and her arms out-
stretched. 

"You think there are weapons in there, 
Veda. If there are they must be well protect-
ed. No, no ... it's an evil door, like many 
others." 

Two days later a portable X-ray reflector 
screen to study the mechanism and a fo-
cussed high-frequency radiator for the mole-
cular destruction of parts of the door were 
brought into the cave. They did not, however, 
have time to set their apparatus to work. 

Suddenly 
an intermittent roar 
resound-
ed through the caves. Strong earth tremors 
underfoot sent the people who were in the 
third cave running instinctively to the exit. 

The noise increased until it became a dull 
rumble. The whole mass of fissured rock was 
apparently settling along the line of the fault 
at the foot of the mountains. 

"Save 
yourselves, everybody 
get 
out!" 
shouted Veda and her people ran to the robot 
cars, directing them towards the entrance to 
the second cave. 

Hanging on to the cables of the robots 
they scrambled out of the well. The noise 
and the tremors of the stone walls followed 

close on their heels and, at last, overtook 
them. There came a fearful crash as the walls 
of the second cave tumbled into the abyss 
that had formed where the wall had been 
seconds before. The blast of air 
literally 
carried the people together with a shower of 
dust and rubble into the first cave. There the 
archaeologists threw themselves on the floor 
and awaited death. 

The clouds of 
dust 
began to subside. 
Through the dusty haze it could be seen that 
the 
stalagmites 
and the niches had 
not 
changed their form. The former gravelike 
silence returned to the caves. 

Veda came to and stood up, trembling 
from the reaction. Two of her assistants took 
hold of her but she shook them off impatiently. 

"Where's Miyiko?" 
Her friend was leaning against a low stalag-
mite, carefully wiping the dust from her neck, 
ears and hair. 

"Almost everything has been lost," she 
said in answer to an unasked question. "The 
impassable door will remain closed under 
a four-hundred-metre thick layer of stone. 
The third cave has been completely destroyed 
but the second can be excavated. There and in 
this cave are the things of greatest value to us/' 

"You're right." Veda licked her dry lips. 
"We were wrong in dallying and being over-
careful. We should have foreseen the fall." 

"You had only unfounded instinct to go 
on. But there's nothing to worry about, we 
would hardly have tried to prop up those 
masses of rock for the sake of very doubt-

ful treasures behind that closed door. Espe-
cially if it is full of worthless weapons." 

"But suppose there are works of art there, 
inestimable human creation? We could have 
worked faster!" 

Miyiko shrugged her shoulders and led the 
depressed Veda in the wake of their compa-
nions, out into the magnificence of a sunny 
day, to the joy of clean water and an electric 
shower to drown all pain. 

As was his habit, Mven Mass strode back 
and forth in the room that had been allotted 
him on the top floor of the History House 
in the Indian Section of the northern inhabit-
ed zone. He had arrived there but two days 
before, after having finished work in the 
History 
House 
in the 
American 
Section. 

The room, or verandah with an outer wall 
of polarizing glass, looked out on the blue 
distance of the hilly plateau. Mven Mass from 
time to time switched on the cross polariza-
tion shutters. The room was plunged into 
grey 
gloom and pieces of old cinema films, 
sculptures and buildings that he had select-
ed appeared on the hemispherical screen. 
The 
African watched them and 
dictated 
notes for his future book to a robot-secretary. 
The 
machine 
printed and numbered 
the 
sheets, folded and sorted them according to 
subject 
matter, descriptions or 
generaliza-
tions. 

When he grew tired Mven Mass switched 
off the shutters and walked over to the win-
dow to stare into the distance with unseeing 

eyes as he stood for a long time thinking over 
what he had seen. 

He could not help but feel amazed that 
much of mankind's recent culture had already 
passed into the limbo. Verbal finesse that 
had been so typical of the Era of World Uni-
ty, oral and written whimsicalities that had 
at one time been regarded as the hallmark 
of a good education, had completely disap-
peared. Writing for the sake of beauty, so 
widespread in the Era of Common Labour, 
had gone and with it the juggling with words 
that went by the name of witticism. Still 
earlier the necessity to hide one's thoughts, 
an important matter in the Era of Disunity, 
had ceased to exist. All talk had become 
simpler and terser and it seemed that the 
Great Circle Era would become the era of 
the third system of signals—comprehension 
without words. 

From time to time Mven Mass turned 
to the ever wakeful mechanical secretary 
with his new thoughts. 

"The fluctuating psychology of art had its 
beginning in the second century of the Great 
Circle Era and was founded by Liuda Pheer. 
She first gave a scientific proof of the differ-
ence in the emotional perception of men and 
women and laid bare that sphere that had 
for centuries 
been regarded as the semi-
mystic subconscious. The proofs she offered 
for the understanding of her contemporaries, 
however, constituted the lesser part of her 
work. Liuda Pheer did more—she indicated 
the main series of sensual perceptions that 

made it possible to achieve similarity in the 
perception of the two sexes." 

A ringing signal and a green light suddenly 
called 
Mven 
Mass to 
the 
televisophone. 
A call that came during working hours meant 
something very urgent. The automatic secre-
tary was switched off and Mven Mass hurried 
downstairs to the room where long-distance 
calls were received. 

Veda Kong, with bruised and scratched 
cheeks and with deep shadows under her 
eyes, greeted him from the screen. Mven 
Mass was pleased to see her and held out his 
huge hands to her, causing Veda's worried 
face to break into a faint smile. 

"Help me, Mven. I know you're working 
but Darr Veter isn't on Earth and Erg Noor 
is far away; besides them you're the only one 
I have to whom I can turn with any request. 
I've had a misfortune." 

"What? Darr Veter..." 
"No, a cave collapsed during excavations." 
Veda gave him a brief description of what 
had happened in the Hall of Culture. 

"You're the only one of my friends who 
has free access to the Prophetic 
Brain." 

"To which of the four?" 
"The Brain of Lower Definition." 
" I understand, you want me to calculate 
the possibility of reaching the door with a 
minimum 
expenditure of labour and ma-
terial." 

"Exactly." 
"Have you got the data?" 
"I have them before me." 

"All right. I'm listening." 
Mven Mass wrote down some columns of 
figures very rapidly. 

"Now you'll have to wait until the machine 
can accept my figures. If you wait I'll get in 
touch with the Prophetic Brain engineer on 
duty. The Brain of Lower Definition is in the 
Australian Section of the southern zone." 

"Where is the Brain of Higher Definition?" 
"That's in the Indian Section, where I am 
now. I'm changing over. Wait for me." 

As Veda stood before the empty screen 
she tried to imagine the Prophetic Brain. 
Her imagination pictured a gigantic human 
brain with 
its furrows and convolutions, 
alive and pulsating, although the young wom-
an knew that they were electronic research 
machines of the highest class, capable of solv-
ing any problem that could be solved by the 
known branches of mathematics. There were 
only four such machines on the planet and 
they all had special uses. 

Veda did not have long to wait. The screen 
lit up and Mven Mass asked her to call him 
again in six days' time, later in the evening. 

"Mven, your help is invaluable!" 
"Just because I know something of the 
rules of mathematics, is that it? And your 
work is invaluable because you know the 
ancient languages and cultures. Veda, you're 
overdoing it 
with 
the 
Era of 
Disunity!" 

The historian 
frowned 
but Mven Mass 
laughed with such good nature and so infec-
tiously that Veda also laughed, waved him 
good-bye and disappeared. 

At the appointed time Mven Mass again 
saw the young woman in the televisophone. 

"You needn't speak, I see by your face 
that the answer is unfavourable." 

"Yes, stability is below the safety limit. 
If you go straight to it you will have to 
remove almost a million cubic metres of 
rock." 

" I t will only be possible for us to tunnel 
to the second cave and remove the safes," 
said Veda, sadly. 

"Is it a matter of such distress?" 
"Excuse me, Mven, but you have also 
stood before a door that hid an unfathomed 
secret. Yours are great, universal secrets and 
mine are tiny little ones. Emotionally, how-
ever, my failure is the equal of 
yours!" 

"We're companions in misfortune. I can 
tell you that we'll be knocking our heads 
against closed doors many times, yet. The 
stronger and more courageous our efforts 
the more often we shall come up against doors." 

"One of them will open!" 
"Naturally." 
"You 
haven't given up altogether, have 
you?" 

"Of 
course not, we're collecting fresh 
facts and the 
indicants of 
more correct 
methods." 

"And suppose you have to wait all your 

life?" 

"What is my individual life compared with 
such a step forward in knowledge!" 

"Mven, what has happened to your passion-
ate impatience?" 

" I t hasn't disappeared, it's been curbed—by 
suffering." 

"How's Renn Bose?" 
"He's better. He's looking for ways to 
make his abstractions more precise." 

"I see. Wait a minute, Mven, there's some-
thing important for me!" 

Veda disappeared from the screen and 
when the light flashed on again, she was 
another, younger and more carefree woman. 

"Darr Veter is returning to Earth. Satellite 
57 is being completed ahead of time." 

"As quickly as that? Is it finished?" 
"No, it's not finished, they've only put 
on the outer walls of the hull and mounted 
the engines. The work inside is easier. He is 
being called back to rest and to analyze Ju-
nius Antus's report on a new form of commu-
nication around the Great Circle." 

"Thanks, Veda. I'll be glad to see Darr 
Veter." 

"You'll see him all right. I didn't finish. 
Supplies of anameson for the new spaceship 
Lebed 
have been prepared by the efforts 
of the whole planet. The crew invite you to 
see them off on the journey from which 
there will be no return. Will you come?" 

"I'll be there. The planet will show Le-
bed'% crew everything that is beautiful and 
lovable in the world. They also wanted to 
see Chara's dance at the Fete of the Flaming 
Bowls. She is going to repeat her perfor-
mance at the central cosmoport in El Homra. 
We'll meet there!" 

"Good, Mven Mass, my friend." 

Chapter Fifteen 

T H E A N D R O M E D A N E B U L A 

The huge plain of El 
Homra 
stretched 
away to the south of the Gulf of Sirt in North 
Africa. Up to the time the trade winds and 
doldrums were eliminated it had been known 
as Hammada, the Red Desert, a waste of sand 
and 
stone, 
especially 
the 
triangular 
red 
stones that had given it its name. In summer 
it had been an ocean of scorching sunlight 
and during the autumn and winter nights it 
became an ocean of cold winds. Only the 
wind now remained of the old Hammada and 
that sent wave after wave across the tall sil-
very-blue grass that covered the firm soil of 
the plain; the grass had been transplanted 
from the South African velds. The whistl-
ing of the wind and the bowed grass awakened 
in man's memory an uncertain feeling of 

sorrow and, at the same time, a feeling that 
the great grassy plains are somehow close to 
his heart, something that he had met with be-
fore in his life—not just once before, but 
many times and under different circumstances, 
in sorrow and in joy, in good times and bad. 

Every take-off or landing of a spaceship 
left behind a circle, about a kilometre in 
diameter, of scorched and poisoned earth. 
These circles were surrounded by red metal 
screens and were out of bounds for a period 
of ten years, twice as long as the harmful 
fall-out from the spaceship's exhaust would 
be active. After each landing or take-off the 
cosmoport was transferred to another place 
which gave its buildings the imprint of tempo-
rariness and made its staff kin to the ancient 
nomads of the Sahara who for thousands of 
years traversed the desert on a special kind of 
animal with a humped back, a long curved 
neck and big corns on its paws, an animal 
called the camel. 

The planetship Barion 
on its thirteenth 
journey between the satellite under construc-
tion and Earth brought Darr Veter to the 
Arizona Plain that, on account of the accumu-
lated radioactivity there, still remained a de-
sert even after the climate had changed. At 
the very dawn of the application of nuclear 
energy in the Era of Disunity, many experi-
ments and tests of this new technique had 
been carried out there. The radioactive fall-
out has remained to this day—it is now too 
weak to harm man but is sufficient to check 
the growth of trees and bushes. 

Darr Veter took pleasure not only in the 
great charm of Earth—its blue sky in a bridal 
gown of white clouds—but also in the dusty 
soil, the scanty, tough grass.... 

How wonderful it was to walk with a firm 
tread on solid earth, under the golden rays 
of the Sun and with his face turned to meet 
the fresh dry breeze. After he had been on 
the threshold of Cosmic space he could better 
appreciate the full beauty of our planet that 
our ancestors had once called "the vale of 
tears and sorrow". 

Grom Orme did not detain the builder for 
he 
himself 
wanted 
to 
be present 
when 
Lebed took off. They arrived at El Hombra 
together on the day the expedition was to 
leave. 

While still air-borne Darr Veter noticed 
huge patches on the dull steel-grey plain—the 
one on the right was almost circular and the 
other was more elongated, an oval with the 
narrow end turned away from the other. 
These patches had been made by the space-
ships of the 38th Cosmic Expedition that had 
recently left. 

The circle came from the spaceship Tin-
tangelle that had gone to the terrible star T 
and was loaded with all sorts of apparatus for 
the siege of the disc ship from distant worlds. 
The oval was made by Aella whose ascent was 
less steep; this ship was taking a large group of 
scientists to investigate the changes in matter 
that took place on the white dwarf of the 
triple star Omicron 2 Eridani. The ash that 
remained where the ships' exhausts had burnt 

up the stony ground was about five feet 
thick and was covered with a binding mate-
rial to prevent its being wind-carried. All that 
remained was to move the red fences from the 
old take-off ground, and this would be done 
as soon as Lebed left. 

And there stood Lebed, iron-grey in her 
heat armour that would burn off during her 
passage through the atmosphere. After that 
the ship would continue its flight with gleam-
ing walls capable of reflecting any known 
radiations. Nobody, however, would see it 
in this magnificence except the robot-astro-
nomers that tracked the flight: these ma-
chines would provide the people with nothing 
more than photographs of a flashing dot 
in the sky. When a ship came back to Earth 
it was always covered with dross and scored 
with furrows and hollows made by the ex-
plosions of tiny meteoric bodies. Darr Veter 
remembered 
how 
Tantra 
had 
returned— 
greyish-green and rust-red with parts of her 
outer walling in a state of collapse. None 
of the people standing around Lebed would 
ever see her again since none of them could 
live the hundred and seventy-two years that 
must elapse before she returned—a hundred 
and sixty-eight independent years of travel 
and four 
years to 
explore the 
planets... 

Darr Veter's work was such that he would 
probably not live long enough even for the 
ship to arrive at the planet of the green star. 
Just as in those days of doubt, Darr Veter 
once again felt 
great admiration for 
the 
bold ideas of Renn Bose and Mven Mass. 

What did it matter that their experiment had 
failed—what did it matter that the problem, 
one which affected the very foundations of 
the Cosmos, was still far from solution— 
what did it matter, if it was all nothing more 
than a figment of imagination... These eccen-
trics were giants of creative thought 
for 
even in the refutation of their theories and 
the failure of their experiments people would 
make tremendous progress in many fields 
of knowledge. 

Lost 
in 
thought, 
Darr 
Veter 
almost 
stumbled over the signal indicating the safety 
zone, turned round and saw a well-known 
figure. Running his fingers through his unruly 
red hair and screwing up his sharp eyes, Renn 
Bose came running towards him. A network 
of 
thin, 
scarcely 
perceptible 
scars 
had 
changed the face of the physicist by wrinkling 
it into an expression of pained intensity. 

"I'm glad to see you well again, Renn!" 
"I want you urgently!" said Renn Bose, 
holding his tiny freckled hands out to Veter. 

"What are you doing here, so long before 
the" take-off?" 

"I saw Aella 
off, I'm very interested in 
the gravitation of such a heavy star. I heard 
you would come and so I waited for you." 

Darr 
Veter 
waited for an explanation. 

"I hear you are returning to the observato-
ry of the Outer Stations as Junius Antus has 
requested." 

Darr Veter nodded. 
"Antus 
has 
recently 
recorded 
several 
undeciphered 
messages 
received 
from 
a 

Great Circle transmission." 

"Every month messages are received out-
side the usual transmission hours and each 
month 
the transmission time is advanced 
by two terrestrial hours. In the course of a 
year's testing this amounts to an earthly day 
and in eight years it makes a whole hundred 
thousandth of a galactic second. That is how 
the gaps in the reception of the Cosmos are 
filled in. During the last six months of the 
eight-year cycle we have been receiving in-
comprehensible messages that undoubtedly 
come from a great distance." 

"I'm very interested in them and would 
like you to take me as your assistant." 

" I t would be better for me to help you. 
We'll examine the records of the memory 
machines together." 

"What about Mven Mass?" 
"We'll take him, of course." 
"Veter, that's just wonderful. I feel very 
awkward since that ill-fated experiment of 
mine, I've a feeling of guilt as far as the Coun-
cil is concerned. But I can get along easily 
with you even if you are a member of the 
Council and a former Director and the one 
who advised me against the experiment." 

"Mven Mass is also a member of the Coun-
cil." 

The physicist thought for a while, smiled 
at some memory of his own. 

"Mven Mass, he has a feeling for my ideas 
and tries to concretize them for me." 

"Wasn't it in the concretization that you 
made a mistake?" 

Renn 
Bose 
frowned 
and changed 
the 
subject. 

"Is Veda Kong coming here?" 
"Yes, I'm waiting for her. Did you know 
that she almost lost her life during the in-
vestigation of a cave, some ancient technical 
storehouse where there was a closed steel 
door?" 

"It's the first I've heard of it." 
" I forgot that unlike Mven Mass you have 
no great interest in history. The whole planet 
is discussing the affair and wondering what 
might be behind the door. Millions of people 
have volunteered to dig it out. Veda has 
given the problem to the Academy of Sto-
chastics and Prognostication. Is Evda Nahl 
coming here?" 

"No, she can't come." 
" A 
lot of people will be disappointed! 
Veda's very fond of Evda and Chara is simply 
devoted to her. D'you remember Chara?" 

"That's 
the 
panther-like 
girl ... 
either 
Gypsy or Indian in origin?" 

Darr 
Veter 
spread his hands in mock 
horror. 

"How weJI you appreciate feminine beau-
ty! However, I'm always making the mistake 
that people made in the past when they did 
not know anything about the laws of psycho-
physiology and heredity. I always want to 
see my feelings and my perceptions in other 
people." 

"Evda, like everybody else on the planet," 
said Renn Bose, ignoring Veter's confessions, 
"will be watching the take-off." 

The physicist pointed to a row of high 
tripods carrying chambers for white, infra-
red and ultra-violet reception placed in a 
semi-circle around the spaceship. The dif-
ferent groups of spectral rays introduced into 
the coloured reproduction made the screen 
breathe with real warmth and life in the same 
way as the overtone diaphragms27 destroyed 
the metallic resonance in the transmission 
of the human voice. 

Darr 
Veter 
looked towards the 
north 
whence came the heavily laden automatic 
electrobuses, swaying across the earth. Veda 
Kong jumped out of the first bus to arrive and 
ran towards them, catching her feet in the 
grass. At a run she threw herself on Darr 
Veter's broad chest with such force that the 
long plaits that hung down from either side of 
her head were thrown over his shoulders and 
hung down his back. 

Darr Veter held Veda off at some distance 
and looked into that infinitely dear face to 
which 
her unusual 
hair-do imparted new 
qualities. 

"I was playing the Northern Queen of the 
Dark Ages for a children's film," she said, 
panting 
slightly. 
"I 
hardly 
had time 
to 
change and could not stop to do my hair." 

Darr Veter could imagine her in a long, 
tight brocade dress and a golden crown with 
blue stones, her ash-blonde plaits reaching 
down below her knees, with fearless grey 
eyes—and he smiled with pleasure. 

"Did you wear a crown?" 
"Oh, yes, and such a crown!" Veda's finger 

drew in the air the outline of a wide circle 
with teeth round it in the shape of clover 
leaves. 

"Shall I see it?" 
"This very day. I'll ask them to show you 
the film." 

Darr Veter was going to ask who the 
"they" were but Veda was already greeting 
the serious-looking physicist who was smiling 
naively but whole-heartedly. 

"Where 
are the heroes of 
Achernar?" 
asked Renn Bose looking at the spaceship that 
stood in splendid isolation. 

"Over there!" Veda pointed to a tent-
shaped building of milk-coloured glass and 
outside 
girders 
of 
lattice-work—the 
main 
hall of the cosmoport. 

"Let's go there, then." 
"We're 
not wanted there," 
said Veda, 
firmly. "They are watching Earth's farewell 
to them. Let's go to Lebed." 

The men followed her advice. 
As she walked beside Darr Veter she asked 
softly: 

"Do I look too absurd in this old-fashioned 
hair-do? I could..." 

"You don't need to do anything. It makes 
a charming contrast to your modern dress, 
plaits longer than your skirt. Let it stay!" 

"I obey you, my Veter!" Veda whispered 
the magic words that made his heart beat 
faster and brought colour to his pale cheeks. 

Hundreds of people were making their 
way unhurriedly to the ship. Many of them 
smiled to V^da or greeted her with a raised 

hand, much more frequently than they did 
Darr Veter or Renn Bose. 

"You're very popular, Veda," said Renn 
Bose, "is that due to your work as a historian 
or to your notorious beauty?" 

"Neither one nor the other. I mix with a 
lot of people both in my work and in my 
social engagements. 
You and Veter, you 
either hide in the depths of laboratory or go 
away alone for some terrible straining night 
work. You do more for mankind and much 
more important things than I do but it is 
all one-sided and not for the side that is 
nearer the 
heart. Chara Nandi and Evda 
Nahl are much more widely known than 
I am." 

"Again a reproach to our technical civi-
lization?" asked Darr Veter, jokingly. 

"Not to ours but to the left-overs of former 
fatal mistakes. Twenty thousand years ago 
our troglodyte ancestors knew that art and 
development of sensations connected with it 
were 
no less important to 
society 
than 
science." 

"In respect to relations between people?" 
asked the physicist, with interest. 

"Exactly." 
"There was an ancient sage who said that 
the most difficult thing on earth is to pre-
serve joy!" Darr Veter put in. "Look, here 
comes another of Veda's loyal allies!" 

Mven Mass, with a light, swinging tread, 
was coming straight towards them, his huge 
black figure 
attracting considerable atten-
tion. 

"Chara's dance is over!" Veda guessed. 
"Soon we'll see the crew of Lebed." 

"If I were them I'd come over here on foot 
and as slowly as possible," said Darr Veter, 
suddenly. 

"You're getting excited," said Veda taking 
him by the arm. 

"Naturally. For me it's painful to think 
that they're going away for ever and that 
I'll never see that ship again. There's some-
thing inside me that protests against that 
inescapable doom, perhaps because there are 
people in the ship dear to me!" 

"That's probably not the reason," said 
Mven Mass as he joined them. His sharp ears 
had caught Darr Veter's words. "It's the 
inevitable protest of man against implacable 
time." 

"Autumn sorrow?" asked Renn Bose, with 
just a shade of irony as he smiled at his friend 
with his eyes. 

"Have you noticed that it is the most 
energetic, vivacious people with the strongest 
feelings who mostly like the sad autumn of 
the temperate zones?" objected Mven Mass 
patting the physicist on the shoulder in a 
friendly way. 

"That's true enough!" exclaimed 
Veda. 

" A very ancient observation." 
"Darr Veter, are you there on the field? 
Darr Veter, are you there on the field? You 
are wanted on the televisophone of the cent-
ral building by Junius Antus. Junius Antus is 
calling you on the TVP of the central build-
ing." 

Renn Bose started and straightened up. 
"May I go with you, Veter?" 
"Go along in my place. It doesn't matter 
much to you if you miss the take-off. Junius 
Antus likes showing things in the old way, 
the direct reception and not the recording; 
in that respect he is in complete agreement 
with Mven Mass." 

The 
cosmoport 
possessed 
a 
powerful 
TVP 
receiver and a hemispherical screen. 
Renn 
Bose entered a quiet round 
room. 
The operator on duty pressed a button and 
pointed to a side screen where the excited 
Junius 
Antus 
appeared 
immediately. 
He 
looked closely at the physicist and, realiz-
ing why Darr Veter had not come, nodded 
to Bose. 

"I 
also intended watching the take-off 
but at the moment there is an explorer-
reception going on in the former direction 
in the 62/77 range. Take the directed ray 
funnel and focus it on the observatory. I'll 
send a vector ray across the Mediterranean 
to El Hombra. Pick it up on the tubular fan 
and switch on the hemispherical screen." 
Junius Antus looked away for a moment 
and then added, "Hurry up!" 

The scientist, experienced in Cosmic re-
ception, did all that had been ordered within 
two minutes. In the depths of the hemisphe-
rical screen a gigantic galaxy appeared which 
both scientists recognized as the Androme-
da Nebula, or M 31, long known to man-
kind. 

In the outer turn of its spiral, the one 

nearest the onlookers, and almost in the very 
centre of the lentil-shaped disc of the enor-
mous galaxy, a tiny light appeared. There a 
whole system of stars branched off, looking 
like a thin hair although it was no doubt 
a huge sleeve of the galaxy a hundred par-
sees in length. The light began to grow and 
the hair became bigger, while the galaxy 
disappeared 
beyond 
the 
field 
of 
vision. 
A stream of red and yellow stars stretched 
across the screen. The light changed into a 
little circle that gleamed at the end of the 
star stream. On the edge of the stream there 
was a prominent orange star, spectral class K, 
and around it the barely perceptible dots of 
planets were revolving. A disc of light was 
placed over one of them, completely cover-
ing it. Suddenly it all began to whirl round 
in red curves with sparks flying out of them. 
Renn Bose closed his eyes. 

"That's 
a rupture," 
said Junius Antus 
from the side screen. "I've shown you a me-
mory 
machine recording of what we ob-
served last month. Now I'm going to switch 
on to a direct reception." 

Sparks and dark-red lines were still whirl-
ing round on the screen. 

"What a peculiar phenomenon!" exclaimed 
the physicist. "How do you explain that 
'rupture', as you call it?" 

"I'll tell you later. The transmission is 
beginning again. But what is it you think 
strange?" 

"The red spectrum of the rupture. In the 
Andromeda spectrum there is a violet bias. 

in other words, it should be drawing closer 
to us." 

"The 
rupture 
has nothing to do with 
Andromeda, 
it 
is a local 
phenomenon!" 

"Do you think it accidental that their 
transmitting station is placed on the very 
edge of the galaxy, in a zone that is even 
farther removed from the centre than the 
zone of the Sun in our Galaxy?" 

Junius Antus cast a sceptical glance at 
Renn Bose. 

"You're prepared to start a discussion at 
any moment, forgetting that you're talking 
with the Andromeda Nebula at a distance 
of 450,000 parsecs!" 

"Yes, 
yes," 
muttered 
the 
embarrassed 
Renn Bose, "that is, at a distance of a million 
and a half light years. This communication 
was transmitted fifteen thousand centuries 
ago." 

"What we're looking at now was sent out 
long before the Ice Age and the appearance 
of man on Earth!" Junius Antus had be-
come more amicable. 

The red lines slowed down their move-
ments, the screen went dark and then lit up 
again. A dully lit plain could scarcely be 
discerned in the twilight with mushroom-
shaped structures dotted 
here and there. 
Near the front a gigantic (judging by the 
extent of the plain) blue circle with an ob-
viously metallic surface gleamed coldly. One 
above the other two huge discs, convex on 
both sides, hung directly over the centre of 
the blue circle. No ... they were not hanging 

but were slowly rising higher and higher. 
The plain vanished and only one of the discs 
remained on the screen; it was more convex 
below than above and there were crudely 
spiral ribs on both sides. 

"Is it they ... is it they?!" exclaimed both 
scientists, almost together, thinking of the 
perfect similarity of this image with the pho-
tographs and drawings of the spiral disc the 
37th Cosmic Expedition had found on the 
planet of the iron star. 

Another whirl of red lines and the screen 
went dead. Renn Bose waited, afraid to take 
his eyes off the screen for even a second. 
The first human eye to see something of the 
life and thoughts of another galaxy! The 
screen, however, did not show any further 
signs of life. Junius Antus spoke from the 
sidescreen of the TVP: 

"The transmission has broken off. We can-
not wait any longer because we are using too 
much of Earth's power resources. The whole 
planet will be astounded. We must ask the 
Economic Council for reception hours outside 
the 
regular 
programme 
at intervals more 
frequent than at present, but that will only be 
possible in a year's time, after so much has 
been spent on the dispatch of Lebed. Now 
we know that the spaceship on the black 
planet is from there. If Erg Noor had not 
found it we should never have understood 
what we have seen." 

"And that disc came from there? How long 
did it fly?" asked Renn Bose, as though talk-
ing to himself. 

" I t has been flying dead for about two 
million years through the space that divides 
our two galaxies," answered Junius Antus, 
sternly, from the screen. " I t flew until it 
found refuge on the planet of star T. Those 
spaceships are apparently built to land auto-
matically despite the fact that for thousands 
and thousands of years no living hand has 
touched their control mechanisms." 

"Perhaps they live a long time?" 
"But not millions of years, that would 
contradict 
the 
laws of 
thermodynamics," 
answered Junius Antus, coldly. "Even though 
it is of enormous size the spiral disc could 
not contain a whole planet of people ... or 
intelligences. As yet our two galaxies cannot 
reach each other, cannot exchange messa-
ges..." 

"They will," declared Renn Bose, confi-
dently, said good-bye to Junius Antus and 
returned to the cosmoport whence the space-
ship Lebed had just flown off. 

Darr Veter, Veda Kong, Chara and Mven 
Mass stood somewhat apart from the two 
long rows of people who had come to see 
the ship off. All heads were turned in the 
direction of the central building. Noiselessly 
a wide platform swept past them accom-
panied by waving hands and shouts of greet-
ing, something that people only permitted 
themselves in public on very special occasions. 
The twenty-two members of Lebed's 
crew 
were on the platform. 

The vehicle drew up against Lebed. At the 

tall retractable lift stood a number of people 
in white overalls, the twenty members of the 
ground crew, mostly engineers working at 
the cosmoport; all of them had tired, drawn 
faces. 
During the past twenty-four 
hours 
they had checked all the expedition's equip-
ment 
once more and had tested the re-
liability of the ship with the tensor appara-
tus. 

In accordance with a custom that had been 
introduced with the first Cosmic expeditions 
the Chairman of the Commission reported to 
Erg Noor who had again been appointed com-
mander of the spaceship and of the expedi-
tion to Achernar. Other members of the com-
mission embossed their codes on a bronze 
plate bearing their portraits and names, which 
was handed to 
Erg Noor; after this they 
moved away to one side and those who had 
come to bid farewell to the crew surged round 
the ship. The people drew up in front of the 
travellers, permitting their relatives to reach 
the small platform of the lift that was still 
vacant. Cinema cameramen recorded every 
gesture of the parting crew, a last memory of 
them to be left on Earth. 

Erg Noor noticed Veda Kong when she 
was still some distance away; he thrust the 
bronze certificate into his wide astronaut's 
belt and hurried to the young woman. 

"It's good of you to have come, Veda!" 
"How could I have stayed away?" 
"For me you are a symbol of Earth and my 
past youth!" 

"Nisa's youth is with you forever!" 

"I won't say I'm not sorry about anything 
because it wouldn't be true. I'm sorry, first 
of all, for Nisa, my companions and myself... 
The loss is too great. On this last time on the 
planet I've learned to love Earth in a new 
way, more strongly, simply and uncondi-
tionally." 

"But 
you're 
going, nevertheless, 
Erg?" 

" I must. If I were to refuse I should lose 
Earth as well as the Cosmos." 

"The greater the love the greater the deed." 
"You've always understood me perfectly, 
Veda. Here's Nisa. I've just been admitting 
nostalgia to Veda." 

The girl with the shock of red curls lowered 
her eyelashes: she had grown thinner and 
looked like a boy. 

" I 
never thought it would be so hard. 
You're all of you so good ... so pure ... so 
beautiful ... to leave you, to tear one's body 
away from Mother Earth..." The astronaviga-
tor's voice trembled. Veda instinctively drew 
the girl towards her, whispering the myste-
rious words of feminine comfort. 

"In 
nine 
minutes the 
hatches will be 
closed," said Erg in a soundless voice, his eyes 
fixed on Veda. 

"It's a long time yet!" exclaimed Nisa 
simply and with tears in her voice. 

Veda, Erg, Veter and Mven Mass, like others 
present, were surprised and grieved that they 
could find 
no words to say. There was 
nothing with which to express their feelings 
in face of a magnificent deed that was to be 
performed for the sake of those who did not 

yet exist and who would come many years 
later. Those who were leaving and those who 
were staying behind knew everything. What 
more could be said? 

What wishes, jokes or promises could affect 
the hearts of people who were leaving Earth 
forever to plunge into the void of the Cos-
mos? 

Man's second system of signals proved to 
be imperfect and gave way to the third. 
Profound 
glances 
expressing 
passionate 
feelings that could not be transmitted ver-
bally were met in tense silence or were 
engaged in making the most of El Homra's 
wretched landscape. 

"Time!" came Erg Noor's metallic voice 
like the snap of a herdsman's whip—the people 
hurried to board their ship. Veda, sobbing 
quite openly, pressed Nisa tightly. For a few 
seconds the two women stood cheek to 
cheek, their eyes tightly closed while the men 
exchanged parting glances and handshakes. 
The lift had already taken eight of the astro-
nauts into the black oval of the hatch. Erg 
Noor took Nisa by the hand and whispered 
something to her. The girl blushed, broke 
away and ran to the spaceship. She turned 
round before stepping into 
the 
lift 
and 
met 
the 
big eyes of 
an unusually 
pale 
Chara. 

"May I give you a kiss, Chara?" she asked 
in a loud voice. 

Chara did not answer but jumped on to the 
lift platform, trembling all over, put her arms 
round the girl astronaut, then, without a 

single word, jumped down again and ran 
away. 

Erg Noor 
and Nisa went up together. 

The crowd stood motionless as the lift 
stopped for a moment opposite the black 
hatch in the brightly illuminated hull of 
Lebed and two figures, a tall man and a grace-
ful girl, stood side by side receiving Earth's 
last greetings. 

Veda Kong clenched her fists and Darr 
Veter could hear her joints cracking. 

Erg Noor and Nisa disappeared. An oval 
door of the same grey colour as the hull 
moved out of the black opening. A second 
later the most discerning eye could not have 
detected the place where there had been an 
opening in the steep flanks of the huge hull. 

There was something human about the 
spaceship standing vertically on its landing 
struts. The impression was, perhaps, created 
by the round globe of the nose, surmounted 
by a pointed cap and gleaming with signal 
lights that looked like eyes. Or perhaps it 
was the ribbed bulkheads of the central, 
storage part of the ship that had the appear-
ance of the pauldrons of a knight's armour. 
The spaceship stood on its struts as though 
it were a giant standing on straddled legs, 
contemptuously and arrogantly peering over 
the heads of the crowd. 

The first take-off signals sounded ominous-
ly. As though by magic, wide self-propelled 
platforms appeared beside the ship to take 
away the people. The tripods of the TVP 
and the floodlights crawled away from the 

ship, too, but they kept their lenses and 
their rays fixed on it. The grey hull of Lebed 
seemed to fade away and diminish in size. 
Evil-looking red lights glowed in the ship's 
"head", the signal that the crew were ready 
to start. The vibration of its powerful motors 
made the earth tremble as the spaceship began 
to turn on its landing struts to get direction 
for the take-off. The platforms with the 
people seeing the ship off moved farther and 
farther away until they were to the leeward 
of the safety line that gleamed phosphores-
cent in the darkness. Here the people jumped 
down from the platforms and the latter went 
back for the others. 

"They'll never see us again, or our sky, 
either, will they?" asked Chara, turning to 
Mven Mass, who bent low over her. 

"No, 
unless it's 
in a stereotelescope." 

Green lights flashed up under the ship's 
keel. The radio beacon turned furiously on 
the tower of the central building sending out 
warnings of the giant ship's take-off in all 
directions. 

"The spaceship is being ordered away!" a 
metal voice of tremendous power shouted 
so suddenly that Chara shuddered and clung 
tight to Mven Mass. "Everybody inside the 
danger circle raise your hands above your 
heads. Raise your hands above your heads 
or you will be killed! Raise your hands above 
your heads or..." the automaton continued 
shouting while searchlights raked the field 
to make sure that nobody was left inside the 
danger line. 

There was nobody there and the search-
lights went out. The robot screamed again 
and, it seemed to Chara, more furiously than 
before. 

"After the bell rings turn your backs to 
the ship and shut your eyes. Keep them shut 
until the second bell rings. Turn your backs 
to the ship and shut your eyes!" howled the 
automaton with alarm and menace. 

"It's frightening!" whispered Veda Kong 
to her companion. Darr Veter calmly took 
from his belt half masks with dark glasses 
rolled up into a tube, put one mask on Veda 
and the other on his own head. He just had 
time to fasten the buckles when a huge, high-
pitched bell rang out, swaying back and forth 
under the roof of the signal tower. 

The ringing stopped and the grasshoppers, 
indifferent to everything, could be plainly 
heard. 

Suddenly the spaceship gave a howl that 
penetrated right to the marrow of a man's 
bones and its lights went out. Once, twice, 
three times, four times the howl swept across 
that dark plain and the more impressionable 
people standing there felt that the ship 
itself was crying with sorrow at the de-
parture. 

The howl broke off as suddenly as it had 
started. A wall of indescribably bright light 
shot up round the ship. Everything else in the 
world ceased to exist for a moment except 
that Cosmic fire. The tower of fire changed to 
a column, stretched out longer and thinner 
until it became a dazzlingly bright line of fire. 

The bell rang for the second time and as the 
people turned round they saw an empty 
plain on which was a huge patch of red-hot 
soil. There was a big star high up in the sky— 
the spaceship Lebed was moving away from 
Earth. 

The people wandered slowly back to the 
electrobuses, looking at the sky and then at 
the place where the ship had taken off, a 
place that had suddenly become as lifeless 
as if the Hammada El Homra had returned, 
the desert that had been the terror of tra-
vellers in days gone by. 

Well-known stars gleamed on the southern 
horizon. All eyes were turned to the point 
where the bright blue star Achernar burned 
in the sky. Lebed would reach that star after a 
journey of eighty-four years at a speed of 
800 million kilometres an hour. For us, on 
Earth, it would be eighty-four years but for 
Lebed it would be forty-seven. Perhaps they 
would find a new world, just as beautiful 
and joyous, in the green rays of the zirconium 
sun. 

Darr Veter and Veda Kong overtook Chara 
Nandi 
and Mven Mass. The African was 
answering the girl's questions. 

"No, it is not sorrow but a great and sad 
pride—such are my 
feelings today. 
Pride 
because we rise ever higher above our planet 
and merge with the Cosmos, sadness because 
our 
beloved Earth is becoming so small. 
Long, long ago the Mayas, the red-skinned 
people of Central America, left behind them 
a proud and sad inscription. I gave it to Erg 

Noor and he'll have it written up in the libra-
ry-laboratory of Lebed." 

The African looked around and noticed 
that his friends who had caught up with them 
were listening, too. He continued in a louder 
voice: 

" Thou who will later show thy face here! 
If thy mind can think thou wilt ask, "Who 
were they?" Ask the dawn, ask the forest, 
ask the waves, ask the storm, ask love. Ask 
the earth, the earth of suffering and the 
earth 
beloved. Who are we? We are the 
Earth!' I too am Earth through and through!" 
added Mven Mass. 

Renn Bose came running up to meet them, 
panting for breath. The friends surrounded 
the physicist who told them in a few words 
the unprecedented news—the first contact 
between two gigantic stellar islands. 

" I hoped to get here before the take-off," 
said Renn Bose, sadly, "to tell Erg Noor 
about it. While he was still on the black plan-
et he realized that the spiral disc had come 
from a far, distant world, a completely alien 
world, and that the strange ship had been 
flying for a long time in the Cosmos." 

"Will Erg Noor never know that the spi-
ral disc has come from such tremendous 
depths of the Universe, that it has come from 
another galaxy, from the 
Andromeda 
Ne-
bula?" asked Veda. "What a pity that he did 
not hear today's reception!" 

"He'll 
hear about it!" said Darr Veter, 
with confidence. "We'll ask the Council to 

sanction power for a special transmission. 
I'll call the spaceship through Satellite 36, 
Lebed will be within range of our transmit-
ters for another nineteen hours!"
