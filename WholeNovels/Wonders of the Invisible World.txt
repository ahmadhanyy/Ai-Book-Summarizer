INTRODUCTION.

[HE two very rare works reprinted in the pre-

sent volume, written by two of the most cele-

brated of the early American divines, relate to

one of the most extraordinary cases of popu-

lar delusion that modern times have witnessed.
It was a

delusion, moreover, to which men of learning and piety lent

themselves, and thus became the means of increasing it.
The scene of this affair was the puritanical colony of New

England, since better known as Massachusetts, the colonists

of which appear to have
carried with them,
in an exag-

gerated form, the superstitious feelings with regard to witch-

craft which then prevailed in the mother country.
In the

spring of 1692 an alarm of witchcraft was raised in the

family of the minister of Salem, and some black servants

were charged with the supposed crime.
Once started, the

alarm
spread
rapidly, and
in a very short time a great

number of people
fell under
suspicion, and many were

thrown into prison on very frivolous grounds, supported, as

such charges usually were, by very unworthy
witnesses.

The
new
governor
of the
colony, Sir William Phipps,

vi
INTRODUCTION.

arrived from England in the middle of May, and he seems

to have been carried away by the excitement, and author-

ized judicial
prosecutions.
The
trials began at the com-

mencement of June
; and the first victim, a woman named

Bridget
Bishop, was hanged.
Governor Phipps,
embar-

rassed by this extraordinary
state of things, called in the

assistance of the clergy of Boston.

There was at this time in Boston a distinguished family

of puritanical ministers of the name of Mather.
Richard

Mather, an English non-conformist divine, had emigrated

to America in 1636, and settled at Dorchester, where, in

1639, he had a son born, who was named, in accordance

with the peculiar nomenclature of the
puritans,
Increase

Mather.
This son distinguished himself much by his ac-

quirements as a scholar and a theologian, became
estab-

lished as a minister in Boston, and in 1685 was elected pre-

sident of Harvard College.
His son, born at Boston in 1 6 6 3,

and called from the name of his mother's family, Cotton

Mather, became more remarkable than
his
father for his

scholarship, gained also a distinguished position in Harvard

College, and was also, at the time ofwhich we are speaking,

a minister of the gospel
in Boston.
Cotton Mather had

adopted
all the most extreme notions of the
puritanical

party with regard to witchcraft, and he had recently had

an opportunity of displaying them.
In the summer of the

year 1688, the children of a mason of Boston named John

Goodwin were suddenly seized with fits and strange afflic-

tions, which were
at once
ascribed to witchcraft, and an

Irish washerwoman named Glover, employed by the family,
WHS
suspected
of being the
witch.
Cotton Mather was

INTRODUCTION.
vii

called in to witness the sufferings of Goodwin's children ;
and he took home with him one of them, a little girl, who

had first displayed these symptoms, in order to examine her

with more
care.
The result was, that the Irish woman

was brought to a
trial, found
guilty,
and hanged
; and

Cotton Mather published next year an account of the case,
under the title of " Late Memorable Providences, relating

to Witchcraft and Possession," which displays a very ex-

traordinary amount of credulity, and an equally great want

of anything like sound judgement.
This work, no doubt,

spread the alarm of witchcraft through the whole colony,
and had some influence on the events which followed.
It

may be supposed that the panic which had now arisen in

Salem was not likely to be appeased by the interference of

Cotton Mather and his father.

The
execution
of the washerwoman, Bridget
Bishop,

had greatly increased the excitement
;
and people
in a

more
respectable
position began to be accused.
On the

19th of July
five more persons were
executed, and
five

more experienced
the same fate on the
1 9th of August.

Among the latter was Mr. George Borroughs, a minister

of the gospel, whose principal crime appears to have been

a disbelief in witchcraft
itself.
His fate excited consider-

able sympathy, which, however, was
checked by
Cotton

Mather, who was
present
at the
place
of execution
on

horseback, and addressed
the crowd, assuring them that

Borroughs was an impostor.
Many people, however, had

now become alarmed at the proceedings of the prosecutors,
and among
those
executed with
Borroughs was a man

named John Willard, who had been employed
to
arrest

viii
INTRODUCTION.

the
persons charged by the accusers, and who had been

accused himself,
because, from
conscientious motives, he

refused to arrest any more.
He attempted to save himself

by
flight;
but he was pursued and
overtaken.
Eight

more
of the
unfortunate victims
of
this
delusion were

hanged on the 22nd of September, making in all nineteen
who had thus suffered, besides one who, in accordance with

the old criminal law practice, had been pressed to death

for refusing to plead.
The excitement had indeed risen

to such a pitch that two dogs accused of witchcraft were

put to death.

A certain degree of reaction, however, appeared to be

taking place, and the magistrates who had conducted the

proceedings began to be alarmed, and to have some doubts

of the wisdom of their proceedings.
Cotton Mather was

called upon by the governor to employ his pen in justifying
what had been done ; and the result was, the book which

stands
first in the present volume, " The Wonders of the

Invisible World;" in which the author gives an account of

seven of the trials
at
Salem, compares the doings of the

witches in New England with those in other parts of the

world, and adds an elaborate dissertation on witchcraft in

general.
This book was published at Boston, Massachu-

setts,
in
the month
of
October, 1692.
Other
circum-

stances, however, contributed
to throw
discredit on
the

proceedings of the court, though the witch mania was at

the same time spreading throughout
the whole
colony.

In
this same month
of
October, the wife of Mr.
Hale,

minister of Beverley, was accused, although no person of

sense and respectability hud the slightest doubt of her in-

INTRODUCTION.
ix

nocence
; and her husband had been a zealous promoter of

the prosecutions.
This accusation brought a new light on

the mind of Mr. Hale, who became convinced of the
in-

justice in which he had been made an accomplice
; but the

other ministers who took the lead in the proceedings were

less willing to believe in their own error ; and equally con-

vinced of the innocence of Mrs. Hale, they raised a ques-

tion of conscience, whether the devil could not assume the

shape of an innocent and pious person, as well as of a wicked

person, for the purpose of afflicting his victims.
The as-

sistance of Increase Mather, the president or principal of

Harvard College, was now called in, and he published the

book which is also reprinted in the present volume
: "A

Further Account of theTryals of the New England Witches.
.... To which is added Cases of Conscience concerning

Witchcrafts and Evil Spirits personating Men."
It will be

seen that the greater part of the " Cases of Conscience" is

given to the discussion of the question just alluded to, which

Increase Mather unhesitatingly decides in the affirmative.
The scene
of agitation was now removed from Salem to

Andover, where a great number of persons were accused

of witchcraft and thrown into prison, until a justice of the

peace named Bradstreet, to whom the accusers applied for

warrants,
refused
to
grant any more.
Hereupon
they

cried out upon Bradstreet, and declared that he had killed

nine persons by means of witchcraft ; and he was so much

alarmed that he fled from the place.
The accusers aimed

at people in higher positions in
society, until at last they

had the audacity
to
cry out upon
the lady
of governor

Phipps himself, and thus lost whatever countenance he had

x
INTRODUCTION.

given to their proceedings out of respect to the two Mathers.

Other people of character, when they were attacked by the

accusers, took energetic measures in self-defence.
A gen-

tleman of Boston, when " cried out upon," obtained a writ

of arrest against
his accusers on a charge of defamation,

and laid the damages at a thousand pounds.
The accusers

themselves now took fright, and many who had made con-

fessions retracted them, while the accusations themselves

fell
into discredit.
. When governor Phipps was recalled

in April, 1693, and left for England, the witchcraft agita-

tion had nearly subsided, and people in general had become

convinced of their error and lamented
it.

But Cotton Mather and his father persisted obstinately

in the opinions they had
published, and looked upon the

reactionary feeling as a triumph of Satan and his kingdom.
In the course of the year they had an opportunity of re-

asserting their belief in the doings of the witches of Salem.
A girl of Boston, named Margaret Rule, was seized with

convulsions, in the course of which she pretended
to see

the
" shapes

"
or spectres of people exactly as they were

alleged to have been seen by the witch-accusers at Salem

and Andover.
This occurred on the
10th of September,

1693
; and she was immediately visited by Cotton Mather,

who examined her, and declared his conviction of the truth

of her
statements.
Had
it depended only upon him, a

new and no doubt
equally bitter persecution
of witches

would have been
raised
in Boston
;
but an
influential

merchant of that town, named Robert Calef, took the mat-

ter up
in a different
spirit, and also examined Margaret

Rule, and satisfied himself that the whole was a delusion or

INTRODUCTION
xi

imposture.
Calef wrote a rational account of the events

of these two years, 1692 and 1693, exposing the delusion,
and controverting the opinions of the two Mathers on the

subject of witchcraft, which was published under the title of
" More Wonders of the Invisible World
;
or the Wonders

of the Invisible world displayed in five parts.
An Account

of the Sufferings
of Margaret Rule
collected by Robert

Calef, merchant of Boston in New England."
The
par-

tisans of the Mathers displayed their hostility to this book

by publicly burning it
; and the Mathers themselves kept

up the
feeling so
strongly that years afterwards, when

Samuel Mather, the son of Cotton, wrote his father's life,
he
says
sneeringly of Calef:
"There was a
certain
dis-

believer in Witchcraft who wrote against this book "

(his

father's 'Wonders of the
Invisible World'),
"but as the

man is dead, his book died long before him."
Calef died

in 1720.

The witchcraft delusion had, however, been sufficiently

dispelled to prevent the recurrence of any other such per-

secutions
; and those who still insisted on their truth were

restrained
to the comparatively harmless publication and

defence
of
their
opinions.
The people of Salem were

humbled and repentant.
They
deserted
their
minister,

Mr.
Paris, with whom
the
persecution had begun, and

were not satisfied until they had driven him away from the

place.
Their remorse continued
through
several
years,

and most of the people concerned in the judicial proceed-

ings proclaimed
their regret.
The jurors signed a paper

expressing
their repentance, and pleading that they had

laboured under a delusion.
What ought to have been con-

xii
INTRODUCTION.

sidered still more conclusive, many of those who had con-

fessed themselves witches, and had been instrumental in

accusing others, retracted all they had said, and confessed

that they had acted under the influence of terror.
Yet the

vanity of superior intelligence and knowledge was so great

in the two Mathers that they resisted all conviction.
In his

Magnalia, an ecclesiastical history of New England, pub-

lished in 1 700, Cotton Mather repeats his original view of the

doings of Satan in Salem, showing no regret for the part
he had taken
in
this
affair, and making no retraction of

any of his opinions.
Still later, in 1723, he repeats them

again in the same strain in the chapter of the
" Reinark-

ables " of his father entitled
" Troubles from the Invisible

World."
His
father, Increase Mather, had died
in that

same year at an advanced
age, being
in
his
eighty-fifth

year.
Cotton Mather died on the 13th of February, 1728.

Whatever we may think of the credulity of these two

ecclesiastics, there can be no ground
for charging them

with acting otherwise than conscientiously, and they had

claims on the gratitude of their countrymen sufficient to

overbalance
their
error
of judgment
on
this
occasion.

Their books relating to the terrible witchcraft delusion at

Salem have now become very rare
in
the
original
edi-

tions, and their interest, as remarkable monuments of the

history of superstition, makes them well worthy of a reprint.

The First Case proposed, Whether or not may Satan appear

in the Shape of an Innocent and Pious, as well as of a
Nocent and Wicked Person, to afflict such as suffer by
Diabolical Molestation ?
225

The Affirmative proved from Six Arguments
:

1. From Several Scriptures
225

2. Because it is possible for the Devil, in the Shape of

Innocent Persons, to do other Mischiefs, proved by
many Instances
234

3. Because if Satan may not represent an Innocent Per-

son as afflicting others, it must be either because he
wants will or power to do this, or because God will
never permit him so to do it
;
either of which may

be affirmed

The Second Case considered, viz., If one bewitched be cast

down with the look or cast of the Eye of another Per-

son, and after that recovered again by a Touch from

the. same Person, is not this an infallible Proof that the

party accused and complained of is in Covenant with
the Devil ?
255

A rwiwer.This maybe Ground of Suspicion and Examination,

but not of Conviction
255

The Judgment of Mr. Bernard and of Dr. Cotta produced
256

Several Things
offered against the
Infallibility of
this

Proof :--

1.
"Pis possible that the Persons in question may be pos-

sessed with Evil Spirits.
Signs of such....
258

2. Falling down with the Cast of the Eye proceeds not

from a natural, but an arbitrary Cause ....
260

3. .That of the bewitched Persons being recovered with

a Touch is various and fallible
262

4. There are that question the Lawfulness of the Ex-

periment
264

5. The Testimony of Bewitched 6r Possessed Persons

is no Evidence
as to what they
see concerning

others, and therefore not as to themselves

266

6. Bewitched
Persons
have
sometimes
been
struck

down with the Look of Dogs ...'...
267

7.
If this were an Infallible Proof, there would be dif-

ficulty in discovering Witches
268

8. Nothing can be produced out of the Word of God

to shew, that this is any Proof of Witchcraft

coveries of Witchcraft, which Jurors and Judges may

and Condemnation of the Persons under Suspicion ?

THE AUTHOR'S DEFENCE.

[IS,
as
I remember, the Learned Scribonius,

who reports, That one of his Acquaintance,

devoutly making his Prayers on the
behalf

of a Person molested by Evil
Spirits,
re-

ceived from those JSvil Spirits an horrible Blow over the

Face
: And I may my self expect not few or small Buffet-

ings from Evil Spirits, for the Endeavours wherewith I am
now going to encounter them.
I am far from insensible,

that at this extraordinary Time of the Devils coming down

in great Wrath upon
us,
there
are too many Tongues

and Hearts thereby set on fire of Hell; that the various

Opinions about the Witchcrafts which of later time have

troubled us, are maintained by some with so much cloudy

Fury, as if they could never be sufficiently stated, unless

written in the Liquor wherewith Witches use to write their

Covenants
; and that he who becomes an Author at such

a time, had need be fenced with Iron, and the Staff of a

Spear.
The unaccountable
Frowardness, Asperity, Un-

treatableness, and Inconsistency of many Persons, every

that Story, There met him two possessed with Devils, ex-

ceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
To send abroad a Book, among such Readers, were a very
unadvised thing,
if a Man had not such Reasons to give,

as I can bring, for such an Undertaking.
Briefly, I hope

it cannot be said, They are all so: No, I hope the Body

of this People, are yet in such a Temper, as to be capable

of applying their Thoughts, to make a Right Use of the

stupendous
and
prodigious
Things
that
are
happening

among us
: And because I was concerned, when I saw that

no abler Hand emitted any Essays to engage the Minds of

this People, in such holy, pious, fruitful Improvements, as
God would have to be made of his amazing Dispensations
now upon
us.
THEREFORE
it
is, that One of the Least

among the Children of New-England, has here done, what

is done.
None, but the Father, ivho sees in secret, knows

the Heart-breaking Exercises, wherewith I have composed
what is now going to be exposed, lest I should in any one

thing miss of doing my designed Service for his Glory, and

for
his
People
;
but
I am now somewhat
comfortably

assured of his favourable acceptance; and, I will not fear;
what can a Satan do unto me/

Having performed something of what God required, in

labouring to suit his Words unto his Works, at this Day
among us, and therewithal handled a Theme that has been

sometimes counted not unworthy the Pen, even of a King,

it will easily be perceived, that some subordinate Ends have

been considered in these Endeavours.

I have indeed set myself to countermine the whole PLOT

of the Devil, against New-England, in every branch of it,

as far as one of my darkness, can comprehend such a Work

of Darkness.
I may add, that I have herein also aimed

at the Information and Satisfaction of Good Men in another

Country, a thousand Leagues
off, where I have,
it may

be, more, or however, more considerable Friends, than
in

my own
: And I do what I can to have that Country, now,

as well as always, in the best Terms with my own.
But

while I am doing these things, I have been driven a little

to do something likewise
for myself;
I mean, by taking

off the false Reports, and hard Censures about my Opinion

in these Matters, the Farter's Portions which my pursuit

of Peace has procured me among the Keen.
My hitherto

unvaried Thoughts are here published
; and I believe, they

will be owned by most of the Ministers of God in these

Colonies; nor can amends be well made me, for the wrong
done me, by other sorts of Representations.

In
fine:
For the Dogmatical part of my Discourse,
I

want no Defence; for the Historical part of
it, I have a

very
Great
One;
the
Lieutenant-Governour
of
Neiv-

England having perused
it, has done me the Honour of

giving me a Shield, under the Umbrage whereof I now

dare to walk abroad.

REVEREND AND DEAR SIR,

OU very much gratify'd me, as well as put

a kind ^Respect upon me, when you put into
my hands your elaborate and most season-

able
Discourse,
entituled, The Wonders
of

the Invisible World.
And having now perused so fruit-

ful and happy a Composure, upon such a Subject, at this

Juncture of Time ; and considering the place that I hold

in the Court of Oyer and Terminer,
still labouring and

proceeding in the Trial of the Persons accused and con-

victed for
Witchcraft, I find that I am more nearly and

highly concerned than as a meer ordinary Reader, to ex-

press my Obligation and Thankfulness to youfor so great
Pains ;
and, cannot but hold myself many ways bound,

even to the utmost of what is properfor me, in my present

publick
Capacity,
to
declare my
singular Approbation

thereof.
Such
is your Design, most plainly
expressed

throughout
the
whole;
such your Zeal for God, your

Enmity to Satan and his Kingdom, your Faithfulness and

Compassion to this poor People; such the Vigour, but yet

great Tempe.r of your Spirit; such your Instruction and

Counsel, your Care of Truth, your Wisdom and, Dexterity
in allaying and moderating that among us, which needs

it ; such your clear discerning of Divine Providences and

Periods, now running on apace towards their Glorious

Issues in the World ; and finally, such your good News

of The Shortness of the Devil's Time, that all Good Men

must
needs
desire,
the making of this your Discourse

publick to the World ; and will greatly rejoyce, that the

Spirit of the Lord has thus enabled you to lift up a Stan-

dard against the Infernal Enemy, that hath been coming

in like a Flood upon us.
/ do therefore make it my par-

ticular and earnest Request unto you, that as soon as may

be, you will commit the same unto the Press accordingly.
I am,

Your assured Friend,

of Souldiers,

People ; and there is not Seven of them all, but what loves

Mr. Wilson.
That gracious Man presently and pleasantly

reply'd: Sir, I'll tell you as good a thing as that; here is

a mighty Body of People, and there
is not
so much as

all, but Mr. Wilson
loves him.

there may be few that love the Writer of this Book ; but

give me leave to boast so far, there is not one among
all

this Body of People, whom this Mather would not study to

serve, as well as to love.
With such a Spirit of Love,
is

the Book now before us written
: I appeal to all this World;

and if this World will deny me the Eight of acknowledging

so much, I appeal to the other, that it is not written with
an Evil Spirit: for which cause I shall not wonder, if Evil

Spirits be exasperated by what is written, as the Sadduces

doubtless were with what was discoursed in the Days of our

Saviour.
I only demand the Justice, that others read it,

with the same Spirit wherewith I writ
it.

ENCHANTMENTS ENCOUNTEKED.

SECTION I.

[T was as long ago, as the Year 1637, that a

Faithful Minister of the Church of England,
whose Name was Mr. Edward Symons, did

in a Sermon afterwards Printed, thus express

himself ;

* At New-England now the Sun of Comfort be-

'

gins
to
appear, and the
glorious Day-Star
to show
it-

'

self;
Sed Venient Annis Sceculce Seris, there will come

' Times in
after Ages, when the Clouds will over-shadow

' and darken the Sky there.
Many now promise to them-

1 selves nothing but successive Happiness there, which for

' a time through God's Mercy they may enjoy
; and I pray

{ God, they may a long time
;
but
in this World there is

' no Happiness
perpetual.'
An
Observation,
or
I
had

almost said, an Inspiration, very dismally now verify 'd upon
us
!
It has been
affirm'd by some who best knew New-

England, That the World
will do New-England a great

piece of Injustice,
if it acknowledge not a measure of Re-

ligion, Loyalty, Honesty, and Industry, in the People there,

10
ENCHANTMENTS

beyond what is to be found with any other People for the
Number of them.
When I did a few years ago, publish a

Book,
which
mentioned
a few memorable
Witchcrafts,

committed
in
this country
;
the excellent Baxter, graced

the Second Edition
of that
Book, with a kind
Preface,

wherein he
sees
cause
to
say, If any are Scandalized,

tJutt New-England, a place of as serious Piety, as any I

can hear of, under Heaven, should be troubled so much with

Witches ; I think,
'tis no wonder :
Where vjill the Devil

shoio most Malice, but where he is hated, and hateth most :
And I hope, the Country will still deserve and answer the

Charity so expressed by that Reverend Man of God.
Who-

soever travels over this Wilderness, will see
it richly be-

spangled with
Evangelical
Churches, whose
Pastors
are

holy,
able, and
painful Overseers of their
Flocks, lively

Preachers, and vertuous Livers; and such as in their several

Neighbourly Associations, have had their Meetings whereat

Ecclesiastical Matters
of common Concernment are con-

sidered
: Churches, whose Communicants have been seriously

examined about their Experiences of Regeneration, as well

as about their Knowledge, and Belief, and blameless Con-

versation, before their admission to the Sacred Communion ;

although others of less but hopeful Attainments in Chris-

tianity are not
ordinarily deny'd Baptism for themselves

and theirs
;
Churches, which are shye of using any thing

in the Worship of God, for which they cannot see a Warrant

of God ; but with whom yet the Names of Congregational,

Presbyterian, Episcopalian, or Antipoedobaptist, are swal-

lowed up in that of Christian ; Persons of all those Per-

swasions being taken
into our
Fellowship, when
visible

ENCOUNTERED.
11

Goodliness
has
recommended
them
:
Churches,
which

usually do within themselves manage their own Discipline,
under the Conduct of their Elders
; but yet call in the help

of Synods upon Emergencies, or Aggrievances
:
Churches,

Lastly, wherein Multitudes are growing ripe for Heaven

every day ; and as fast as these are taken
off, others are

daily rising up.
And by the Presence and Power of the

Divine Institutions thus maintained in the Country.
We

are still so happy, that I suppose there
is no Land in the

Universe more free from the debauching, and the debasing

Vices
of
Ungodliness.
The
Body
of
the
People
are

hitherto
so
disposed,
that
Swearing,
Sabbath-breaking,

Whoring, Drunkenness, and the like, do not make a Gentle-

man, but a Monster, or a Goblin, in the vulgar Estimation.

All this notwithstanding, we must humbly confess to our

God, that we are miserably degenerated from the first Love

of our Predecessors ; however we boast our selves a little,
when Men would go to trample upon us, and we venture

to say, Wherein soever any is bold (we speak foolishly) ive

are bold also.
The first Planters of these Colonies were

a chosen Generation of Men, who were first so pure, as to

disrelish many things which they thought wanted Refor-

mation elsewhere
; and yet withal so peaceable, that they

embraced a voluntary Exile in a squalid, horrid, American

Desart, rather than to live in Contentions with their Brethren.

Those good Men imagined that they should
leave
their

Posterity in a place, where they should never see the Inroads

of Profanity,
or
Superstition
: And a famous Person
re-

turning hence, could
in a Sermon before the Parliament,

profess, / have noiv been seven Years in a Country, ivhere

12
ENCHANTMENTS

I never saiv one Man drunk, or heard one Oath sworn, or

beheld one Beggar in the Streets all the while.
Such great

Persons as Budceus, and others, who mistook Sir Thomas

Moor's UTOPIA, for a Country really existent, and
stirr'd

up some Divines charitably to undertake a Voyage thither,

might now have certainly found a Truth in their Mistake ;
New- England was a true Utopia.
But, alas, the Children

and Servants of those old Planters must needs afford many,

degenerate Plants, and there is now risen up a Number of

People,
otherwise
inclined
than
our
Joshua's, and
the

Elders
that
out-liv'd them.
Those two things our holy

Progenitors, and our happy Advantages make Omissions

of Duty, and such Spiritual Disorders as the whole World

abroad
is overwhelmed with, to be as provoking in us, as

the most flagitious Wickednesses committed in other places ;
and the Ministers of God are accordingly severe in their

Testimonies
: But in short, those Interests of the Gospel,

which were the Errand of our Fathers into these Ends of

the Earth, have been too much neglected and postponed,
and the Attainments of an handsome Education, have been

too much undervalued, by Multitudes that have not fallen

into Exorbitances of Wickedness ; and some, especially of

our young Ones, when they have got abroad from under

the Restraints here laid upon them, have become extrava-

gantly
and abominably
Vicious.
Hence
'tis,
that the

Happiness of New-England has been but for a time, as it

was foretold, and not for a long time, as has been desir'd

for
us.
A Variety
of Calamity has long
follow'd
this

Plantation
; and we have
all the Reason imaginable
to

ascribe
it unto the Rebuke
of Heaven upon us
for our

ENCOUNTERED.
13

manifold Apostasies; we make no right use of our Disasters
:

If we do not, Remember whence we are fallen, and repent,
and do the first works.
But yet our Afflictions may come

under a further Consideration with us
: There is a further

Cause of our Afflictions, whose due must be given him.

II. The New-Englanders are a People of God settled

in
those, which were once the Devil's Territories ; and
it

may easily be supposed
that the Devil was exceedingly

disturbed, when he perceived such a People here accom-

plishing the Promise of old made unto our Blessed Jesus,
That He should have the Utmostparts of the Earthfor his

Possession.
There was not a greater Uproar among the

Ephesians, when the Gospel was first brought among them,
than there was among, The Powers of the Air (after whom

those Ephesians walked) when first the Silver Trumpets

of the Gospel here made the Joyful Sound.
The Devil

thus
Irritated, immediately try'd
all sorts of Methods to

overturn this poor Plantation
: and so much of the Church,

as was Fled into this Wilderness, immediately found, The

Serpent cast out of his Mouth a Flood for the carrying of

it away.
I believe, that never were more Satanical De-

vices used for the Unsetling of any People under the Sun,
than what have been Employ'd for the Extirpation of the

Vine which God has here Planted, Casting out the Heathen,
and preparing a Room before it, and causing it
to
take,

deep Root, and fill the Land, so that
it sent
its Boughs

unto the Atlantic Sea Eastward, and its Branches unto the

Connecticut River Westward, and the Hills were covered

with the shadow thereof.
But, All those Attempts of Hell,

14
ENCHANTMENTS

have
hitherto been Abortive, many an Ebenezer has been

Erected unto the Praise of God, by his Poor People here ;

and, Having obtained Help from, God, we continue to this

Day.
Wherefore the Devil
is now making one Attempt

more upon us ; an Attempt more Difficult, more Surprizing,
more
snarl'd with
unintelligible Circumstances than any

that we have hitherto Encoimtred ; an Attempt so Critical,

that ifwe get well through, we shall soon enjoy HalcyonDays
with all the Vultures of Hell Trodden under our Feet.
He

has wanted his Incarnate Legions to Persecute us, as the

People of God have in the other Hemisphere been Perse-

cuted
: he has therefore drawn forth
his more Spiritual

ones to make an Attacque upon us.
We have been advised

by some Credible Christians yet
alive, that a Malefactor,

accused of Witchcraft as well as Murder, and Executed in

this place more than Forty Years ago, did then give Notice

of, An Horrible PLOT against the Country byWITCHCRAFT,
and a Foundation of WITCHCKAFT then laid, which if it

were not seasonably discovered, would probably Blow up,
andpufl doivn all the Churches in the Country.
And we

have now with Horror seen the Discovery of such a Witch-

craft!
An Army of Devils is horribly broke in upon the

place which is the Center, and after a sort, the First-lorn

of our English Settlements
: and the Houses of the Good

People
there
are
fill'd with
the
doleful Shrieks of their

Children and
Servants, Tormented by
Invisible Hands,

with Tortures altogether preternatural.
After the Mischiefs

there
Endeavoured,
and
since
in
part
Conquered,
the

terrible Plague, of Evil Angels, hath made its Progress into

some other places, where other Persons have been
in like

ENCOUNTERED.
15

tnanner
Diabolically handled.
These our poor
Afflicted

Neighbours, quickly after they become Infected and In-

fested with these Daemons, arrive to a Capacity of Discern-

ing those which they conceive iheShapes of their Troublers ;
and notwithstanding the Great and Just
Suspicion, that

the Dcemons might Impose the Shapes of Innocent Persons

in their Spectral Exhibitions upon the
Sufferers, (which

may perhaps prove no small part of the Witch-Plot in the

issue) yet many of the Persons thus Represented, being

Examined, several of them have been Convicted of a very
Damnable Witchcraft :
yea, more than One Tiventy have

Confessed, that they have Signed unto a Book, which the

Devil show'd them, and Engaged in his Hellish Design of

Bewitching, and Ruining our Land.
We know
not, at

least / know not, how far the Delusions of Satan may be

Interwoven into some Circumstances of the Confessions ;
but
one would
think,
all
the Rules
of Understanding

Humane Affairs are at an end,
if after so many most Vol-

untary
Harmonious
Confessions,
made
by
Intelligent

Persons of all Ages, in sundry Towns, at several Times,
we must not Believe the main strokes wherein those Con-

fessions
all agree

:
especially when we have a thousand

preternatural Things every day before our eyes, wherein the

Confessors do acknowledge their Concernment, and give
Demonstration of their being so Concerned.
If the Devils

now can strike the minds of men with any Poisons of so

fine a Composition and Operation, that Scores of Innocent

People
shall Unite, in Confessions of a Crime, which we

see actually committed, it is a thing prodigious, beyond the

Wonders of the former Ages, and
it threatens no less than

16
ENCHANTMENTS

a sort of a Dissolution upon the World.
Now, by these

Confessions 'tis Agreed, That the Devil has made a dread-

ful Knot of Witches in the Country, and by the help
of

Witches has dreadfully increased that Knot
: That these

Witches have driven a Trade of Commissioning their Con-

federate Spirits, to do all sorts ofMischiefs to the Neighbours,

whereupon
there
have
ensued
such
Mischievous
conse-

quences upon the Bodies and Estates of the Neighbourhood,

as could not otherwise be accounted
for
:
yea, That
at

prodigious Witch-Meetings, the Wretches have proceeded

ao far, as to Concert and Consult the Methods of Rooting
out the Christian Religion from this Country, and setting

up instead of it, perhaps a more gross Diabolism, than ever

the World saw before.
And yet it will be a thing little short

of Miracle, if in so spread a Business as this, the Devil

should not get
in some of his Juggles, to confound the

Discovery of all the rest.

III.
Doubtless, the Thoughts of many will receive a

great Scandal against New-England, from the Number of

Persons that have been Accused, or Suspected, for Witch-

craft, in
this Country
:
But
it were
easie to offer many

things, that may Answer and Abate the Scandal.
If the

Holy God should any where permit the Devils to hook two

or
three wicked Scholars
into Witchcraft, and then by

theirAssistance to Range with theirPoisonous Insinuations

among Ignorant, Envious, Discontented People,
till they

have
cunningly
decoy'd
them
into
some
sudden
Act,

whereby the Toyls of Hell shall be perhaps inextricably cast

over them
:
what Country in the World would not afford

ENCOUNTERED,
17

Witches, numerous to a Prodigy 1
Accordingly, The King-

doms of Sweden, Denmark, Scotland, yea and England it

self, as well
as the Province
of New-England, have had

their Storms of Witchcrafts breaking upon them, which

have made most Lamentable Devastations
: which
also I

wish, may be The
Last.
And
it
is not uneasie
to be

imagined, That God has not brought out all the Witchcrafts

in many
other Lands with such a speedy, dreadful, de-

stroying Jealousie, as burns forth upon such High Treasons,
committed here in A Land of Uprightness :
Transgressors

may more quickly here than elsewhere become a Prey to the

Vengeance of Him, Who has Eyes like a Flame of Fire,

and, u'ho walks in the midst of the Golden Candlesticks.

Moreover, There are many parts of the World, who if they
do upon this Occasion insult over this People of God, need

only to be told the Story of what happened at Loim, in the

Dutchy of Gulic, where a Popish Curate having ineffectu-

ally try'd many Charms to Eject the Devil out of a Damsel

there possessed, he passionately bid the Devil come out of

her into himself; but the Devil answered him, Quidmihi

Opus, est eum tentare, quem Novissimo die, Jure Optimo,
sum possessurus ? That
is, What need I meddle with one

whom I am sure to have, and hold at the Last-day as my
own for ever !

But
besides
all
this,
give me leave to add,
it
is to be

hoped, That among the Persons represented by the Spectres
which now afflict our Neighbours, there will be found some

that never explicitly contracted with any of the Evil Angels.
The Witches have not only intimated, but some of them

acknowledge, That they have plotted the Representations

18
ENCHANTMENTS

of Innocent Persons, to cover and shelter themselves
in

their Witchcrafts
; now, altho' our good God has hitherto

generally preserved us from the Abuse therein design'd by
the Devils for us, yet who of us can exactly state, Howfar
our God may for our CJtastisement permit the Devil to

proceed in suchan Abuse?
It was the Result of a Discourse,

lately held at a Meeting of some very Pious and Learned

Ministers among us, That the Devils may sometimes have

apermission to Represent an Innocent Person, as Torment^

ing such as are under Diabolical Molestations : But that

such things are Rare and Extraordinary;
especially ivhen

such matters come before Civil Judicature.
The Opinion

expressed with so much Caution and Judgment, seems to

be the
prevailing
Sense
of many
others, who
are men

Eminently Cautious and Judicious
; and have both Argu-

ment and History to Countenance them in
it.
It is Rare

and Extraordinary, for an Honest Naboth
to have
his

Life it self Sworn away by two Children of Belial, and yet
no Infringement hereby made on theRectoral Righteousness

of our Eternal Soveraign, whose Judgments are a Great

Deep, and who gives none Account of His matters.
Thus,

although the Appearance of Innocent Persons in Spectral
Exhibitions afflicting the Neighbour-hood, be a thing Rare
and Extraordinary ; yet who can be sure, that the great
Bdialtf Hell must needs be always Yoked up from this piece

of Mischief 1
The best man that ever lived has been called a

Witch:
and why may not
this
too
usual and unhappy

Symptom
of A
Witch,
even a
Spectral
Representation,

befall a person that shall be none of the worst ?
Is it not

possible 1
The Laplanders will
tell us
'tis possible

:
for

ENCOUNTERED.
19

Persons to be unwittingly attended with officious Damons,

bequeathed unto them, and impos'd upon them, by Relations

that have been Witches.
Qucery, also, Whether at a Time,

when the Devil with his Witches are engag'd
in a War

upon a people, some certain steps of ours, in such a War,
may not be followed with our appearing so and so
for a

while among them in the Visions of our afflicted Forloms/

And, Who can
certainly say, what other Degrees or Me-

thods of sinning, besides that of a Diabolical Compact, may

give the Devils advantage
to
act
in the Shape of them

that have
miscarried ?
Besides what may happen
for a

while, to try the Patience of the Vertuous.
May not some

that have been ready upon feeble grounds uncharitably to

Censure and Reproach
other
people, be punished
for
it

by Spectres
for a while exposing them to Censure and

Reproach 1
And furthermore, I pray, that it may be con-

sidered, Whether a World of Magical Tricks
often used

in
the World, may not
insensibly oblige Devils
to wait

upon the Superstitious Users of them.
A Witty Writer

against Sadducism
has
this
Observation, That persons

who
never
made
any express
Contract with
Apostate

Spirits, yet may Act strange Things by Diabolick Aids

which they procure by the
use
of those wicked Forms

and
Arts,
that the Devil
first imparted unto
his Con-

federates.
And he
adds, We knew not but the Laivs of

tlie. Dark Kingdom may Enjoyn a particular Attendance

upon all those that practice their Mysteries, whether they

knoiv them to be theirs or no.
Some of them that have

been cry'd out upon a imploying Evil Spirits to hurt our

Land, have been known to be most WoodyFortwu-Tfllert;

20
ENCHANTMENTS

and some of them have
confessed, That when they told

Fortunes, they would pretend the Rules
of Chiromancy

and the like Ignorant Sciences, but indeed they had no

Rule (they said) but
this, The things
ivere
then Darted

into their minds.
Darted !
Ye Wretches
; By whom, I

pray ?
Surely by none but the Devils ; who, tho' perhaps

they did not exactly Foreknow all the thus Predicted Con-

tingencies
; yet having once Foretold them,
they stood

bound in Honour now to use their Interest, which alas, in

This World, is very great, for the Accomplishment of their
own Predictions.
There are others, that have used most

wicked Sorceries to gratifie their unlawful Curiosities, or to

prevent
Inconveniences
in Man
and
Beast
;
Sorceries,

which I will not Name, lest
I should by Naming, Teach

them.
Now, some
Devil
is evermore
invited
into
the

Service of the Person that shall Practice these Witchcrafts;
and if they have gone on Impenitently in these Communions

with any Devil, the Devil may perhaps become at last a

Familiar to them, and so assume their Livery, that they
cannot shake him
off in any way, but that One, which I

would most heartily prescribe unto them, Namely, That of

a deep and long Repentance.
Should these Impieties have

been committed in such a place as New-England, for my

part I should not wonder, if when Devils are Exposing the

Grosser Witches among us, God permit them to bring in

these Lesser ones with the rest for their perpetual Humili-

ation.
In the Issue therefore, may it not be found, that

New-England is not so stock'd with Rattle Snakes, as was

imagined.

IV.
But I do not believe, that the progress of Witch-

ENCOUNTERED.
21

craft amongus, is all the Plot which the Devil is managing in

the Witelwraft now upon us.
It is judged, That the Devil

rais'd the Storm, whereof we read
in the Eighth Chapter

of Matthew, on purpose to over-set the little Vessel wherein

the
Disciples
of Our Lord were Embarqued with Him.

,And it may be fear'd, that in the Horrible Tempest which

is now upon ourselves, the design of the Devil is to sink that

Happy Settlement of Government, wherewith Almighty God

has graciously enclined Their Majesties to favour us.
We

are blessed with a GOVERNOUR, than whom no man can

be more willing to serve Their Majesties, or this their Pro-

vince
:
He is continually venturing his All to do
it
: and

were not the Interests of his Prince dearer to him than his

own, he could not but soon be weary of the Helm, whereat

he sits.
We are under the Influence of a LIEUTENANT

GOVERNOUR, who not only by being admirably accomplished
both with Natural and Acquired Endowments, is fitted for

the Service of Their Majesties, but also with an unspotted

Fidelity applies himself to that Service.
Our COUNCEL-

LOURS
are some
of our most Eminent
Persons,
and
as

Loyal
Subjects
to
the Crown, as hearty
lovers
of their

Country.
Our Constitution also is attended with singular

Priviledges ; All which Things are by the Devil exceedingly

Envy'd unto us.
And the Devil will doubtless take this occa-

sion for the raising of such complaints and clamours, as may

be of pernicious consequence unto some part of our present

Settlement, if he can so far Impose.
But that which most

of
all Threatens us, in our present Circumstances,
is the

Misunderstanding, and so the Animosity, whereinto the

Witchcraft now Raging, has Enchanted
us.
The Em-

22
ENCHANTMENTS

broiling,
first, of our Spirits, and then of our A/airs,
is

evidently as considerable a Branch of the Hellish Intrigue
which now vexes us as any one Thing whatsoever.
The

Devil has made us like a Troubled Sea, and the Mire and
Mud begins now also to heave up apace.
Even Good and

Wise Men suffer themselves to fall into their Paroxysms ;
and the Shake which the Devil
is now giving us, fetches

up the Dirt which before lay still at the bottom of our

sinful Hearts.
Ifwe allow the Mad Dogs of Hell to poyson

us by biting us, we shall imagine that we see nothing but

such things about us, and like such things fly upon all that
we see.
Were
it not for what
is IN
us, for my part, I

should not fear a thousand Legions of Devils
:
'tis by our

Quarrels that we
spoil our Prayers ; and
if our humble,

zealous, and united Prayers are once hindred
:
Alas, the

Philistines, of Hell have cut our Locks for us
; they will

then blind us, mock us, ruine us
: In truth, I cannot alto-

gether blame
it,
if People are a little
transported, when

they conceive
all the secular Interests of themselves and

their Families at the Stake
; and yet at the sight of these

Heartburnings, I cannot forbear
the Exclamation of the

Sweet-spirited ^4 ws^m, in his Pacificatory Epistle to Jerom,
on the Contest with Ruffin,
misera& miser-anda Conditio !

Condition, truly miserable
!
But what shall be done to

cure these Distractions ?
It is wonderfully necessary, that

some healing Attempts be made at this time
: And I must

needs confess (if I may speak so much) like a Nazianzen,

1 am so desirous of a share in them, that
if, being thrown

overboard, were needful to allay the Storm, I should think

Dying a Trifle to be undergone, for so great a Blessedness.

ENCOUNTERED.
23

V.
I would most importunately
in
the
first
place,

entreat every Man to maintain an holy Jealousie over his

Soul at this time, and think ; May not the Devil make me,

though ignorantly and umvillingly,
to be an Instrument

of doing something that he would have to be done ?
For

my
part,
I
freely own my
Suspicion, lest something of

Enchantment, have reach'd more Persons and Spirits among

us, than we
are
well aware
of.
But
then,
let us more

generally agree to maintain a kind Opinion one of another.

That Charity without which, even our giving our Bodies to

be burned would
profit nothing, uses
to proceed by this

Rule
;
It is kind, it is not easily provok'd, it thinks no Evil,

it believes all things, hopes all things.
But if we disregard

this Rule of Charity, we shall indeed give our Body Poli-

tick to be burned.
I have heard
it affirmed, That in the

late great Flood upon Connecticut, those Creatures which

could not but have quarrelled at another time, yet now being

driven together, very agreeably stood by one another.
I

am sure we shall be worse than Brutes if we fly upon one

another at a time when the Floods of Belial make us afraid.
On
the one
side;
[Alas, my Pen, must thou write the

word, Side in the Business ?]
There are very worthy Men,

who having been
call'd by God, when and
where
this

Witchcraft first appeared upon the Stage to encounter
it,

are earnestly desirous to have
it sifted unto the bottom of

it.
And I pray, which of us all that should live under the

continual Impressions of the Tortures, Outcries, and Ha-

vocks which Devils confessedly Commissioned by Witches
make among their distressed Neighbours, would not have

a Biass that way beyond other Men 1
Persons this way

24
tiNCHA NTMENTS

disposed have been Men eminent for Wisdom and Vertue,
and Men acted by a noble Principle of Conscience
: Had

not
Conscience
(of duty to God)
prevailed above other

Considerations with them, they would not for all they are

worth in the World have medled in this Thorny business.
Have there been any disputed Methods used in discovering

the Works of Darkness ?
It may be none but what have

had great Presedents in other parts of the World
; which

may, though not altogether
justifie, yet much alleviate a

Mistake in us if there should happen to be found any such

mistake in so dark a Matter.
They have done what they

have done, with multiplied Addresses to God for his Guidance,
and have not been insensible how much they have exposed
themselves
in what they have done.
Yea,
they would

gladly contrive and receive an expedient, how the shedding

of Blood, might be spared, by the Recovery of Witches,

not gone beyond the
Reach of Pardon.
And
after
all,

they invite
all good Men, in Terms to this purpose, 'Be-

* ing amazed at the Number and Quality of those accused

1 of late, we do not know but Satan by his Wiles may have

' enwrapped some innocent Persons ; and therefore should

'earnestly and humbly
desire the most Critical Enquiry

'upon the place, to find out the Falacy;
that there may

' be none of the Servants of the Lord, with the Worshippers

' of Baal.'
I may also add, That whereas, if once a Witch

do ingeniously confess among us, no more Spectres do in

their Shapes after this, trouble the Vicinage ; if any guilty

Creatures will accordingly to so good purpose confess their

Crime to any Minister of God, and get out of the Snare

of the Devil, as no Minister will discover such a Conscien-

ENCOUNTERED.
25

tious
Confession, so I believe none in the Authority will

press him to discover it
; but rejoyc'd in a Soul sav'd from

Death.
On the other side [if I must again use the word

Side, which yet I hope to live to blot out] there are very

worthy Men, who are not a little
dissatisfied at the Pro-

ceedings in the Prosecution of this Witchcraft.
And why?

Not because they would have any such abominable thing,
defended
from
the
Strokes
of Impartial
Justice.
No,

those Reverend Persons who gave in this Advice unto the

Honourable
Council
;

' That
Presumptions,
whereupon

* Persons may be Committed, and much more Convictions,

' whereupon
Persons may
be
Condemned,
as
guilty
of

*

Witchcrafts, ought certainly to be more considerable, thun

'

barely the Accused Persons being represented by a Spectre

1 unto
the
Afflicted
;
Nor
are
Alterations made
in the

'

Sufferers,
by
a Look
or Touch
of the
Accused, to be

'esteemed an infallible Evidence of Guilt;
but frequently

'liable to be abused by the Devils Legerdemains'

: I say,

those very Men of God most conscientiously Subjoined this

Article
to that Advice,

* Nevertheless we cannot but

' humbly recommend unto the Government, the speedy and

'vigorous
Prosecution
of such
as
have
rendred
thein-

' selves Obnoxious; according to the best Directions given

' in the Laws of God, and the wholsome Statutes of the

' English Nation for the Detection of Witchcraft.'
Only

'tis a most commendable Cautiousness,
in those gracious

Men,
to be very shye lest the Devil get so far into our

Faith, as that for the sake of many Truths which we find

he tells us, we come at length to believe any Lyes, where-

with he may abuse us: whereupon, what a Desolation of

26
ENCHANTMENTS

Names would soon ensue, besides a thousand other pernicious

Consequences? and lest there should be any such Principles
taken up,
as when
put
into
Practice must
unavoidably

cause the Righteous to perish with the Wicked; or procure
the Bloodshed of any Persons, like the Gibeonites, whom

some learned Men suppose
to be under a false Notion of

Witches, by Saul exterminated.

They would have all due steps taken for the Extinction

of Witches
; but they would fain have them to be sure ones ;

nor is it from any thing, but the real and hearty goodness

of such Men, that they are loth to surmise
ill of other Men,

till there be the fullest Evidence for the surmises.
As for

the Honourable Judges
that have been
hitherto
in the

Commission, they are above my Consideration: wherefore

I will only say thus much of them, That such of them as

I have the Honour of a Personal Acquaintance with, are
Men of an excellent Spirit ; and as at first they went about

the work for which they were Commission'd, with a very

great aversion, so they have still been under Heart-breaking

Sollicitudes, how they might therein best serve both God

and Man.
In
fine, Have there been
faults on any
side

fallen into?
Surely, they have at worst been but the faults

of a well-meaning Ignorance.
On
every
side then, why

should not we endeavour with amicable Correspondencies,

to help one another out of the Snares wherein the Devil

would involve us? To wrangle the Devil out of the Country,

will be truly a New Experiment

: Alas
! we are not aware

of the Devil, if we do not think, that he aims at inflaming
us one against another; and shall we suffer our selves to be

Devil-ridden ?
or by any unadvisableness contribute unto

the Widening of our Breaches?

ENCOUNTERED.

To say no more, there is a published and credible Rela-

tion; which affirms, That very lately in a part of England,
where
some
of the
Neighbourhood were
quarrelling,
a

Raven from the top of a tree very articulately and unac-

countably cry'd out, Read tlie Third of Colossians and tfie

Fifteenth! Were I my self to chuse what
sort of Bird I

would be transformed into, I would say,
that I had winy*

like a Dove! Nevertheless,
I will
for once do the
Office,

which as it seems, Heaven sent that Raven upon ; even to

beg, Tliat the Peace of God may Rule in our Hearts.

VI.
*Tis necessary that we unite in every thing : but

there are especially two Things wherein our Union must

cany us along
together.
We
are
to
unite
in
our En-

deavours
to
deliver our distressed Neighbours, from the

horrible Annoyances and Molestations with which a dread-

ful Witchcraft
is now persecuting of them.
To have an

hand in any thing, that may stifle
or
obstruct a Regular

Detection of that Witchcraft, is what we may well with an

holy fear avoid.
Their Majesties good Subjects must not

every day be torn to pieces by horrid Witches, and those

bloody Felons, be left wholly unprosecuted.
The Witch-

craft is a business that will not be sham'd, without plunging
us into sore Plagues, and of long continuance.
But then

we
are
to unite in such Methods for this deliverance, as

may be unquestionably
safe, lest
the latter end be worse

tJian the beginning.
And here, what shall I say ?
I will

venture to say thus much, That we are safe, when we make

just as much use of all Advice from the invisible World, as
God sends it for.
It is a safe Principle, That when God

28
ENCHANTMENTS

Almighty permits any Spirits from the unseen Regions, to

visit us with surprizing Informations, there is then some-

tiling to be enquired after
; we are then to enquire of one

another, What Cause there
is
for such things 1
The pe-

culiar Government of God, over the unbodied Intelligences,

is a sufficient Foundation for this Principle.
When there

lias been a Murder committed, an Apparition of the
slain

Party accusing of any Man, altho' such Apparitions have

oftner spoke true than false,
is not enough to Convict the

Man as guilty of that Murder; but yet
it
is a sufficient

occasion
for
Magistrates
to make a particular
Enquiry,

whether such a Man have afforded any ground for such an

Accusation.
Even so a Spectre exactly resembling such

or such a Person, when the Neighbourhood are tormented

by such Spectres, may reasonably make Magistrates
in-

quisitive whether the Person so represented have done or

said any thing that may argue their confederacy with Evil

Spirits, altho' it may be defective enough in point of Con-

viction
; especially at a time, when 'tis possible, some over-

powerful Conjurer may have got the skill of thus exhibiting

the Shapes of all sorts of Persons, on purpose to stop the

Prosecution
of the Wretches, whom due
Enquiries thus

provoked, might have made obnoxious unto Justice.

Quaere, Whether if God would have us to proceed any

further than bare Enquiry, upon what reports there may
come against any Man, from the World ofSpirits, he will

not by his Providence at the same time have brought into

our hands, these more evident and sensible things, where-

upon a man
is
to be esteemed a Criminal.
But I will

venture to say this further, that
it will be safe to account

ENCOUNTERED,
29

the Names as well
as the Lives of our Neighbors
; two

considerable things to be brought under a Judicial Process,

until it be found by Humane Observations that the Peace of

Mankind is thereby disturbed. We are Humane Creatures,
and we
are
safe while we
say,
they must be Humane

Witnesses, who also have in the particular Act of Seeing,

or Hearing, which
enables them to be Witnesses, but no

more than Humane Assistances, that are to turn the Scale
when Laws
are
to be executed.
And upon this Head I

will
further add
: A wise and a just Magistrate, may so

far give way to a common Stream of Dissatisfaction, as to

forbear acting up to the heighth of his own Perswasion,
about what may be judged
convictive
of a Crime, whose

Nature shall be so abstruse and obscure, as to raise much

Disputation.
Tho' he may not do what he should leave un-

done, yet he may leave undone something that else he could

do, when the Publick Safety makes an Exigency.

I was going to make one Venture more
; that

is, to
offer some
safe Rules,
for the
finding out
of the

Witches, which

at

but
this were a Venture too Presumptuous and Icarian

for me to make
;
I

that unto those Excellent and

Judicious Persons, with whom I am not worthy to be num-

bred

All
that
I
shall
do,
shall
be
to

before my

Readers, a brief Synopsis of what has been written on that

Subject, by a Triumvirate of as Eminent Persons as have

ever handled it.
I will begin with,

30
ENCHANTMENTS

AN ABSTRACT OF MR. PERKINS'S WAY FOR

THE DISCOVERY OF WITCHES.

I. THERE are Presumptions, which do at least probably

and conjecturally note one to be a Witch.
These give oc-

casion
to Examine, yet they are no
sufficient Causes of

Conviction.

II. If any Man or Woman be notoriously defamed for

a Witch,
this yields a strong Suspition.
Yet the Judge

ought carefully to look, that the Report be made by Men

of Honesty and Credit.

III. If a
Fellow-Witch, or Magician, give Testimony

of any Person to be a Witch
;
this indeed is not sufficient

for Condemnation; but it is a Jit Presumption to cause a

strait Examination.

IV. Ifafter Cursing there foliow Death, or at least some

mischief : for Witches are wont
to practise
their mis-

chievous Facts, by Cursing and Banning :
This also
is a

sufficient matter of Examination, tho' net of Conviction.

V. If after Enmity,
Quarrelling, or
Threatning, a

present mischief doesfollow ; that also is a great Presump-

tion.

VI. If the Party suspected be the Son or Daughter, the

man-servant or maid-servant, the Familiar Friend, near

Neighbor, or old Companion, of a known and convicted

IVitch;
this may be likewise a Presumption;
for Witch-

craft is an Art that may
be learned, and conveyed from

to man.

ENCOUNTERED.
31

VII. Some add thisfor a Presumption: If the Party

suspected be found to have the Devil's mark ; for it is com-

monly thought, when the Devil makes his Covenant ivith

them, he alwaies leaves his mark behind them, whereby he

knows them for his own :
a mark whereof no evident

Reason in Nature can be given.

VIII.
Lastly, If the party examined be Unconstant, or

contrary to himself, in his deliberate Ansivers, it argueth
a Guilty Conscience, which stops the freedom of Uttera/nce.
And yet there are causes of Astonishment, which may befal

the Good, as ivell as the Bad.

IX. But
then
there
is a Conviction,
discovering
the

Witch, which must pi*oceed from just and sufficientproofs,
and not from bare presumptions.

X.
Scratching of the
suspected party, and Recovery

thereupon, with several other such weak Proofs ; as also,

the fleeting of the suspected Party, thrown upon the Water;

these Proofs are so far from being sufficient, that some of
them are, after a sort, practices of Witchcraft.

XI.
The Testimony of some Wizzard, tho' offering to

shew the Witches Face in a Glass :
This, I grant, may be

a good Presumption, to cause a strait Examination ; but

a sufficient Proofof Conviction it cannot be.
If the Devil

tell the Grand Jury, that theperson in question is a Witch,
and offers withal to confirm the same by Oath, sJwuld the

Inquest receive his Oath or Accusation to condemn the man ?

Assuredly no.
And yet, that is as much as the Testimony

of another Wizzard, w/io only by the Devil's fielp reveals

the Witch.

XII. If a man, being dangerously sick, and like to d$v,

32
EXCHA NTMENTS

upon Suspicion, will take it on his Death, that such a one

hath bewitched him, it is an Allegation of the same nature,
which may move the Judge to examine the Party, but it is

of no moment for Conviction.

XIII. Among the sufficient means of Conviction, the

first is, the free and voluntary Confession of the Crime,
made by the party suspected and accused, after Exami-

nation.
I say not, that a bare confession is sufficient, but

a Confession
after due Examination, taken upon preg-

nant presumptions.
What needs now more witness or

further Enquiry ?

XIV.
There
is a second
sufficient Conviction, by the

Testimony of two Witnesses, of good and honest Report,

avouching before the Magistrate, upon theirown Knowledge^

these two things:
either that the party accused hath made

a League with the Devil, or hath done some known practice

of ivitchcraft.
A nd,
all Arguments that do
necessarily

prove either of these, being brought by two sufficient Wit-

nesses, are offorce fully to convince the party suspected.

XV. If it can be proved, that the party suspected hath

called upon the Devil, or desired his Help, this is a preg-
nant proof of a League formerly made between them.

XVI. If it can be proved, that the party hath entertained

a Familiar Spirit, and had Conference with it, in the like-

ness of some visible Creatures ; here is Evidence of witch-

craft.

XVII. If the witnesses affirm upon Oath, that the sus-

pected person hath done any action or work which neces-

sarily
infers
a
Covenant made,
as,
that he hath used

Enchantments, divined things before they come to pa-ss, and

ENCOUNTERED.
33

that peremptorily, raised Tempests, caused the Form ofa

dead man to appear; itproveth sufficiently, that he or she

is a Witch.
This is the Substance of Mr. Perkins.

' Take next the Sum of Mr. Gaules Judgment about the

1 Detection of Witches.
1. Some Tokens for the Trial of

'Witches,
are
altogether unwarrantable.
Such
are the

'old Paganish Sign,
the Witches Long Eyes;
the
Tra-

* dition of Witches not weeping ; the casting of the Witch

'into
the
Water, with Thumbs
and
Toes
ty'd
a-cross.

' And many more such Marks, which if they are to know

' a Witch by, certainly 'tis no other Witch, but the User

'of them.
2. There
are some Tokens
for the
Trial
of

'Witches, more probable, and yet not
so
certain
as
to

' afford Conviction.
Such are strong and long Suspicion
:

' Suspected Ancestors, some appearance of Fact, the Corps

'

bleeding upon the Witches touch, the Testimony of the

Party bewitched, the supposed Witches unusual Bodily

'marks,
the Witches
usual
Cursing and
Banning,
the

' Witches lewd and naughty kind of Life.
3. Some Signs

' there are of a Witch, more certain and
infallible.
As,

'firstly,
Declining of Judicature,
or
faultering,
faulty,

'

unconstant, and contrary Answers, upon judicial and de-

' liberate examination.
Secondly, When upon due Enquiry

' into a person's Faith and Manners, there are found all

4 or most of the Causes which produce Witchcraft, namely,

' God forsaking, Satan invading, particular Sins disposing ;
'and
lastly,
a compact compleating
all.
Thirdly, The

' Witches free Confession, together with
full Evidence of

34
ENCHANTMENTS

1 the Fact.
Confession without Fact may be a meer De-

'lusion,
and
Fact
without
Confession may
be
a meer

* Accident.
4:thly, The semblable Gestures and Actions of

suspected Witches, with the comparable Expressions of Af-

'

fections,which in all Witches have been observ'd and found

' very much alike.
Fifthly, The Testimony of the Party be-

witched,whether pining or dying, together with the joynt

* Oaths of sufficient persons,
that have seen certain pro-

'

digious Pranks or Feats, wrought by the Party accused.

' 4. Among the most unhappy circumstances to convict a

'Witch, one
is, a maligning and oppugning
the Word,

'Work, and Worship of God, and by any extraordinary

sign seeking to seduce any from
it.
See Deut.
13. 1, 2.

'Mat. 24. 24. Act. 13.
8,
10. 2 Tim. 3. 8. Do but mark

' well the places, and for this very Property (of thus oppos-

*

ing and perverting) they are
all there concluded arrant

' and
absolute Witches.
5.
It
is
not
requisite, that
so

'palpable Evidence of Conviction should here come in, as

' in other more sensible matters
;
'tis enough,
if there be

* but so much circumstantial Proof or Evidence,
as
the

'

Substance, Matter, and Nature of such an abstruse Mystery

* of Iniquity will well admit.

[/ suppose he means, that

whereas in other Crimes we lookfor more direct proofs, in

this there is a greater use of consequential
ones.~\

' But

' I could heartily wish, that the Juries were empanell'd of

4 the most eminent Physicians, Lawyers, and Divines that

1 a Country could afford.
In the mean time
'tis not to be

4 called a Toleration,
if Witches escape, where Conviction

' is wanting.'
To this purpose our Gaule.

I will transcribe a little from one Author more,
'tis the

ENCOUNTERED.
35

Judicious Bernard of Batcomb, who in his Guide to grand

Jurymen, after he has mention'd several things that are

shrewd Presumptions of a Witch, proceeds to such things

as are the Convictions of such an one.
And he says,

* A

1 witch in league with the Devil
is convicted by these Evi-

1 dences ;
I. By
a witches Mark ;
which
is upon
the

4 Baser
sort of Witches
;
and
this, by the Devils either

1 Sucking or Touching of them.
Tertullian says, It is the

' Devils custome to mark his.
And note, That this mark

* is Insensible, and being prick'd it will not Bleed.
Some

*

times,
its like a Teate ; sometimes but a Bleiuish Spot ;

1 sometimes a Red one
;
and sometimes the flesh Sunk :

1 but the Witches do sometimes cover them.
II. By the

1 Witches Words.
As when they have been heard calling

on, speaking to, or Talking of their Familiars ;
or, when

4 they have been heard Telling of Hurt they have done to

' man or beast
: Or when they have been heard Threatning

* of such Hurt
; Or if they have been heard Relating their

' Transportations.
III.
By
the
Witches
Deeds.
As

' when they have been seen with their
Spirits, or seen se-

*

cretly Feeding any of their Imps.
Or, when there can

' be found their Pictures, Poppets, and other Hellish Com-

*

positions.
IV.
By the Witches
Extasies :
With
the

'Delight whereof, Witches are
so taken, that they will

1 hardly conceal the same
:
Or, however at some time or

other, they may be found in them.
V. By one or more

1 Fellow- Witches, Confessing
their own Witchcraft, and

*

bearing Witness against others ;
if they can make good

' the Truth of their Witness, and give sufficient proof of it.

*

As, that they have seen them with their Spirits, or, that

36
ENCHANTMENTS

* they have Received Spirits from them
;
or that they can

*

tell, when they used Witchery-Tricks
to Do Harm
;
or,

4 that they told them what Harm they had done
;
or that

' they can show the mark upon them ;
or, that they have

' been together in their Meetings
; and such like.
VI. By

'some
Witness
of God
Himself,
happening
upon
the

* Execrable Curses
of Witches upon themselves, Praying

4 of God to show some Token, if they be Guilty.
VII. By

'the Witches own
Confession, of Giving their
Souls
to

' the Devil.'
It is no Rare thing, for Witches to Confess.

They are Considerable Things, which I have thus Recited ;

and yet it must be with Open Eyes, kept upon Open Rules,

that we are to follow these things,

S.
8. But Juries are not the only Instruments to be

imploy'd in such a Work
;
all Christians are to be con-

cerned with daily and fervent Prayers, for the assisting of

it.
In the Days of Athanasius, the Devils were found

unable to stand
before, that Prayer, however then used

perhaps with too much of Ceremony, Let God Arise, Let

his Enemies be Scattered.
Let them also that Hate Him,

flee before Him.

that instead of letting our Hearts Rise against one

another, our Prayers might Rise unto an high pitch of Im-

portunity, for such a Rising of the Lord
!
Especially, Let

them that are Suffering by
Witchcraft, be sure to stay

and pray, and Beseech
the Lord
thrice, even as much as

ever they can, before they complain of any Neighbour for

afflicting them. Let them also that are accused of Witchcraft,

set themselves to Fast and Pray, and so shake
off the

Daemons that would like Vipers
fasten upon them
; and

get the Waters of Jealousie made profitable to them.

Thou Hope of New-England, and

A DISCOURSE ON THE WONDERS OF

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.

UTTERED (IN PART) ON AUG.
4, 1692.

Ecclesiastical History has Reported it unto us, That a Renowned

Martyr at the Stake, seeing the Book of the REVELATION thrown

by his no less Profane than Bloody Persecutors, to be burn'd in

the same Fire with himself, he cryed out,
Beata Apocalypsis;

quam bene mecumagitur,qui tecumComburar! BLESSED REVELA-

TION
! said he, Hoio Blessed am I in this Fire, ivhile I have Thee

to bear me Company. As for our selves this Day, 'tis a Fire of sore

Affliction and Confusion, wherein we are Embroiled
; but it is no

inconsiderable Advantage unto us, that we have the Company of

this Glorious and Sacred Book the REVELATION to assist us in our

Exercises.
From that Book there is one Text, which I would

single out at this time to lay before you
;
'tis that in

REVEL, xn. 12.

Wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth, and of the Sea ; for the Devil is

come doivn unto you, having great Wrath ; because he knou-eth,

that he hath but a short time.

HE Text is Like the Cloudy and Fiery Pillar,

vouchsafed unto Israel, in the Wilderness of

old
;
there
is a very dark side of it
in the

Intimation,
that, The Devil
is come down

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
39

having great Wrath ; but it has also a bright side, when

it assures
us,
that, He has but a short time ; Unto the

Contemplation of both, I do this Day Invite you.

We have
in our Hands a Letter from our Ascended

Lord in Heaven, to Advise us of his being still alive, and

of his Purpose
e're
long, to give us a Visit, wherein we

shall see our Living Redeemer, stand at the latter day upon

the Earth.
'Tis the
last Advice that we have had from

Heaven, for now sixteen Hundred years
; and the scope of

it, is, to represent how the Lord Jesus Christ having begun

to set up his Kingdom
in the World, by the preaching of

the Gospel, he would from time to time utterly break to

pieces all Powers that should make Head against
it, until,

The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdomes
of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall Reign for ever
and ever.
Tis a Commentary on what had been written

by
Daniel,
about, The fourth Monarchy ;
with some

Touches upon, The Fifth ; wherein, The greatness of the

Kingdom under the whole Heaven, shall be given
to
the

people of the Saints of the most High : And altho' it have,

as 'tis expressed by one of the Ancients, Tot Sacramenta

quot verba, a Mystery in every Syllable, yet it is not alto-

gether to be neglected with
such a
Despair,
as that, /

cannot Read, for the Book is Sealed.
It is a REVELATION,

and a singular, and notable Blessing is pronouuc'd upon
them that humbly study
it.

The Divine Oracles, have with a most admirable Artifice

and Carefulness, drawn, as the very pious Beverley, has la-

boriously Evinced, an exact LINE OF TIME, from the first

Sabbath at the Creation of the World, unto the great Sab-

40
THE WONDERS OF

batism at the Restitution of all Things.
In that famous

Line of Time, from the Decree for the Restoring of Jeru-

salem, after the Babylonish Captivity, there seem to remain

a matter of Two Thousand and Three Hundred Years,
unto that Neiv Jerusalem, whereto the Church
is
to be

advanced, when the mystical Babylon shall be fallen.
At

the
Resurrection
of our Lord,
there were
seventeen
or

eighteen Hundred
of those Years, yet upon the Line, to

run unto, The rest which remains for the People of God ;
and
this Remnant
in
the Line of Time,
is
here
in our

Apocalypse, variously Embossed, Adorned, and Signalized
with such Distinguishing Events,
if we mind them,
will

help us escape that Censure, Can ye not Discern the Signs

of the Times ?

The Apostle John,
for the View of these Things, had

laid before him, as I conceive, a Book, with leaves, or folds
;

which Volumn was written both on the Backside, and on

the Inside, and Roll'd up in a
Cylindriacal Form, under

seven Labels, fastned with so many Seals.
The first Seal

being opened, and the first Label removed, under the first

Label the Apostle saw what he saw, of a first Rider Pour-

tray'd, and so on, till the last Seal was broken up ; each

of the Sculptures
being enlarged with
agreeable
Visions

and Voices, to illustrate
it.
The Book being now Unrolled,

there were Trumpets, with wonderful
Concomitants,
Ex-

hibited
successively
on
the Expanding Backside
of
it.

Whereupon the Book was Eaten, as it were to be Hidden,
from Interpretations ;
till afterwards, in the Inside of it,

the Kingdom of Anti-christ came to be Exposed.
Thus,

the Judgments of God on the Roman Empire,
first unto

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
41

the Downfal of Paganism, and then, unto the Downfal of

Popery, which
is but Revived Paganism,
are
in
these

Displayes, with Lively Colours and Features made sensible

unto us.

Accordingly, in the Twelfth Chapter of this Book, we

have an August Preface, to the Description of that Horrid

Kingdom, which our Lord Christ refused, but Antichrist

accepted, from the Devils Hands ; a Kingdom, which for

Twelve Hundred and Sixty Years together, was
to be
a

continual oppression upon the People of God, and opposition
unto
his
Interests ;
until the Arrival of that Illustrious

Day,
wherein, The Kingdom
shall be the Lords, and he

shall be Govemour among the Nations.
The Chapter is

(as an Excellent Person calls it) an Extravasated Account

of the Circumstances, which befell the Primitive Church,

during the
first Four or Five Hundred Years of Christi-

anity
:
It shows us the Face of the Church, first in Rome

Heathenish, and then in Rome Converted, before the Man

of Sin was yet come to Mans Estate.
Our Text contains

the Acclamations made upon the most Glorious Revolution

that ever yet happened upon the Roman Empire
; namely,

That
wherein
the
Travailing Church
brought
forth
a

Christian Emperour.
This was a most Eminent
Victory

over the Devil, and Resemblance of the State, wherein the

World, ere long shall see,
TJie Kingdom of our God, and

the Power of his Chrisl.
It is here noted,

First, as a matter of Triumph.
'Tis
said, Rejoyce, ye

Heavens, and ye that dwell in them.
The Saints in both

Worlds, took the Comfort of this Revolution
the Devout

Ones that had outlived the late Persecutions, were filled

42
THE WONDERS OF

with Transporting Joys, when they saw the Christian be-

come
the Imperial Religion, and when they saw Good

Men come to give Law unto the rest of Mankind;
the

Deceased Ones
also, whose Blood had been Sacrificed in

the Ten Persecutions,
doubtless made the Light Regions

to ring with Hallelujahs unto God, when there were brought
unto them, the Tidings of the Advances now given to the

Christian Religion, for which they had suffered Martyrdom.

Secondly, As a matter of Horror.

;Tis said, Wo to the

Jnhabiters of the Earth and of the Sea.
The Earth still

means the False Church, the Sea means the Wide World,

in Prophetical Phrasseology.
There was yet left a vast party

of Men that were Enemies to the Christian Religion, in

the power of it
; a vast party
left
for the Devil to work

upon

: Unto these is a Wo denounced ; and why so ?
'Tis

added, for the Devil is come down unto you, having great

Wrath, because he knows, that
he. has but a short
time.

These were,
it seems, to have some desperate and peculiar

Attempts of the Devil made upon them.
In the mean time,

we may Entertain this for our Doctrine,

Great Wo proceeds from the Great WRATH, with which

the DEVIL, towards
the end of his TIME, will make a

DESCENT upon a miserable World.

I have now Published a most awful and solemn Warning

for our selves
at
this day ; which has four Propositions,

comprehended in
it.

Proposition I.
That there is a Devil, is a thing Doubted

by none but such as are under the Influences of the Devil.

For any to deny the Being of a Devil must be from an

Ignorance or Profaneness, worse than Diabolical. A Devil.

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
43

What is that ? We have a Definition of the Monster, in

Eph.
6.
12.
A Spiritual Wickedness, that is, A wicked

Spirit.
A Devil is a Fallen Angel, an Angel Fallen from

the Fear and Love of God, and from all Celestial Glories
;

but Fallen to all manner of Wretchedness and Cursedness.
He was once in that Order of Heavenly Creatures, which
God in the Beginning made Ministering Spirits, for his
own peculiar Service and Honour, in the management of

the Universe; but we may now write that Epitaph upon

him, How art thou fallen from Heaven! thou hast said in

thine Heart, I will Exalt my Throne above
the Stars of

God ; but thou art brought down to Hell ! A Devil is a

Spiritual and Rational Substance, by his Apostacy from

God, inclined unto all that is Vicious, and for that Apostacy

confined unto the Atmosphere of this
Earth, in Chains

under Darkness, unto
the Judgment of the Great Day.

This is a Devil ; and the Experience of Mankind as well

as the Testimony of Scripture, does abundantly prove the

Existence of such a Devil.

About
this Devil, there
are many
things, whereof we

may reasonably and profitably be Inquisitive ; such things,

I mean, as are in our Bibles Reveal'd unto us
;
according

to which
if we do not
speak, on so dark a Subject, but

according to our own uncertain, and perhaps hurnoursome

Conjectures, There
is no Light in us.
I
will carry you

with me, but unto one Paragraph of the Bible,
to be
in-

formed
of three Things,
relating
to the Devil;
'tis the

Story of the Gadaren Energumen, in the fifth Chapter of

Mark.

First, then, 'Tis to be granted
; the Devils are so many,

44
THE WONDERS OF

that some Thousands, can sometimes at once apply them-

selves to vex one Child of Man.
It is said in Mark 5. 15.

He
that was Possessed with the Devil, had
the Legion.

Dreadful
to be spoken

!
A Legion
consisted of Twelve

Thousand Five Hundred People

: And we see that in one

Man or two, so many Devils can be spared for a Garrison.
As the Prophet cryed out, Multitudes, Multitudes, in the

Valley of Decision f Sol say, There are multitudes, mul-

titudes, in the valley of Destruction, where the Devils are !
When we speak of, The Devil, 'tis, A name of Multitude ;

it means not One Individual Devil, so Potent and Scient,

as perhaps a Manichee would imagine; but
it means a

Kind, which a Multitude belongs unto.
Alas, the Devils,

they swarm about us, like the Frogs of Egypt, in the most

Retired of our Chambers.
Are we at our Boards ?
There

will be Devils to Tempt us unto Sensuality
: Are we in our

Beds ?
There will be Devils to Tempt us unto Carnality

:

Are we in our Shops ?
There will be Devils to Tempt us

unto Dishonesty.
Yea, Tho' we get into the Church of

God, there will be Devils to Haunt us in the very Temple

it self, and there tempt us to manifold Misbehaviours.
I

am
verily perswaded, That there
are very few Humane

Affairs whereinto some Devils are not Insinuated
;
There

is not so much as a Journey intended, but Satan will have

an hand in hindering or furthering of it.

Secondly, 'Tis to be supposed, That there
is a sort
of

Arbitrary, even
Military Government, among the Devils.

This is intimated, when in Mar. 5.
9. The unclean Spirit

said, My Name is Legion : they are such a Discipline as

Legions use to be.
Hence we read about, The Prince of

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
45

the power of the Air : Our Air has a power ?
or an Army

of Devils in the High Places of it
; and these Devils have

a Prince
over them, who
is King over the Children of

Pride.
Tis probable, That the Devil, who was the Ring-

leader of that mutinous and rebellious Crew, which first

shook off the Authority of God, is now the General of those

Hellish Armies ; Our Lord, that Conquered him, has told

us the Name of him
;
'tis Belzebub ;
'tis he that
is the

Devil, and the rest are his Angels, or his Souldiers.
Think

on vast Regiments of cruel and bloody French Dragoons,
with an
Intendant
over
them,
overrunning
a
pillaged

Neighbourhood, and you will think a little, what the Con-

stitution among the Devils is.

Thirdly,
'tis to be supposed, that some Devils are more

peculiarly Commissioned, and perhaps Qualify'd, for some

Countries, while others are for others.
This is intimated

when in Mar. 5. 10. The Devils besought our Lord much,

that he would not send them away out of the Countrey.
Why was that ? But in all probability, because these Devils

were more able to do the works of the Devil, in such a

Countrey, than
in
another.
It
is
not likely that every

Devil does know every Language ; or that every Devil can

do every Mischief.
'Tis possible, that the Experience, or,

if I may call it so, the Education of all Devils is not alike,
and that there may be some difference in their Abilities.

If one might make an Inference from what the Devils do,

to what they are, One cannot forbear dreaming, that there

are degrees of Devils.
Who can allow, that such Trifling

Daemons, as that of Mascon, or those that once infested our

Neiu berry, are of so much Grandeur, as those Dctmcms,

46
THE WONDERS OF

whose Games
are mighty Kingdoms?
Yea,
'tis
certain,

that all Devils do not make a like Figure in the Invisible

World.
Nor does
it look agreeably, That the Damons,

which were the Familiars of such a Man as the old Apol-

lonius, differ not from those baser Goblins that chuse to

Nest in the filthy and loathsom Rags of a beastly Sorceress.

Accordingly, why may not some Devils be more accom-

plished for what
is to be done
in such and such
places,

when others must be detach'd for other Territories?
Each

Devil, as he sees his advantage, cries out, Let me be in this

Countrey, rather than another.
But Enough,
if not too

much, of these things.

Proposition
II.
There
is a Devilish
Wrath
against

Mankind, with which the Demi is for God's sake Inspired.
The Devil
is himself broiling under the intolerable and

interminable Wrath of God
; and a
fiery Wrath at God,

is, that which the Devil is for that cause Enflamed.
Me-

thinks I see the posture of the Devils in Isa. 8. 21.
They

fret themselves, and Curse
their God, and look upward.

The first and chief Wrath of the Devil, is at the Almighty
God himself; he knows, The God that made him, will not

have mercy on him, and the God that formed him, will

shew him no favour ;
and so he can have no Kindness

for that God, who has no Mercy, nor Favour for him.

Hence
'tis, that he cannot bear the Name of God should

be acknowledged in the World
: Every Acknowledgement

paid unto God,
is a fresh drop of the burning Brimstone

falling upon the Devil
; he does make
his
Insolent, tho'

Impotent Batteries, even upon the Throne of God himself
:

and
foolishly
affects
to have
himself exalted unto that

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
47

Glorious High Throne, by all people, as he sometimes
is,

by Execrable
Witches.
This
horrible Dragon
does
not

only with his Tayl strike at the Stars of God, but at the
God himself, who made the Stars, being desirous to out-

shine them
all.
God and the Devil are sworn Enemies to

each other ;
the Terms between them, are those, in Zech.

11.18. My Soul loathed them, and their Soul also abhorred

me.
And from
this Furious wrath,
or Displeasure and

Prejudice at God, proceeds the Devils wrath at us, the poor

Children of Men.
Our doing the Service of God,
is one

thing that exposes us to the wrath of the Devil.
We are

the High Priests of the World
; when
all Creatures
are

called upon,
Praise ye the Lord, they bring
to us
those

demanded Praises of God, saying, do you offer them for

us.
Hence
'tis, that the Devil has a Quarrel with us, as

he had with the High-Priest in the Vision of Old.
Our

bearing the Image of God is another thing that brings the

wrath of the Devil upon us.
As a Tyger, thro his Hatred

at man will tear the very Picture of him, if it come in his

way
; such a Tyger the Devil is
; because God said of old,

Let us make Man in our Image, the Devil is ever saying,
Let us pull this man to pieces.
But the envious Pride of

the Devil,
is one thing more that gives an Edge unto his

Furious Wrath against us.
The Apostle has given us an

hint, as if Pride had been the Condemnation of the Devil.

'Tis not unlikely, that the Devil's Affectation to be above

that Condition which he might learn that Mankind was to

be preferr'd unto, might be the occasion of his taking up
Arms
against the Immortal King.
However, the Devil

now sees Man lying
in the Bosom of God, but himself

48
THE WONDERS OF

damned in the bottom of Hell ; and
this enrages him ex-

ceedingly ;
0, says he, / cannot bear it, that man should

not be as miserable as my self.

Proposition III.
The Devil, in the prosecution, and the

execution of his wrath upon them, often gets a Liberty to
make a Descent upon the Children of men.
When the

Devil does hurt unto us, he comes down unto us
for the

Rendezvouze of the Infernal Troops,
is indeed in the su-

pernal parts of our Air.
But as 'tis said, A sparroiv of the

Air does not fall down without the will of God ;
so I may

say, Not a Devil in the Air, can come down without
the,

leave of God.
Of this we have a famous Instance in that

Arabian Prince, of whom the Devil was not able so much

as to Touch any thing, till the most high God gave him a

permission, to go down.
The Devil stands with
all the

Instruments of death, aiming at
us, and begging of the

Lord, as that King ask'd for the Hood-wink'd Syrians of

old, Shall I smite

}
em, shall I smite 'em ? He cannot strike

a blow,
till the Lord say, Go down and smite, but some-

times he does obtain from the highpossessor of Heaven and

Earth, a License for the doing of
it.
The Devil some-

times does make most rueful Havock among us ;
but still

we may say to him, as our Lord said unto a great Servant

of his, Thou couldest have no power against me, except it

were given thee from above.
The Devil is called in 1
. Pet.

5.
8. Your Adversary.
This is a Law-term
; and it notes

An Adversary at Law.
The Devil cannot come at
us,

except in some sence according to Law ; but sometimes he

does procure sad things to be
inflicted, according to the

Law of the eternal King upon us.
The Devil first goes up

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
49

as an Accuser against us.
He is therefore styled The Ac-

cuser; and it is on this account, that his proper Name does

belong unto him.
There is a Court somewhere kept ; a

Court of Spirits, where the Devil enters
all sorts of Com-

plaints against us
all
; he charges us with manifold sins

against the Lord our God
:
There he loads us with heavy

Imputations of Hypocrysie, Iniquity, Disobedience; where-

upon he urges, Lord,
let 'em now have the death, which is

their wages, paid unto 'em ! If ourA dvocate in the Heavens

do not now take
off his Libels ; the Devil, then, with a

Concession
of God, comes down, as a destroyer upon us.

Having first been an Attorney', to bespeak that the Judg-
ments of Heaven may be ordered for us, he then also pleads,

that he may be the Executioner of those Judgments ; and

the God of Heaven sometimes after a sort, signs a Warrant,

for this destroying Angel, to do what has been desired to

be done for the destroying ofmen.
But such a permission

from God, for the Devil to come down, and break in upon

mankind, oftentimes must be accompany'd with a Commis-

sion from some wretches of mankind it self.
Every man

is, as
'tis hinted in Gen.
4.
9. His brother's keeper.
We

are to keep one another from the Inroads of the Devil, by
mutual and cordial Wishes of prosperity
to one another.

When ungodly people give
their Consents in witchcrafts

diabolically performed, for the Devil to annoy their Neigh-

bours,
he
finds a breach made
in the Hedge about
us,

whereat he Rushes in upon us, with grievous molestations.

Yea, when the impious people, that never saw the Devil,
do but utter their Curses against their Neighbours, those

are
so many ivatch words, whereby the Mastives of Hell

50
THE WONDERS OF

are animated presently to fall upon us.
'Tis thus, that the

Devil gets leave to worry us.

Proposition I V. Most horrible woes come to be inflicted

upon Mankind, when the Devil does in great wrath, make

a descent upon them.
The Devil is a Do-Evil, and wholly

set upon
mischief.
When our Lord
once was going to

Muzzel him, that he might not mischief others, he cry'd

out, Art thou come to torment me?
He is,
it seems, him-

self Tormented, if he be but Restrained from the torment-

ing
of Men,
If upon
the sounding
of the Three
last

Apocalyptical Angels,
it was an outcry made in Heaven,

Wo, wo, wo, to the inhabitants of the Earth by reason of

tfie voice of the Trumpet.
I am
sure, a descent made by

the Angel of death, would give cause for the like
Excla-

mation
:
Wo to the world, by reason of the ivrath of the

Devil ! what a woful plight, mankind would by the descent

of the Devil be brought
into, may be gathered from the

woful pains, and wounds, and hideous desolations which

the Devil
brings upon them,
with whom he has with a

bodily Possession made a Seisure.
You may both in Sacred

and Profane History, read many a direful Account of the

woes, which they that are possessed by the Devil, do undergo
:

And from thence conclude, What must the Children ofMen

hope from such a Devil!
Moreover, the Tyrannical Cere-

monies, whereto the Devil uses to subjugate such Woful
Nations or Orders of Men, as are more Entirely under his

Dominion, do declare what woful Work the Devil would

make where he conies.
The very Devotions of those for-

lorn Pagans, to whom the Devil
is a Leader, are most

bloody Penances ; and what Woes indeed must we expect

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
51

from such a Devil of a Moloch,
as relishes no
Sacrifices

like those of Humane Heart-Blood, and unto whom there

is no Musick like the bitter, dying, doleful Groans, ejacu-

lated by the Roasting Children of Men.

Furthermore,
the
servile,
abject,
needy
circumstances

wherein the Devil keeps the Slaves, that are under his more

sensible Vassalage, do
suggest unto
us, how
woful the

Devil would render all our Lives.
We that live in a Pro-

vince, which
affords unto us all that may be necessary or

comfortable for us, found the Province fill'd with vast Herds

of Salvages, that never saw so much as a Knife, or a Nail,

or a Board,
or a Grain
of Salt, in
all
their Days.
No

better would the Devil have the World provided for.
Nor

should we, or any else, have one convenient thing about

us, but be as indigent as usually our most Ragged Witches

are
;
if the Devil's Malice were not over-ruled by a com-

passionate God, who preserves Man and Beast.
Hence

'tis, that
the Devil, even like a Dragon, keeping a Guard

upon such Fruits as would refresh a languishing World,
has hindred Mankind for many Ages, from
hitting those

useful Inventions, which yet were so obvious andfacil, that

it is every bodies wonder, they were no sooner hit upon.
The bemisted World, must jog on for thousands of Years,
without the knowledg of the Loadstone, till a Neapolitan
stumbled upon
it, about three hundred years ago.
Nor

must the World be blest with such a matchless Engine of

Learning and Vertue, as that of Printing,
till about the

middle of the Fifteenth Century.
Nor could One Old Man,

all
over
the Face of the whole Earth, have
the benefit

of such a
Little, tho most needful
thing,
as a pair of

52
THE WONDERS OF

Spectacles, till a Dutch-Man, a little while ago accommo-

dated us.

Indeed,
as
the Devil does begrutch us
all manner
of

Good, so he does annoy us with all manner of Wo, as often

as he
finds himself capable
of doing
it.
But
shall we

mention some of the special woes with which the Devil does

usually infest the World
!
Briefly then ; Plagues are some

of those woes with which the Devil troubles us.
It is said

of the Israelites, in 1 Cor. 10. 10. They were destroyed of

the destroyer.
That
is, they had the Plague among them.

JTis the Destroyer, or the Devil, that scatters Plagues about

the World.
Pestilential and Contagious Diseases, 'tis the

Devil who does oftentimes invade us with them.

;Tis no

unaasy thing for the Devil to impregnate the Air about us,
with such Malignant Salts as meeting with the Salt, of our

Microcosm,
shall immediately cast us into that Fermen-

tation and Putrefaction, which will utterly dissolve all the

Vital Tyes within us ; Ev'n as an Aqua-Fortis, made with

a conjunction of Nitre and Vitriol, Corrodes what it Seizes

upon.
And when the Devil has raised
those Arsenical

Fumes, which become Venemous Quivers full of Terrible

Arrows, how easilv can he shoot the deleterious Miasms

into those Juices
or Bowels of Mens Bodies, which will

soon Enflame them with a Mortal Fire
!
Hence come such

Plagues, as that Beesom of Destruction, which within our

memory swept away such
a Throng of People from one

English City in one Visitation ; And hence those Infectious

Fevers, which are but so many Disguised Plagues among

us,
causing Epidemical
Desolations.
Again,
Wars
are

also some of those Woes with which the Devil causes our

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
53

Trouble.
It
is said in Rev.
12. 17.
The Dragon was

Wrath, and he went to make War; and there is in truth

scarce any War, but what
is
of the Dragon's kindling.

The Devil
is that Vulcan, out of whose Forge come the

instruments of our Wars, and it
is he that finds us Em-

ployments
for those Instruments.
We read concerning

Dcemoniacks, or People in whom the Devil was, that they
would cut and wound themselves; and so, when the Devil

is
in Men, he puts 'em upon dealing in
that barbarous

fashion with one another.
Wars do often furnish him with

some Thousands of Souls in one Morning from one Acre

of Ground; and for the sake of such Thyestcean Banquets,
he will push us upon as many Wars as he can.

Once more, why may not Storms be reckoned among

those
Woes, with which the Devil does disturb us ?
It is

not improbable that Natural Storms on the World are often

of the Devils raising.
We are told in Job
1,
11, 12,
19.

that the Devil made a Storm, which hurricano'd the House

of Job, upon the Heads of them that were Feasting in
it.

Paracelsus could have informed the Devil,
if he had not

been informed,
as besure he was
before, That
if much

A luminious matter, with Salt Petre not throughly prepared,
be mixed, they will send up a cloud of Smoke, which will

come down in Rain.
But undoubtedly the Devil under-

stands as well the way to make a Tempest as to turn the

Winds at the Solicitation of'a Laplander ; whence perhaps

it
is,
that Thunders
are observed
oftner
to break upon

Churches than upon any other Buildings;
and
besides

many a Man, yea many a Ship,
yea, many a Town has

miscarried, when the Devil has been permitted from above

54
THE WONDERS OF

to make an horrible Tempest.
However that the Devil

has raised many Metaphorical Storms upon the Church, is

a thing, than which there is nothing more notorious.
It

was said unto Believers in Rev.
2.
10. The Devil
Khali

cast some of you into Prison. The Devil was he that at

first
set Cain upon Abel to butcher him, as the Apostle

seems to
suggest, for his Faith
in God,
as a Rewardcr.

And in how many Persecutions, as well as Heresies, has the

Devil been ever since Engaging all the Children of Cain!

That Serpent the Devil has acted
his cursed Seed in un-

wearied endeavours to have them, Of whom the World is

not worthy, treated as those who are not ivorthy to live in

tlie World.
By the impulse of the Devil, 'tis that first the

old Heathens, and then the mad Arians were pricking
Briars to the true Servants of God ; and that the Papists

that came after them, have out done them all for Slaughters,

upon those that have been accounted as the Sheep for the

Slaughters.
The late French Persecution is perhaps the

horriblest that ever was in the World
:
And as the Devil

of Mascon seems before to have meant it in his
out-cries

upon the Miseries preparingfor the poor Hvgonots! Thus

it has been all acted by a singular Fury of the old Dragon

inspiring of his Emissaries.

But in reality, Spiritual Woes are the principal Woes

among
all
those that
the Devil would have us undone

withal.
Sins are the worst of Woes, and the Devil seeks

nothing so much as to plunge us into Sins.
"When men

do commit a Crime for which they are to be Indicted, they

are usually mov'd by the Instigation of the Devil.
The

Devil will put ill men upon being ivorse.
Was it not he

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
55

that said in 1 King. 22. 22. / will go forth, and be a lying

Spirit in the Mouth of all the Prophets ?
Even so the

Devil becomes an Unclean Spirit, a Drinking Spirit, a

Swearing Spirit, a Worldly Spirit, a Passionate Spirit,
a Revengeful Spirit, and the like in the Hearts of those

that are already too much of such a Spirit ; and thus they
become improv'd in
Sinfulness.
Yea, the Devil will put

good men upon doing ill.
Thus we read in 1 Chron. 21.

1 . Satan provoked David to number Israel.
And so the

Devil provokes men that are Eminent in Holiness unto such

things as may become eminently Pernicious
; he provokes

them
especially unto Pride, and unto many unsuitable

Emulations.
There are likewise most lamentable Impres-

sions which the Devil makes upon the Souls of Men by
way of punishment upon them for their Sins.
'Tis thus

when an Offended God puts the Souls of Men over into

the Hands of that Officer who has the power of Death, that

is, the Devil.
It is the woful Misery of Unbelievers in 2

Cor. 4. 4. The god of this World has blinded their minds.
And thus
it may be said of those woful Wretches whom

the Devil is a God unto, the Devil so muffles them that they
cannot
see
the things of their peace.
And the Devil so

hardens them, that nothing will awaken their cares about

their Souls: How come so many to be Seared in their

Sins 1
'Tis the Devil that with a red hot Iron fetcht from

his Hell does cauterise them.
Thus
'tis,
till perhaps at

last they come to have a Wounded Conscience in them, and

the Devil has often a share
in their Torturing and con-

founding Anguishes.
The Devil who Terrified Cain, and

Saul, and Judas into Desperation, still becomes a King of

56
THE WONDERS OF

Terrors to many Sinners, and frights them from laying
hold on the Mercy of God in the Lord Jesus Christ.
In

these regards, Wo to us, when the Devil comes down upon

us.

Proposition V.- Toward the End of his Time the Descent

of the Devil in Wrath upon the "World will produce more

woful Effects, than what have been in former Ages.
The

dying
Dragon,
will
bite
more
cruelly and
sting more

bloodily than ever he did before
:
The Death-pangs of the

Devil will make him to be more of a Devil than ever he

was; and
the Furnace
of this Nebuchadnezzar will
be

heated seven times hotter, just before its putting out.

We are in the
first place to apprehend that there is a

time
fixed and
stated by God
for the Devil
to enjoy a

dominion over our sinful and therefore woful World.
The

Devil once exclaimed in Mat. 8. 29. Jesus, thou Son of God,
art thou come hither to Torment us before our Time ?
It is

plain, that until the second coming of our Lord the Devil

must have a time of plagueing the World, which he was

afraid would have Expired at his
first.
The Devil is by

the wrath of God the Prince of this World ; and the time

of his Reign
is to continue until the time when our Lord

himself shall take to himself his great Power and Reign.
Then 'tis that the Devil shall hear the Son of God swearing
with loud thunders against him, Thy time shall now be no

more !
Then shall the Devil with his Angels receive their

doom, which will be, depart into the everlasting Fire pre-

pared for you,.

We are also to apprehend,
that in the mean time, the

Devil can give a shrewd guess, when he draws near to the

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
57

End of his Time.
When he saw Christianity enthron'd

among the Romans,
it
is here
said, in our Rev.
12. 12.

He knows he hath but a short
time.
And how does he

know it ? Why Reason will make the Devil to know that
God won't suffer him to have the Everlasting Dominion ;
and that when God has once begun to rescue the World

out of his hands, he'll go through with it, until the Captives

of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the

terrible shall be delivered.
But the Devil will have Scrip-

ture also, to make him know, that when his Antichristian

Vicar, the seven-headed Beast on the seven-hilled City,

shall have spent
his determined years, he with his Vicar

must unavoidably go down into the bottomless Pit.
It is

not improbable, that the Devil often hears the Scripture

expounded
in
our
Congregations
;
yea
that we
never

assemble without a Satan among us.
As there are some

Divines, who do with more uncertainty conjecture, from a

certain place
in the
Epistle
to the Ephesians, That the

Angels do sometimes come into our Churches, to gain some

advantage from our Ministry.
But be sure our Demon-

strable Interpretations may give Repeated Notices to the

Devil, That his time is almost out; and what the Preacher

says unto the Young Man, Know thou, that God will bring

thee into Judgment /
THAT may our Sermons tell unto the

Old Wretch, Know thou, that thy Judgment is at hand.

But we must now, likewise, apprehend, that in such a

time,
the woes of the World will be heightened, beyond

what they were at any time yet from the foundation of the

World.
Hence 'tis, that the Apostle has forewarned us, in

2 Tim. 3. 1. This know, that in the last days,perillous times

58
THE WONDERS OF

shall come.
Truly, when the Devil knows, that he is got

into his Last days, he will make perillous times for us ; the

times will grow more full of Devils, and therefore more full

of Perils, than ever they were before.
Of this, if we would

know, what cause is to be assigned ;
It is not only, because

the Devil grows more able, and more eager to vex the World ;
but also, and chieiiy, because the World is more worthy to be

vexed by the Devil, than ever heretofore.
The Sins of men

in this Generation, will be more mighty Sins, than those of

the former Ages
; men will be more Accurate and Exquisite

and Refined in the arts of Sinning, than they use to
be.

And
besides, their own
sins,
the
sins
of
all
the former

Ages will also lie upon the sinners of this generation.
Do

we ask why the mischievous powers of darkness
are
to

prevail more in our days, than they did in those that are

past and gone

!
'Tis because that men by sinning over

again the sins of the former days, have a Fellowship with

all those unfruitful works of darkness.
As 'twas said in

Matth. 23. 36. All these things shall come upon this gene-
ration ;
so, the men of the last Generation, will find them-

selves involved in the gulf of
all that went before them.

Of Sinners 'tis said. They heap up wrath ; and the sinners

of the Last Generations do not only add unto the heap of Bin

that has been pileing up ever since the Fall of man, but they

Interest themselves
in every sin
of that enormous heap.

There has been a Cry of all former ages going up to God,
That the Devil may come down ! and the sinners of the

Last Generations, do sharpen and louden that cry, till the

thing do come to pass, as Destructively as Irremediably.
From whence
it follows, that the Thrice Holy God, with

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
59

his Holy Angels, will now after a sort more abandon the

World, than
in the former ages.
The roaring Impieties

of the old World, at
last gave mankind such a distast in

the Heart of the Just God, that he came to say, It Repents

nic that I have made such a Creature ! And however,
it

may be but a witty Fancy, in a late Learned Writer, that

the Earth before the Flood was nearer to the Sun, than it

is at this Day ; and that Gods Hurling down the Earth to

a further distance from the Sun, were the cause of that

Flood
; yet we may fitly enough say, that men perished by

a Rejection from the God of Heaven.
Thus the euhanc'd

Impieties of this ourPVorld,vtill Exasperate the Displeasure

of God, at such a
rate, as that he will more cast us of,

than heretofore
;
until
at
last,
he do with
a more than

ordinary Indignation say, Go Devils ; do you take them,
and make them beyond all former measures miserable !

If Lastly, We are inquisitive
after Instances of those

aggravated woes, with which the Devil will towards the End

of his Time assault us ;
let it be remembred, That all the

Extremities which were foretold by the Trumpets and Vials

in the Apocalyptick Schemes of these things
to come upon

the World, were the woes to come from the wrath of the

Devil, upon the thortning of his Time.
The horrendous

desolations that have come upon mankind, by the Irruptions

of the old barbarians upon the Roman World, and then

of the Saracens, and
since, of the 2'urka, were such woes

as men had never seen before.
The Infandous Blindness

and
Viltness which
then came upon
mankind, and
the

Monstrous Croisadoes which thereupon carried the Roman

World by Millions together unto the Shambles
; were also

60
THE WONDERS OF

such woes as had never yet had a Parallel.
And yet these

were some of the things here intended, when
it was said,

Wo ! For the Devil is come down in great Wrath, having
but a short time.

But besides all these things, and besides the increase of

Plagues and Wars, and Storms, and Internal Maladi<*
now in our days, there are especially two most extraordi-

nary Woes, one would fear, will in these days become very

ordinary.
One Woe that may be look'd for
is, A frequent

Repetition of Earthquakes, and this perhaps by the energy
of the Devil in the Earth.
The Devil will be clap't up, as

a Prisoner in or near the Bowels of the earth, when once

that Conflagration shall be dispatched, which will make,
The New Earth wherein shall divell Righteousness ; and

that Conflagration will doubtless be much promoted, by the

Subterraneous Fires, which are a cause of the Earthquakes

in our Dayes.
Accordingly, we read, Great Earthquakes

in divers places, enumerated among
the Tokens
of the

Time approaching, when the Devil shall have no longer
Time.
I suspect, That we shall now be visited with more

Usual and yet more Fatal Earthquakes, than were our

Ancestors
;
in asmuch as the Fires that are shortly to Burn

unto the Lowest Hell, and set on Fire the Foundations of

the Mountains, will now get more Head than they use to

do ; and it is not impossible, that the Devil, who is ere long

to be punished in those Fires, may aforehand augment his

Desert of
it, by having an hand in using some
of those

Fires, for our Detriment.
Learned Men have made no

scruple
to
charge
the Devil with
it
;
Deo permittente,

Terrce motus causat.
The Devil surely, was a party in the

THE INVISIBLE WOELD.
61

Earthquake, whereby the Vengeance of God, in one black

Night sunk Twelve
considerable
Cities
of Asia,
in the

Reign of Tiberious.
But there will be more such Catas-

trophe's in our Dayes
; Italy has lately been Shaking, till

its Earthquakes have brought Ruines at once upon more

than thirty Towns
; but it will within a little while, shake

again, and shake till the Fire of God have made an Entire
Etna of it.
And behold, This very Morning, when I was

intending to utter among you such Things as these, we are

cast into an Heartquake by Tidings of an Earthquake that

has lately happened at Jamaica : an horrible Earthquake,

whereby the Tyrus of the English America, was at once

pull'd into the Jaws of the Gaping and Groaning Earth,
and many Hundreds
of
the
Inhabitants
buried
alive.

The Lord sanctifie so dismal a Dispensation of his Provi-

dence, unto all the American Plantations
! But be assured,

my Neighbours, the Earthquakes are not over yet

!
We

have not yet seen the last.
And then, Another Wo that

may be Look'd for
is, The Devils being now let Loose in

preternatural Operations more than formerly ; and perhaps

in Possessions and Obsessions that shall be very marvellous.
You are not Ignorant, That just before our Lords First

Coming, there were most observable Outrages committed

by the Devil upon the Children of Men
: And I am sus-

picious, That there will again be an unusual Range of the

Devil among us, a little before the Second Coming of our

Lord, which will be, to give the last stroke, in Destroying

the works of the Devil.
The Evening Wolves will be much

abroad, when we are near the Evening of the World.
The

Devil is going to be Dislodged of the Air, where his present

62
THE WONDERS OF

Quarters are
; God will with flashes of hot Lightning upon

him,
cause him
to fall as Lightning from
his Ancient

Habitations
:
And the Raised Saints will there have
a

New Heaven, which We expect according to the Promise

of God.
Now a little before this thing, you be like to see

the Devil more
sensible and
visibly Busy upon Earth

perhaps, than ever he was before.
You shall oftner hear

about Apparitions of the Devil, and about poor people

strangely Bewitched, Possessed and Obsessed, by Infernal

Fiends.
When our Lord is going to set up His Kingdom,

in the most sensible and visible manner, that ever was, and

in a manner answering the Transfiguration in the Mount,

it is a Thousand to One, but the Devil will in sundryparts

of the world, assay the like for Himself, with a most Apish
Imitation
: and Men, at least in some Corners of the World,

and perhaps in such as God may have some special Designs

upon,
will
to their Cost, be more Familiarized
ivith the

World of Spirits, than they had been formerly.

So that, in fine, if just before the End, when the times

of the Jews were
to be
finished, a man
then ran about

every where, crying, Wo to the Nation ! Wo to the City !
Wo to the Temple I
Wo! Wo! Wo! Much more may the

descent of the Devil, just before
his End, when also the

times of the Gentiles will be finished, cause us to cry out,
Wo! Wo! Wo!
because of the black things that threaten

us!

But it is now Time to make our Improvement of what

lias been
said.
And,
first, we shall entertain our selves

with a few Corollaries, deduced from what has been thus

asserted.

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
63

Corollary I. What cause have we to bless God, for our

preservation from the Devils wrath, in this which may too

reasonably be called the Devils World !
While we are in

this present evil world, We are continually surrounded with

swarms
of those
Devils, who make
this present world,

become
so
evil.
What a wonder of Mercy is
it, that no

Devil could ever yet make a prey of us
!
We can set our

foot no where but we shall tread
in the midst of most

Hellish Rattle-Snakes ;
and one of those Rattle-Snakes

once thro' the mouth of a Man, on whom he had
Seized,

hissed out such a Truth as this, If God would let me loose

upon you, I shouldfind enough in the Best of you all, to
make you all mine.
What shall I say ?
The Wilderness

thro

7 which we are passing to the Promised Land,
is
all

over
fill'd with Fiery flying
se^ients.
But, blessed be

God
;
None of them have hitherto so fastned upon us, as

to confound us utterly

!
All our way to Heaven, lies by the

Dens of Lions, and the Mounts of Leopards ;
there are

incredible Droves of Devils in our way.
But have we safely

got on our way thus
far ?
let us be thankful to our

Eternal preserver for it.
It is said in Psal. 76. 10. Surely

the wi*ath of Man shall praise tJiee, and the Remainder of

ivrath sJialt thou restrain ;
But surely it becomes us to

praise God, in that we have yet sustain'd no more Damage

by the wrath of the Devil, and in that he has restraint

that Overwhelming wrath.
We are poor, Travellers in a

World, which
is as well the Devils Field,
as the Devils

Gaol; a World in every Nook whereof, the Devil
is en-

camped, with Bands of Robbers, to pester
all that have

their Face looking Zion-ward : And are we all this while

64
THE WONDERS OF

preserved from the undoing Snares
of the Devil ?
it
is

Thou,
keeper of Israel,
that hast
hitherto
been our

Keeper I And therefore, Bless the Lord,
my soul, Bless

his Holy Name, who has redeemed thy Life from the Des-

troyer /

Corollary II. We may see the rise of those multiply'd,

magnify'd, and Singularly-stinged
Afflictions, -with which

aged, or dying Saints frequently have their Death Prefaced,
and their Age embittered.
When the Saints of God are

going
to leave the World,
it
is usually a more Stormy

World with them, than ever it was
; and they find more

Vanity, and more Vexation in the world than ever they

did before.
It is true, That many are the afflictions of the

Righteous ; but a little before they bid adieu to all those

many
Afflictions, they often have greater, harder, Sorer,

Loads thereof laid upon them, than they had yet endured.

It is true, That thro

1 much Tribulation we must enter in

the Kindom of God ;
but a
little
before our Entrance

thereinto, our Tribulation may have some sharper accents

of Sorrow, than ever were yet upon
it.
And what is the

cause of this ?
It is indeed the Faithfulness of our God

unto us, that we should find the Earth more full of Thorns

and Briars than ever, just before he fetches us from Earth

to Heaven ;
that so we may go away the more willingly,

the more
easily, and with less Convulsion,
at his calling

for us.
there are ugly
Ties, by which we are fastned

unto this world ;
but God will by Thorns and Briars tear

those Ties asunder.
But,
is not the hand of Joab here ?

Sure, There is the wrath of the Devil also in
it.
A little

before we step into Heaven, the Devil thinks with himself,

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
65

J/y time to abuse that Saint is now but short; what Mis-

chief I am to do that Saint, must be done quickly, if at

all;
he'l shortly be out of my Reach for ever.
And for

this cause he will now fly upon us with the Fiercest Efforts

and Furies of his Wrath.
It was allowed unto the Serpent,

in Gen.
2.
15. To Bruise the Heel.
Why,
at the Heel,

or at the Close, of our Lives, the Serpent will be nibbling,
more than ever in our Lives before
: and it is, Because noio

he has but a short time.
He knows, That we shall very

shortly be,
Where the wicked cease from Troubling, and

where the Weary are at Rest ; wherefore that Wicked one

will now Trouble us, more than ever he
did, and we shall

have so much Disrest, as will make us more iveary than

ever we were, of things here below.

Corollary III. What a Reasonable Thing then
is
it,

that they whose Time is but short, should make as great
Use
of their Time, as ever they can
!
pray, let us
learn

some good,
even from the wicked One
himself.
It has

been advised, Be wise as Serpents: why, there is a piece

of Wisdom, whereto that old Serpent, the Devil himself,
may be our Moniter.
When the Devil perceives his Time

is but short,
it puts him upon Great Wrath.
But how

should
it be with us, when we perceive that our Time is

but short? why,
it should put us upon Great Work. The

motive which makes the Devil to be more full of -wrath;

should make us more
full of warmth, more full of watch,

and more full of All Diligence to make our Vocation, and

Election
sure.
Our Pace in our Journey Hraven-ivard,

must be Quickened, ifour space for that Journey beshortned,

even
as
Israel went further the two last years of their

F

66
THE WONDERS OF

Journey Canaan-ward, than they did in 38 years before.
The Apostle brings
this, as a spur
to the Devotions
of

Christians, in
1 Cor. 7. 29. This I say, Brethren, the time

is short.
Even so, I say this ; some
things
I
lay before

you, which I do only think, or guess, but here is a thing
which I venture to say with
all the freedom imaginable.

You have now a Time to get good, even a Time to make

sure of Grace and Glory, and every good thing, by true

Repentance: But, This I say, the time is but short.
You

have now Time to Do good, even to serve out your genera-

tion, as by the
Will, so for the Praise of God ;
but, This

I say, the time is but short.
And what I say thus to All

People, I say to Old People, with a peculiar Vehemency
:

Sirs, It cannot be long before your Time is out ; there are

but a few sands left in the glass of your Time: And it is

of all things the saddest,
for a man to say, My Time is

done, but my ivork undone!
then, To work as fast as

you can ; and of Soul-work, and Church-work, dispatch as
much
as
ever you
can.
Say
to
all Hindrances, as the

gracious Jeremiah Burrows would sometimes to Visitants:

You'll excuse me if I ask you to be short with me, for my
work is great, and my time is but short.
Methinks every

time we hear a Clock, or see a Watch, we have an admo-

nition given us, that our Time is upon the wing, and it will

all be gone within a little while.
I remember I have read

of a famous man, who having a Clock-watch long lying

by him, out of Kilture in his Trunk, it unaccountably struck

Eleven just before he died.
Why, there are many of you,

for whom I am to do that office this day
:
I am to tell you

You are come
to your Eleventh hour
there is no more

THE INVISIBLE WOULD.
67

than a twelfth part at most, of your life yet behind.
But

if we
neglect our
business,
till our short Time
shall be

reduced into none, then woe to us, for the great wrath of
God will send us downfrom whence there is no Redemption.

Corollary IV.

How welcome should a Death in the Lord be unto them

that belong not unto the Devil, but unto the Lord
! While

we
are
sojourning
in
this World, we
are
in what may

upon too many accounts be
called The Devils Country:

We are where the Devil may come upon us in great wrath

continually.
The day when God shall take us out of this

World,
will be, The day when the Lord will deliver us

from the hand of all our Enemies, andfrom the hand of
Satan.
In such a day, why should not our song be that

of the Psalmist, Blessed be my Rock, and
let
the God of

my Salvation le exalted ! While we are
here, we are in

the valley of the shadow of death ; and what
is
it that

makes
it
so

?
Tis because the wild Beasts of Hell
are

lurking on every side
of us, and every minute ready to

salley forth upon us.
But our Death will fetch us out of

that
Valley, and carry us where we shall be for ever with

the Lord.
We are now under the daily Bufetings of the

Devil, and he does
molest us with such Fiery Darts,
as

cause us even to cry out, / am weary of my Life.
Yea,

but are we as willing to die,
as, weary of Life? Our Death

will then soon set us where we cannot be reach'd by the

Fist of Wickedness; and where the
Perfect
cannot
le

shotten
at.
It
is
said in Rev.
14.
13. Blessed are
the

Dead which die in the Lord, they restfrom their labours.

68
THE WONDERS OF

But we may say, Blessed are the Dead in the Lord, inas-
much as they rest from the Devils / Our dying will be but

our taking iving: When attended with a Convoy of winged

Angels, we shall be convey'd into that Heaven, from whence

the Devil having been thrown he shall never more come

thither after us.
What if God should now say to us, as to

Moses, Go up and die I
As long as we go ^lp, when we

die, let us receive the Message with a joyful Soul; we shall

soon be there, where the Devil can't come down upon us.

If the God of our Life should now send that Order to us,
which he gave to Hezeldah, Set thy house in order, for
thou shalt die, and not live; we need not be cast into such

deadly Agonies thereupon, as Hezekiah was
: We are but

going to that House, the Golden Doors whereof, cannot be

entred by the Devil
that here did use to persecute
us.

Methinks
I
see
the Departed
S}nrit
of a
Believer,
tri-

umphantly carried thro' the Devils Territories, in such a

stately and Fiery Chariot, as the Spiritualizing Body of

Elias had ; methink I see the Devil, with whole Flocks of

Harpies,
grinning
at
this
Child
of God,
but unable to

fasten any of their griping Talons upon him
: And then,

upon the utmost edge of our Atmosphere, methiuks, I over-

hear the holy Soul, with a most heavenly Gallantry, deri-

ding the defeated Fiend, and saying, Ah! Satan! Return

to thy Dungeons again ; / am going where thou canst not

come for ever !
'tis a brave thing so to die
! and espe-

cially so to die, in our
time.
For, tho' when we call to

mind, That the Devils time is now but short,
it may almost

make us wish to live unto the end of it ; and to say with

the Psalmist, Because the Lord ivill shortly appear in his

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
69

Glory, to build up Zion.
my God !
Take me not away

in the midst of my days.
Yet when we bear
in mind,

that the Devils Wrath is now most great,
it would make

one willing to be out of the way.
Inasmuch as now is the

time for the doing of those things in the prospect whereof
Balaam long ago cry'd out, Who shall live when such things

are done / We should not be inordinately loth to die at such

a time.
In a word, the Times are
so bad, that we may

well count
it, as good a time to die in, as ever we saw.

Corollary
V.

Good News for the Israel of God, and particularly
for

his New-English Israel.
If the Devils Time were above

a thousand years ago, pronounced
short, what may we

suppose it now in our Time ?
Surely we are not a thousand

years distant from those happy thousand years of rest and

peace, and [which
is
better] Holiness reserved
for the

People of God in
the
latter days ;
and
if we are not a

thousand years yet
short
of that Golden Age, there
is

cause
to think, that we are not an hundred.
That the

blessed Thousand years are not yet begun,
is abundantly

clear from this, We do not see the Devil bound ;
No, the

Devil was never more let loose than in our Days ; and it is

very much that any should imagine otherwise
: But the

same thing that proves the Thousand Years of prosperity

for the Church of God, under the whole Heaven, to be not

yet begun, does also prove, that it is not very/ar off; and

that is the prodigious wrath with which the Devil does in

our days Persecute, yea, desolate the World.
Let us cast

our Eyes almost where we will, and we shall see the Devils

70
THE WONDERS OF

domineering at such a rate as mayjustly fill us with astonish-

ment ;
it
is questionable whether Iniquity ever were so

rampant, or whether Calamity were ever so pungent, as in

this Lamentable time ; We may truly say, 'Tis the Hour
and the Power of Darkness.
But, tho the wrath be so

great, the time is but short : when we are perplexed with

the iwath of the Devil, the Word of our God at the same

time unto
us,
is that in Rom. 16. 20. The God of Peace

shall bruise Satan under yourfeet Shortly.
Shortly, didst

thou say, dearest Lord
!
gladsome word
!
Amen, Even

so, come Lord ! Loi*d Jesus, come quickly ! We shall never

be rid of this troublesome Devil, till thou do come to Cha.in
him up.

But because the People of God, would willingly be told

whereabouts we are, with reference to the imuth and the

time of the Devil, you shall give me leave humbly to set

before you a few Conjectures.

The first Conjecture.

The Devils Eldest Son seems to be towards the Eml of

his last Half-time ; and if it be so, the Devils Whole-time,

cannot but be verv near its End.
It is a very scandalous

thing that any Protestant, should be at a loss where to find

the Anti-Christ.
But, we have a sufficient assurance, that

the Duration of Anti-Christ, is to be but for a Time, and

for Times, and for Haifa time ; that is for Twelve hundred
and Sixty Years.
And
indeed,
those Twelve Hundred

and Sixty Years, were the very Spott of Time left for the

Devil, and meant when
'tis here said, He has but a shoi^t

time.
Now,
I should have an easie time of
it,
if I were

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
71

never put upon an Harder Task, than
to produce what

might render it extreamly probable, that Antichrist entred

his last Half-time, or the
last Hundred and Fourscore

yeais of his Reign, at or soon after the celebrated Refor-
mation which began at the year 15 17 in the former century.

Indeed,
it
is veiy agreeable
to
see how Antichrist then

lost Half of his Empire
; and how that half which then

becaite Reformed, have been upon many accounts
little

more than Half-reformed.
But by this computation, we

must reeds be within a very few years of such a Mortifica-

tion to befal the See of Rome, as that Antichrist, who has

lately leen planting (what proves no more lasting than) a

Tabernacle in the Glorious Holy Mountain betiveen
the

Seas, must quickly, Come to his End, and none shall help
him.
So then, within a very little while, we shall see the

Devil stript of the grand, yea, the last,
Vehicle, wherein

he will be capable to abuse our World.
The Fires, with

which, That Beast
is to be consumed, will
so
singe the

Wings of the Devil
too, that he
shall no more
set the

Affairs of this world on Fire.
Yea, they shall both go into

the same Fire, to be tormented for ever and ever.

The Second Conjecture.

That which is, perhaps, the greatest Effect of the Devils

Wrath, seems to be in a manner at an end : and this would
make one hope that the Devils time cannot be far from its

end.
It is in Persecution, that the wrath of the Devil uses

to break forth, with
its greatest fury.
Now there want

not probabilities, that the last Persecution intended for the

Church of God, before the Advent of our Lord, has been

72
THE WONDERS OF

upon
it.
When we see the second Woe passing away, we

have a fair signal given unto us, That the last slaughter of
our Lord's
Witnesses
is over;
and then what
Quickly

follows 1
The next thing is, The Kingdoms of this World,

are become the Kingdoms of Our Lord, and of his Christ^

and then down goes the Kingdom of the Devil, so tht he

cannot any more come down upon
us.
Now, the Irre-

coverable and Irretrievable Humiliations that have lately

befallen the Turkish Power, are but so many Declarations

of the second
Woe passing away.
And the dealings of

God with the European parts of the world, at this day, do

further strengthen
this
our
expectation.
We do see, at

this hour a great Earth-quake all Europe over : tud we

shall
see,
that
this great Earthquake, and
these
great

Commotions, will but contribute unto the advancement of

our Lords
hitherto-depressed
Interests.
'Tis also to be

remark'd
that, a disposition
to recognize the Empire of

God over the Conscience of man, does now prevail more in

the world than formerly
;
and God from on High more

touches the Hearts of Princes and Rulers with an averse-

ness
to
Persecution.
'Tis
particularly
the unspeakable

happiness of the English Nation, to be under the Influences

of that excellent Queen, who could say, In as much as a
man cannot make himself believe what he will, why should

we Persecute men for not believing as we do?
I wish I

could see all good men of one mind;
but in the mean time

I pray,
let
them
however
love
one
another.
Words

worthy to be written
in Letters of Gold
! and by us the

more to be considered, because to one of Ours did that royal
Person
express
Her
self so
excellently,
so
obligingly.

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
73

When the late King James published
his Declaration for

Liberty of Conscience, a worthy Divine in the Church of

England, then studying the Revelation, saw cause upon
Revdational Grounds, to declare himself in such words as

these,
Whatsoever
others may intend or design by
this

Liberty of Conscience, I cannot believe, that it will ever be

recalled in England, as long as the World stands.
And

you know how miraculously the Earth-quake which then

immediately came upon the Kingdom, has established that

Liberty !
But that which exceeds all the tendencies this

way,
is,
the
dispensation
of God
at
this Day,
towards

the blessed Vaudois.
Those renowned IValdenses, which

were a sort
of Root unto
all Protestant
Churches, were

never dissipated, by all the Persecutions of many Ages, till

within these few years, the French King and the Duke of

Savoy leagued for their dissipation.
But just Three years

and a half after the scattering of that holy people, to the

surprise of all the World, Spirit of life from God is come

into them ; and having with a thousand Miracles repossessed
themselves of their antient Seats, their hot Persecutor is

become their great Protector.
Whereupon the reflection

of the worthy person, that writes the story is, The Churches

o/Tiemont, being the Root oftJie Protestant Churches, they
have been thefirst established; the Churches of'oilier places^

being but the Branches, shall
be established in due time.

God will deliver them speedily, He has already delivered

the Mother, and He will not long lea ve the Daughter behind:
He will finish what he has gloriously begun!

74
THE WONDERS OF

The Third Conjecture.

There is a little room for hope, that the great wrath of

the Devil, will not prove the present mine of our poor New-

England in particular.
I believe, there never was a poor

Plantation, more pursued by the wrath of the Devil, than

our poor New-England; and that which makes our con-

dition very much the more deplorable is, that the wrath of

the great God Himself, at the same time also presses hard

upon us.
It was a rousing alarm
to the Devil, when a

great Company of English Protestants and Puritans, came

to erect Evangelical Churches, in a corner of the World,
where he had reign 'd without any coutroul for many Ages ;
and
it
is a vexing Eye-sore to the Devil, that our Lord

Christ should be known, and own'd, and preached in this

howling
Wilderness.
Wherefor he has
left no Stone un-

turned, that so he might undermine
his Plantation, and

force us out of our Country.

First, The Indian Poivawes, used all their Sorceries to

molest the
first Planters here; but God said unto them,

Touch them not !
Then, Seducing Spirits came to root in

this Vineyard, but God so rated them
off, that they have

not prevail'd much farther than the Edges
of our Land.

After this, we have had a continual blast upon some of our

principal
Grain,
annually diminishing a vast part of our

ordinary Food.
Herewithal, wasting Sicknesses, especially

Burning
and Mortal Agues,
have
Shot
the Arrows
of

Death
in
at our Windows.
Next, we have had many

Adversaries
of our own Language, who have been
per-

petually assaying to deprive us of those English Liberties,

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
75

in the encouragement whereof these Territories have been

settled.
As
if this had not been enough; The Taivnies

among whom we came, have watered our
Soil
with
the

Blood of many Hundreds of our Inhabitants.
Desolating

Fires also have many times laid the chief Treasure of the

whole Province in Ashes.
As for Losses by Sea, they have

been miiltiply'd upon us
: and particularly in the present

French War, the whole English Nation have observ'd that

no part of the Nation
has
proportionably had
so many

Vessels
taken,
as
our poor New-England.
Besides all

which, now at last the Devils
are (if I may so speak) in

Person come down upon us with such a Wrath, as is justly

much, and will quickly be more, the Astonishment of the

World.
Alas, I may sigh over this "Wilderness, as Moses

did over his, in Psal. 90.
7.
9. We are consumed by thine

Anger, and by thy Wrath we are troubled: All our days
arepassed away in thy Wrath.
And I may add this unto

it, The
Wrath of the Devil
too has been troubling and

spvnding of us, all our days.

But what will become of this poor New-England after

all?
Shall we sink, expire, perish, before the short time of

the Devil shall be finished?
I must confess, That when I

consider the lamentable Unfruitfulness of men, among us,
under
as powerful and
perspicuous Dispensations of the

Gospel, as
are
in
the World;
and when
I
consider the

declining state of the Pmver of Godliness in our Churches,
with the most horrible Indisposition that perhaps ever was,

to recover out of this declension ; I cannot but Fear lest it

comes to this, and lest an Asiatic Removal of Candlesticks

come upon us.
But upon some other Accounts, I would

76
THE WONDERS OF

fain hope
otherwise; and I
will give you
therefore
the

opportunity to try what Inferences may be drawn from these

probable Prognostications.

I say, First, That surely, America's Fate, must at the

long run
include New-England*
in
it.
What was
the

design of our God, in bringing over so many Europeans

hither of later years?
Of what use or state will America

be, when the Kingdom of God shall come?
If it must all

be the Devils
propriety, while the saved Nations of the

other Hemisphere shall be Walking in
the Light of the

New Jerusalem, Our New-England has then,
'tis
likely,

done all that it was erected for.
But if God have a purpose

to make here a seat for any of those glorious things which

are spoken of thee,
thou City of God; then even thou,

New-England, art within a very
little while of better

days than ever yet have dawn'd upon thee.

I say,
Secondly, That
tho'
there be
very Threatning

Symptoms on America, yet there are some hopeful ones.

1 confess, when one thinks upon the crying Barbarities with

which the most of those Europeans that have Peopled this
New world, became
the Masters of it;
it looks but Omi-

nously.
When one
lso thinks how much the way of living

in many parts of America,
is utterly inconsistent with the

very
Essentials of Christianity; yea, how much
Injury

and
Violence
is
therein
done to Humanity it self;
it is

enough to damp the Hopes
of the
most Sanguine Com-

plexion.
And the Frown of Heaven which
has
hitherto

been upon Attempts of better Gospellizing the Plantations,

considered, will but increase the Damp.
Nevertheless, on

the other side, what shall be said of all the Promises, That

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
77

our Lord Jesus Christ shall have the uttermostparts of the
Earth for his Possession? and of all the Prophecies, That

All the ends of the Earth shall remember and turn unto

the Lord?
Or does
it look agreeably, That such a rich

quarter of the World, equal in some regards to all the rest,
should never be out
of the Devils hands,
from the
first

Inhabitation unto the last Dissolution of it? No sure; why
may not the last be the first? and the Sun of Righteous-
ness come
to shine
brightest,
in Climates which
it
rose

latest upon!

I say, Thirdly, That as it fares with Old England, so

it will be most
likely to
fare with New-England.
For

which cause, by the way, there may be more of the Divine

Favour in the present Circumstances of our dependence on

England^ than we are
well aware
of.
This is very sure,

if matters go
ill with our Mother,
her
poor American

Daughter here, must feel it; nor could our former Happy
Settlement have hindred our sympathy inthatUnhappiness.
But if matters go
Well in the Three Kingdoms ; as long

as God shall bless the English Nation, with Rulers that

shall encourage Piety, Honesty, Industry, in their Subjects,
and that shall cast a Benign Aspect upon the Interests of

our Glorious Gospel, Abroad as" well as at Home; so long,

Neio-England will at least keep its head above water : and

so much the more, for our comfortable Settlement in such

a Form as we are now cast into.
Unless there should be

any
singular,
destroying,
Topical Plagues, whereby an

offended God should at last make us Rise;
But, Alas,

Lord, wliat other Hive hast thou provided for us !

I say, Fourthly, That the Elder England will certainly

78
THE JTOXDERS OF

and speedily be Visited with the ancient loving kindness of

God.
When one
sees, how
strangely the
Curse
of our

Joshua, has fallen upon the Persons and Houses of them

that have attempted the Rebuilding of the Old Romish

Jericho, which has there been so far demolished, they cannot

but say, That the Reformation
there,
shall not only be

maintained, but
also pursued, proceeded, perfected
;
and

that God will shortly there have a New Jerusalem.
Or,

Let a Man
in
his thoughts run
over but the
series
of

amazing Providences towards the English Nation for the

last Thirty Years : Let him
reflect, how many Plots for

the ruine
of the Nation, have been strangely discovered
:

yea, how very unaccountably those very Persons, yea,
I

may also say, that those very Methods which were intended

for the tools of that ruine, have become the instruments or

occasions
of Deliverances. A man cannot but
say upon

these Reflections, as the Wife of Manoah once prudently

expressed her self, If the Lord ivere pleased to have De-

stroyed
its, He would not have shew'd us all these things.

Indeed, It is not unlikely, that the Enemies of the English

Nation, may yet provoke such a Shake unto
it, as may

perhaps
exceed any that
has
hitherto been undergone
:

the Lord prevent
the Machinations of his Adversaries
!

But that shake will usher in the most glorious Times that

ever arose upon the English Horizon.
As for the French

Cloud which hangs over England, tho' it be like to Rain

showers of Blood upon a Nation, where the Blood of the

Blessed Jesus has been too much treated
as an Unholy

Thing ; yet I believe God will shortly scatter it
: and my

belief is grounded upon a bottom that will bear it.
If that

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
79

overgrown French Leviathan should accomplish any thiKg

like a Conquest of England, what could there be to hinder

him from the Universal Empire of the West ?
But
the

Visions
of the Western World,
in
the
Views both
of

Daniel and of John, do assure us, that whatever Monarch,

shall while the Papacy continues go to swallow up the Ten

Kings which received their Power upon the
Fall of the

Western Empire, he must miscarry in the Attempt.
The

French Phcetons Epitaph seems written hi that, Sure Word

of Prophecy.

[Since the making of this Conjecture, there
are arriv'd

unto us, the News of a Victory ofetain'd by the English

over the French, which further confirms our Conjecture
;

and causes us to sing, Pharaohs CJiariots, and his Hosts,
has the Lord cast down into the Sea ; Thy right-hand has

dashed in pieces the Enemy /]

Now, In
the Salvation of England,
the
Plantations

cannot but Rejoyce, and New-England, also will be Glad.

But so much for our Corollaries, I hasten to the main

thing designed for your entertainment.
And that
is,

AN HORTATORY AND NECESSARY ADDRESS,

TO A COUNTRY NOW EXTRAORDINARILY ALARUJl'D

BY THE WRATH OF THE DEVIL.

'TIS THIS,

LET

us now make a good and a right use of the prodigi-

our descent which the Devil in Great Wrath is at this

day making upon our Land.
Upon the Death of a Great

80
THE WONDERS OF

Man once, an Orator call'd the Town together, crying out,
Concurrite
Gives, Dllapsa sunt vestra Moenia I that
is,

Gome together, Neighbours, your Town- Walls are fallen
down!
But such is the descent of the Devil at this day

upon our selves, that I may truly tell you, The Walls of
the whole World are broken down!
The usual Walls of

defence about mankind have such a Gap made in them,
that the very Devils are broke in upon us, to seduce the

Souls, torment the Bodies, sully the Credits, and consume

the Estates of our Neighbours, with
Impressions both as

real and
as furious, as if the Invisible World were
be-

coming Incarnate, on purpose for the vexing of us.
And

what use ought now to be made of so tremendous a dis-

pensation ? We are engaged in a Fast this day ; but shall
we try to fetch Meat out of the Eater, and make the Lion

to afford some Hony for our Souls ?

That the Devil is come down unto us with great Wrath,

we find, we feel, we now deplore.
In many ways, for many

years hath the Devil been assaying to Extirpate the King-
dom of our Lord Jesus here.
New-England may complain

of the Devil, as in Psal. 129.
1, 2. Many a time have they

afflicted me, {from iny Youth, may New-England now say ;
Many a time have they afflicted me from my Youth; yet

they have not prevailed against me.
But now there is a

more than ordinary affliction, with which the Devil is Galling

of us
: and such an one as is indeed Unparallelable.
The

things
confessed by
Witches, and the things endured by

Others,
laid together, amount unto
this
account
of our

Affliction.
The Devil, Exhibiting himself ordinarily as a

small Black man,
has decoy'd a fearful knot of proud,

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
81

froward, ignorant, envious and malicious creatures, to lift

themselves in his horrid Service, by entring their Names

in a Book by him tendred unto them.
These
Witches,

whereof above a Score have now Confessed, and shown their

Deeds, and some
are now tormented by the
Devils, for

Confessing,
have met
in
Hellish Randezvouzes, wherein

the
Confessors do
say,
they
have had
their Diabolical

Sacraments, imitating the Baptism and the Supper of our

Lord.
In
these
hellish
meetings,
these Monsters have

associated themselves to do no less a thing than, To destroy

the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, in these parts of

the World; and in order hereunto, First they each of them

have their Spectres, or
Devils, commission'd by them, &

representing of them, to be the Engines of their Malice.

By these wicked Spectres, they seize poor people about the

Country, with various & bloudy Torments ; and of those

evidently Preternatural torments there are some have dy'd.

They have bewitched some, even so far as to make Self-

destroyers : and others are in many Towns here and there

languishing under
their Evil hands.
The people thus

afflicted,
are miserably scratched and bitten, so that the

Marks are most visible to
all the World, but the causes

utterly invisible ; and the same
Invisible Furies do most

visibly stick Pins into the bodies of the afflicted, and scale

them, and hideously distort, and disjoint all their members,

besides a thousand other sorts of Plagues beyond these of

any
natural diseases which they give unto them.
Yea,

they sometimes drag the poor people out of their chambers,
and
carry them
over Trees and
Hills,
for divers miles

together.
A large part of the persons tortured by these

G

82
THE WONDEES OF

Diabolical Spectres, are horribly tempted by them, some-

times with fair promises, and sometimes with hard tbreat-

irings, but always with
felt miseries,
to
sign the Devils

Laws in a Spectral Book laid before them ; which two or

three of these poor Sufferers, being by their tiresome suffer-

ings overcome to do, they have immediately been released

from all their miseries, and they appear'd
in Spectre then

to Torture those that were before their Fellow-Sufferers.
The Witches which by their covenant with the Devil, are

become Owners of Spectres, are oftentimes by their own

Spectres required and compelled to give their consent, for

the molestation of some, which they had no mind otherwise

to fall upon ; and cruel depredations are then made upon
the Vicinage.
In the Prosecution of these Witchcrafts,

among a thousand other unaccountable things, the Spectres
have an odd faculty of cloathing the most substantial and

corporeal Instruments of Torture, with Invisibility, while

the wounds thereby given have been the most palpable

things in the World
;
so that the Sufferers assaulted with

Instruments
of Iron, wholly unseen
to the
standers
by,

though,
to
their
cost,
seen by
themselves,
have, upon

snatching, wrested
the
Instruments out of the Spectres

hands, and every one has then immediately not only beheld,
but handled, an Iron Instrument taken by a Devil from a

Neighbour.
These wicked Spectres have proceeded so far,

as to steal several quantities of Mony from divers people, part

of which Money,
has,
before
sufficient
Spectators,
been

dropt out of the Air into the Hands of the Sufferers, while

the Spectres have been
urging them
to
subscribe
their

Covenant with Death. In such extravagant ways have these

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
83

Wretches propounded, the Dragooning of as many as they

c;m,
in
their own
Combination, and
the Destroying of

others, with
lingring,
spreading, deadly diseases ;
till our

Gountrey should at last become too hot for us.
Among the

Ghastly Instances of the success which those Bloody Witches

have had, we have seen even some of their own Children,

so dedicated unto the Devil, that in their Infancy,
it
is

found, the Imps have sucked them, and rendred them Ve-

nemous to a Prodigy.
We have also seen the Devils first

batteries upon the Town, where the first Church of our

Lord
in
this Colony was gathered, producing those
dis-

tractions, which have almost ruin'd the Town.
We have

seen likewise the Plague reaching afterwards into other
Towns far and near, where the Houses of good Men have

the Devils filling of them with terrible Vexations
!

This is the Descent, which, it seems, the Devil has now

made upon us.
But that which makes this Descent the

more formidable, is
; The multitude and quality of Persons

accused of an interest in this Witchcraft, by the Efficacy of

the Spectres which take their Name and shape upon them ;

causing veiy many good and wise Men to fear, That many

innocent, yea, and some vertuous persons, are by the Devils

in this matter, imposed upon ; That the Devils have obtain'd

the power, to take on them the likeness of harmless people,
and in that likeness to afflict other people, and be so abused

by Prestigious Daemons, that upon their look or touch, the

afflicted
shall
be
odly
affected.
Arguments
from
the

Providence of God, on the one side, and from our Charity
towards Man on the other
side, have made this now to

become a most agitated
Controversie among us.
There

84
THE WONDERS OF

is an Agony produced
in
the Minds
of Men,
lest
the

Devil should sham us with
Devices,
of perhaps
a
finer

Thred, than was ever yet practised upon the World.
The

whole business
is become hereupon so Snarled, and the

determination of the Question oneway or another, so dismal,

that our Honourable Judges have a Room forJehoshaphat's

Exclamation, We know not what to do I
They have used,

as Judges have heretofore done, the Spectral Evidences, to

introduce
their
further
Enquiries
into the Lives of the

persons accused ; and they have thereupon, by the wonder-

ful Providence of God, been so strengthened with other

evidences, that some of the Witch Gang have been fairly
Executed.
But what shall be done, as to those against

whom the evidence is chiefly founded
in the dark world ?

Here they do solemnly demand our Addresses to the Father

of Lights, on their behalf.
But
in
the mean time, the

Devil improves the Darkness of this Affair, to push us into

a Blind Mans Buffet, and we are even ready to be sinfully,

yea, hotly, and madly, mauling one another in the dark.

The consequence of these things, every considerate Man

trembles at ; and the more, because the frequent cheats of

Passion, and Rumour, do precipitate so many, that I wish

I could say, The most were considerate.

But that which carries on theformidablenessof our Trials,

unto that which may be called, A wrath unto the
utter-

most, is this
:
It is not without the wrath of the Almighty

God himself, that the Devil is permitted thus to come down

upon us in wrath.
It was said, in Isa.
9.
19. Through

the wrath of the Lord ofHosts, the Land is darkned.
Our

Land
is darkned indeed ;
since the Powers of Darkness

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
85

are turned in upon us
:
'tis a dark time, yea a black night

indeed, now the Ty-dogs of the Pit are abroad among us
:

but, It is through the wrath of the Lord of Hosts !
Inas-

much as the Fire-brands of Hell it
self are used for the

scorching of us, with cause enough may we cry out, What

means the heat of this anger ?
Blessed Lord
!
Are all the

other Instruments
of thy Vengeance,
too good
for
the

chastisement of such transgressors as we are 1
Must the

very Devils be
sent
out
of Their own place, to be
our

Troublers
:
Must we be lash'd with Scorpions, fetch'd from

the Place of Torment ?
Must this Wilderness be made a

Receptacle for the Dragons of the Wilderness ?
If a Lap-

land should nourish in
it vast numbers, the successors of

the old Biarmi, who can with looks or words bewitch other

people, or sell Winds to Marriners, and have their Familiar

Spirits which they bequeath to their Children when they

die, and by their Enchanted Kettle-Drums can learn things
done a Thousand Leagues off ; If a Swedeland should afford

a Village, where some scores of Haggs, may not only have

their Meetings with Familiar
Spirits, but also by their

Enchantments drag many scores
of poor
children out
of

their Bed-chambers, to be spoiled at those Meetings
;
This

were not altogether a matter of so much wonder
! But that

New-England should this way be harassed
!
They are not

CJialdeans, that Bitter and Hasty Nation, but they are,

BitterandBurning Devils ; They are not Swarthy Indians,
but they
are Sooty Devils ;
that are
let loose upon us.

Ah, Poor New-England!
Must the plague of Old ^Egypt

come upon thee ?
Whereof we read in Psal. 78. 49.
He

cast upon them
the fierceness of his Anger,
Wrath, and

86
THE WONDERS OF

Indignation, and Trouble, by sending Evil Angels among
hem.
What,
what must next be looked forl
Must

that which is there next mentioned, be next encountered 1
He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life

over to the Pestilence.
For my part, when I consider what

Melancthon says, in one of his
Epistles, That these Dia-

bolical Spectacles are often Prodigies; andwhen I consider,
how often people have been by Spectres called upon, just

before their Deaths ;
I am verily afraid, lest some wasting

Mortality be among the things, which this Plague is the

Forerunner of.
I pray God prevent it
!

But now, What shall we do ?

I.
Let the Devils coming down in great wrath upon us,

cause
us
to come down in great grief before the Lord.

We may truly and sadly say, We are brought very low!
Low indeed, when the Serpents of the dust, are crawling
and coyling about us, and Insulting over us.
May we not

say, We are in the very belly of Hell, when Hell it self

is feeding upon us ?
But how Low is that
!
let us then

most penitently lay our selves very Low before the God of

Heaven, who
has thus Abased
us.
When
a Truculent

Nero, a Devil of a Man, was turned in upon the World, it

was
said, in
1
Pet.
5.
6. Humble your
selves under the

mighty hand of God.
How much more now ought we to

humble our selves under that MightyHand of that God who

indeed has the Devil in a Chain, but has horribly length-
ened out the Chain !
When the old people of God heard

any Blasphemies,
tearing
of
his
Ever-Blessed Name
to

pieces, they were to Rend their Cloaths at what they heard.

I am sure that we have cause to Rend our Hearts this Day,

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
87

when we see what an High Treason has been committed

against
the most high God, by the Witchcrafts
in our

Neighbourhood. We may say ; and shall we not be humbled
when we say it ? We liave seen an horrible thing done in

our Land I
'tis a most humbling thing, to think, that

ever there should be such an abomination among us, as for

a crue of humane race, to renounce their Maker, and to

unite with the Devil, for the troubling of mankind, and for

People
to
be,
(as
is by some
confess'd) Baptized by a

Fiend using this form upon them, Thou art mine, and I

have a full power over thee! afterwards communicating in

an
Hellish Bread, and Wine, by that Fiend administred

unto them.
It was said in Deut.
18.
10,
11,
12.
There

s/iall not be found among you an Inchanter, or a Witch,
or a CJiarmer, or a Consulter with Familiar Spirits, or a

Wizzard, or a Necromancer; For all that do these things
arean Abomination to the Lord,and because of'these Abomi-

nations, the Lord thy God doth drive them out before thee.

That New-England now should have these Abominations

in it, yea, that some of no mean Profession, should be found

guilty of them
:
Alas, what Humiliations are we all hereby

obliged unto ?
'tis a Defiled Land, wherein we live ;
Let

us be humbled for these Defiling Abominations, lest we be

driven out of our Land.
It's a very humbling thing to

think, what reproaches will be cast upon us, for this matter,
among The Daughters of the Philistines.
Indeed, enough

might easily be said for the vindication of this Country
from the Singularity of this matter, by ripping up, what

has been discovered in others.
Great Britain alone, and

this also in our days of Greatest Light, has had that in
it,

88
THE WONDERS OF

which may divert the Calumnies of an ill-natured World,
from centring here.
They are words of the Devout Bishop

Hall, Satans prevalency in this Age, is most clear in the

marvellous Number of Witches, abounding in all places.
NowHundreds are discovered in one Shire; and, ifFame

Deceives us not, in a
Village of Fourteen Houses in the

North, are found so many of this Damned Brood.
Yea,

and those of both Sexes, who have professed much Know-

ledge, Holiness, and Devotion, are drawn into this Damn-

able Practice.
I suppose the Doctor in the first of those

Passages, may refer to what happened
in the Year 1645.

When so many Vassals of the Devil were Detected, that

there were Thirty try'd at one time, whereas about four-

teen were Hang'd, and an Hundred more detained in the

Prisons of Suffolk and Essex.
Among other things which

many of these Acknowledged, one was, That they were to

undergo certain Punishments, if they did not such and such

Hurts, as were
appointed
them.
And, among the rest

that were then Executed, there was an Old Parson, called

Lowis, who
confessed, That he had a
couple
of Imps,

whereof one was always putting him upon the doing of

Mischief; Once pa^icularly, that Imp calling for his Con-

sent so to do, went immediately and Sunk a Ship, then

under Sail.
I pray, let not New-England become of an

Unsavoury and a Sulphurous Kesentment in the Opinion

of the World abroad, for the Doleful things which are now

fallen out among us, while there are such Histories of other

places abroad in the World.
Nevertheless, I am sure that

we,
the
People
of New-England, have cause enough to

Humble
our
selves under
our most Humbling Circum-

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
89

stances.
"We must no more be Haughty, because of the

Lords Holy Mountain among us; No it becomes us rather

to be, Humble, because we have been such an Habitation of

Unholy Devils!

II.
Since the Devil is come down in great wrath upon

us, let not us in our great wrath against one another provide
a Lodging for him.
It was a most wholesome caution, in

Eph. 4. 26. 27. Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath :

Neither give place to the Devil.
The Devil is come down

to see what Quarter he shall find among us
: And
if his

coming down, do now fill us with wrath against one another,
and if between the cause of the Sufferers on one hand, and

the cause of the Suspected on t'other, we carry things to

such extreams of Passion as are now gaining upon us, the

Devil will Bless himself, to find such a convenient Lodging

as we shall therein afford unto him.
And it may be that

the wrath which we have had against one another has had

more than a little influence upon the coming down of the

Devil
in that wrath which now amazes us.
Have not

many of us been Devils one unto another for Slanderings,

for Backbitings, for Animosities ?
For
this, among other

causes, perhaps, God has permitted the Devils to be worry-

ing, as they now are, among us.
But
it
is high time to

leave
off
all Devilism, when the Devil himself is falling

upon us
: And
it
is no time for us to be Censuring and

Reviling one another, with a Devilish wrath, when the

wrath of the Devil is annoying of us.
The way for us to

out-wit the Devil, in the
Wiles with which he now Vexes

us, would be for us to joyn as one man in our cries to God,

for the Directing, and Issuing of this Thorny Business
;

90
THE WONDERS OF

but if we do not Lift up our Hands to Heaven, without

Wrath, we cannot then do it without Doubt, of speeding

in it.
I am ashamed when I read French Authors giving

this Character of Englishmen [Us se haissent Les uns les

autres, & sont en Division ContinuelleJ]
They hate one

another, and are always Quarrelling one with another.
And
I
shall be much more ashamed,
if
it become
the

Character of New-Englanders ; which is indeed what the

Devil would have.
Satan would make
us
bruise
one

another, by breaking of the Peace among us ;
but
let us

disappoint
him.
We read
of a
thing
that sometimes

happens to the Devil, when he is foaming with his Wrath,

in Mar.
12. 43. The unclean Spirit seeks rest, andjinds

none.
But we give
rest unto
the Devil, by wrath one

against another.
If we would lay aside all fierceness, and

keenness, in the disputes which the Devil has raised among
us
; and if we would use to one another none but the soft

Answers, which turn away wrath:
I should hope that we

might light upon such Counsels, as would quickly Extricate

us out of our Labyrinths.
But the old Incendiary of the

world,
is corne from Hell, with Sparks of Hell-Fire flash-

ing on every side of him
; and we make our selves Tynder

to the Sparks.
When the Emperour Henry III. kept the

Feast of Pentecost, at the
City Mentz, there arose a dis-

sension among some of the people there, which came from

words to blows, and at last it passed on to the shedding of

Blood.
After the Tumult was
over, when they came
to

that clause in their Devotions, Thou hast made this day
Glorious ; the Devil to the unexpressible Terrour of that

vast Assembly, made the Temple Ring with that Outcry,

TEE INVISIBLE WORLD.
91

But I have made this Day Quarrelsome ! We are truly
come into a day, which by being well managed might be

very
Glorious,
for the exterminating
of those Accursed

things, which have hitherto been the
Clogs
of our Pros-

perity ; but if we make
this day Quarrelsome, thro' any

Raging Confidences, Alas,
Lord, my Flesh Tremblesfor

Fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.
Eras-

mus, among other Historians,
tells us, that at a Town in

Germany, a Witch
or Devil, appeared on
the Top
of a

Chimney, Threatning to set
the Town on Fire : And
at

length, Scattering a Pot of Ashes abroad, the Town was

presently and horribly Burnt unto the Ground.
Methinks,

I see the Spectres, from the Top of the Chimneys to the

Northward, threatning to scatter Fire, about the Countrey ;
but let us quench that Fire, by the most amicable Corres-

pondencies

:
Lest, as the Spectres, have, they say, already

most Literally burnt some of our Dwellings, there do come

forth a further Fire from the BramUes of Hell, which may
more terribly Devour us.
Let us not be like a Troubled

House, altho' we are so much haunted by the Devils.
Let

our Long suffering be a well-placed piece of Armour, about

us, against the Fiery Darts of the wicked ones.
History

informs us, That so long ago, as the year 858, a certain Pes-

tilent and Malignant sort oi&Dwmon, molested Caumont in

Germany with all sorts of methods to stir up strife among

the Citizens. He uttered Prophecies, he detected Villanies,
he branded people with all kinds of Infamies.
He incensed

the Neighbourhood against one Man
particularly, as the

cause of all the mischiefs
: who yet proved himself innocent.

He threw stones at the Inhabitants, and at length burnt

92
THE WONDERS OF

their Habitations, till the Commission of the Daemon could

go no
further.
I
say, Let us be
well aware
lest such

Daemons do Come hither also.

III. Inasmuch
as the Devil
is come down
in Great

Wrath, we had need Labour, with all the Care and Speed
we can to Divert the Great Wrath of Heaven from coming

at the same time upon us.
The God of Heaven has with

long and loud Admonitions, been calling us to a Reforma-

tion of our Provoking Evils, as the only way to avoid that
Wrath of His, which does not only Threaten but Consume

us.
'Tis because we have been Deaf to those Calls that

we are now by a provoked God, laid open to the Wrath of

the Devil himself.
It is said in Pr. 16. 17. When a mans

ways please the Lord, he maketh even his Enemies to be at

peace with him.
The Devil
is our grand Enemy ; and

tho' we would not be at peace with him, yet we would be

at peace from him, that
is, we would have him unable to

disquiet our peace.
But inasmuch as the wrath which we

endure from this Enemy, will allow us no peace, we may

be sure, our ways liave not pleased the Lord.
It is because

we have broken the hedge of Gods Precepts, that the hedge

of Gods Providence is not so entire as it uses to be about

us ; but Serpents are biting of us.
let us then set our

selves to make our peace with our God, whom we have

displeased by our iniquities
: and let us not imagine that

we can encounter the Wrath of the Devil, while there
is

the Wrath of God Almighty to set that Mastiff upon us.

REFORMATION
!
REFORMATION
!
has been the repeated

Cry of all the Judgments that have hitherto been upon us ;

because we have been as deaf Adders thereunto, the Adders

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
93

of the Infernal Pit are now hissing about us.
At length,

as it was of old said, Luke 16. 30. If one went unto them

from the dead, they ivill repent; even so, there are some

come unto us from the Damned.
The great God has loosed

the Bars of the Pit, so that many damned Spirits are come

in among
us, to make us repent
of our Misdemeanours.

The means which the Lord had formerly employ'd for our

awakening, were such, that he might well have said, What

could I have done more? and yet
after
all, he has done

more, in some regards, than was ever done for the awaken-

ing of any People in the World.
The
things now done

to awaken our Enquiries after our provoking Evils, and our

endeavours to Reform those Evils, are most extraordinary

things ;
for which cause I would freely speak it, if we now

do not some extraordinary things in returning to God ;
we are the most incurable, and I wish
it be not quickly

said, the most miserable People under the Sun.
Believe

me, 'tis a time for all people to do something extraordinary,
in searching and trying of their ways, and in turning to

the Lord.
It is at an extraordinary rate of Circumspec-

tion and Spiritual mindedness, that we should
all now

maintain a walk with God.
At such a time as this ought

Magistrates to do something extraordinary in promoting

of what is laudable, and
in
restraining and chastising of

Evil Doers.
At such a time as this ought Ministers to do

something extraordinary in pulling the Souls of men out

of the Snares of the Devil, not only by publick Preaching,
but by personal Visits and Counsels, from house to house.
At such a time as
this ought Churches to do something

extraordinary,
in renewing of their Covenants, and
in

94
THE WONDERS OF

rernembring, and reviving the Obligations
of what they

have renewed.
Some admirable Designs about the Refor-

mation of Manners, have lately been on foot in the English

Nation, in pursuance
of the most
excellent Admonitions

which have been
given
for
it,
by
the
Letters of Their

Majesties.
Besides
the
vigorous
Agreements
of
the

Justices here and there in the Kingdom, assisted by godly
Gentlemen and Informers, to Execute the Laws upon pro-

phane Offenders;
there
has been
started a Proposal
for

the
well-affected
people
in
every
Parish,
to
enter
into

orderly Societies, whereof every Member shall bind himself,
not only to avoid Prophaneness in himself, but also accord-

ing unto to their Place, to do their utmost in first Reproving;

and,
if it must be
so, then Exposing, and so Punishing,

as the Law directs, for others that shall be guilty.
It has

been observed, that the English Nation has had some of its

greatest Successes, upon some special and
signal Actions

this way; and a discouragement given under Legal Pro-

ceedings of this kind, must needs be very exercising to the

Wise that observe these things.
But,
why
should not

New-England be the most forward
part of the English

Nation in such Reformations?
Methinks I hear the Lord

from
Heaven
saying
over
us,
that my People had

hearkened unto me ; then I should soon have subdued the

Devils, as well as their other Enemies!
There have been

some feeble Essays towards Reformation of late
in our

Churches;
but, I pray, what comes of them? Do we stay

till the Storm of his Wrath be over ? Nay, let us be doing
what we can, as fast as we can, to divert the Storm.
The

Devils having broke
in upon
our World, there
is great

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
95

asking, Who is it tliat has brought them in ? And many
do by Spectral Exhibitions come to be cry'd out upon.
I

hope in Gods time it will be found, that among those that

are thus cry'd out upon, there are persons yet Clear from

the great Transgression ; but indeed,
all the Unreformed

among
us, may justly be cry'd out upon, as having too

much of an hand in letting of the Devils into our Borders ;

'tis our Worldliness, our Formality, our
Sensuality, and

our Iniquity that has help'd this letting of the Devils in
.

let us then at
last, consider our ways.
Tis a strange

passage recorded by Mr. Clark in the Life of his Father,
That the People of his Parish, refusing to be Reclaimed

from their Sabbath breaking, by all the zealous Testimonies

which that good Man bore against it
;
at last, on a night

after the people had retired home from a Revelling Propha-

nation of the Lords Day, there was heard a great Noise, with

rattling of Chains up and down the Town, and an horrid

Scent of Brimstone fill'd the Neighbourhood.
Upon which

the guilty Consciences of the Wretches told them, the Devil

was come to fetch them away
;
and
it
so
terrifi'd them,

that an Eminent Reformation follow'd the Sermons which

that Man of God Preached thereupon.
Behold, Sinners,

behold and wonder, lest you perish: the very Devils are

walking about our Streets, with lengthened Chains, making
a dreadful Noise in our Ears, and Brimstone even without

a Metaphor,
is making an hellish and horrid stench in our

Nostrils.
I pray leave off
all those things whereof your

guilty Consciences may now accuse you, lest these Devils

do yet more
direfully fall upon you.
Reformation is at

this time our only Preservation.

THE WONDERS OF

IV. When the Devil is come down in great Wrath, let

every great
Vice which may have a more particular ten-

dency to make us a Prey unto that Wrath, come into a

due discredit with us.
It is the general Concession of all

men, who are not become too Unreasonable
for common

Conversation, that the Invitation of Witchcrafts is the thing

that has now introduced the Devil into the midst of us.
I

say then, let not only all Witchcrafts be duly abominated

with us, but also let us be duly watchful against all the Steps

leading thereunto.
There are lesser Sorceries which they

say, are too frequent
in our Land.
As it was said in 2

King.
17.
9. The Children of Israel did secretly those

things that luere not right, against the Lord their God.
So

'tis to be feared, the Children ofNew-England have secretly
done many things that have been pleasing to the Devil.

They say, that in some Towns it has been an usual thing

for People to cure Hurts with Spells, or to use detestable

Conjurations, with Sieves, Keys, and Pease, and Nails, and

Horse-shoes, and I know not what other Implements, to

learn the things for which they have a forbidden, and an

impious Curiosity.
'Tis in the Devils Name, that such

things are done
; and in Gods Name I do this day charge

them, as vile Impieties.
By these Courses 'tis, that People

play upon The Hole of the Asp, till that cruelly venemous

Asp has pull'd many of them into the deep Hole of Witch-

craft it self.
It has been acknowledged by some who have

sunk the deepest into this horrible Pit, that they began at

these little Witchcrafts ; on which
'tis pity but the Laws

of the English nation, whereby the incorrigible repetition

of those Tricks,
is made Felony, were severely Executed.

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
97

From the like sinful Curiosity it
is, that the Prognostica-

tions
of Judicial Astrology, are so injudiciously regarded

by multitudes among us ; and altho' the Jugling Astrologers
do
scarce ever
hit
right,
except
it be
in
such Weighty

Judgments, forsooth, as that many Old men will die such

a year, and that there will be many Losses
felt by some

that venture to Sea, and that there will be much Lying and

Cheating in the World ; yet their foolish Admirers will not

be perswaded but that the Innocent Stars have been con-

cern'd in these Events.
It is a disgrace to the English

Nation, that the Pamphlets of such idle, futil, trifling Star-

gazers
are
so much
considered;
and
the
Countenance

hereby given to a Study, wherein at
last,
all
is done by

Impulse, if any thing be done to any purpose at all, is not

a little perillous to the Souls of Men.
It is (a Science, I

dare not call
it, but) a Juggle, whereof the Learned Hall

well
says, It
is presumptuous and unwarrantable, and

cry'd ever down by Councils and Fathers, as unlawful, as

that which lies in the mid-way between Magick and Im-

posture, and partakes not a little of both.
Men consult

the Aspects of Planets, whose Northern or Southern motions

receive denominations from a
Coelestial Dragon,
till the

Infernal Dragon
at length insinuate
into
them, with a

Poison of Witchcraft that can't be cured.
Has there not

;dso been a world of discontent
in
our Borders?
'Tis no

wonder, that the fiery Serpents are so Stinging of us ; We

have been a most Murmuring Generation.
It is not Irra-

tional, to ascribe the late Stupendious growth of Witches

among us, partly to the bitter discontents which Affliction

and Poverty has
fill'd us with
:
it
is inconceivable, what

H

98
THE WONDERS OF

advantage the Devil gains over men, by discontent.
More-

over, the Sin of Unbelief may be reckoned as perhaps the

chief Crime
of our Land.
We are told, God swears in

wrath, against them that believe not; and what follows then

but this, That the Devil comes unto them in ivrath?
Never

were the offers of the Gospel, more freely tendered, or more

basely despised, among any People under the whole Cope
of Heaven, than in this N. E.
Seems it at all marvellous

unto
us,
that the Devil should get such
footing in our

Country

?
Why, 'tis because the Saviour has been slighted

here, perhaps more than any where.
The Blessed Lord

Jesus Christ has been profering to us, Grace, and Glory,
and every good thing, and been alluring of us to Accept of

Him, with such Terms as these, Undone Sinner, Iam All;
Art thou willing that I should be thy All ?
But, as a proof

of that Contempt which this Unbelief has cast upon these

proffers, I would seriously ask of the so many Hundreds

above a Thousand People within these Walls ; which of you

all,
how few of you, can indeed say, Christ is mine, and

I am his, and he is the Beloved of my Soul ?
I would only

say thus much
:
When the precious and glorious Jesus, is

Entreating of us *o Receive Him, in all His Offices, with

all His Benefits ;
the Devil minds what Respect we pay

unto that Heavenly Lord ;
if we Refuse Him that speaks

from Heaven, then he that, Comes from Hell, does with a

sort of claim set in, and cry out, Lord, since this wretch is

not willing that thou shouldst have him, I pray,
let me.

have him.
And thus, by the just vengeance of Heaven,

the Devil becomes a Master, a Prince, a God, unto the

miserable Unbelievers:
but
what are many of them then

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
99

hurried unto
!
All of these Evil Things, do I now set before

you, as Branded with the Mark of the Devil upon them.

V. With Great Regard, with Great Pity, should we Lay

to Heart the Condition of those, who are cast into Affliction,

by the Great Wrath of the Devil.
There is a Number of

our good Neighbours, and some of them very particularly
noted
for Goodness and
Vertue,
of whom we may
say,

Lord, They are vexed with Devils.
Their Tortures being

primarily Inflicted on their Spirits, may indeed cause the

Impressions thereof upon their Bodies to be the less Du-

rable, tho' rather the more Sensible:
but they Endure

Horrible Things, and many have been actually Murdered.
Hard Censures now bestow'd upon these poor
Sufferers,

cannot but be very Displeasing unto our Lord, who, as He

said, about some that had been Butchered by a Pilate, in

Luc.
13.
2,
3. Think ye
that
these were Sinners above

others, because they suffered such Things ? I tell you No,
But except ye Repent, ye shall all likewise Perish:
Even

so, he now says, Think ye that they who now suffer by tlie

Devil, have been greater Sinners than their Neighbours ?

No, Do you Repent of your own Sins Lest the Devil come

to fall foul of you, as he has done to them.
And if this be

so, How Rash a thing would
it be,
if such of the poor

Sufferers, as carry it with a Becoming Piety,
Seriousness,

and Humiliation under their present Suffering, should be

unjustly Censured; or have their very Calamity imputed
unto them as a Crime ?
It is an easie thing, for us to fall

into the Fault of, Adding Affliction to the Afflicted, and of,

Talking to the Grief of those that are already wounded.
Nor can it be wisdom to slight the Dangers of such a Fault.

100
THE WONDERS OF

In the mean time, We have no Bowels in us, if we do not

Compassionate the Distressed County of Essex, now crying

to all these Colonies, Have pity on me,
ye my Friends,

Have pity on me, for the Hand of the Lord has Touched

me, and the Wrath of the Devil has been therewithal turned

upon me.
But indeed, if an hearty pity be due to any, I

am
sure,
the
Difficulties which attend
our Honourable

Judges, do demand no Inconsiderable share in that Pity.
What a Difficult, what an Arduous Task, have those Worthy

Personages now upon their Hands 1
To carry the Knife so

exactly, that on the one
side,
there may be no Innocent

Blood Shed, by too unseeing a Zeal for the Children of

Israel; and that on the other side, there may be no Shelter

given to those Diabolical Works of Darkness, without the
Eemoval whereof we never shall have Peace ;
or to those

Furies whereof
several have kill'd more people perhaps

than would serve to make a Village

: Hie Labor, Hoc Opus

est !
what need have we, to be concerned, that the Sins

of our Israel, may not provoke the God of Heaven to leave

his Davids, unto a wrong Step, in a matter of such Conse-

quence, as
is now before them
!
Our Disingenuous, Un-

charitable, Unchristian Reproaching of such Faithful Men,

after
all,
The Prayers and Supplications,
with strong

Crying and Tears, with which we
are
daily plying the

Throne of Grace, that they may be kept, from what They

Fear,
is none of the way for our preventing of what We

Fear.
Nor all this while, ought our Pity to forget such

Accused ones, as
call for indeed our most Compassionate

Pity, till there be fuller Evidences that they are less worthy

of it.
If Satan have any where maliciously brought upon

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
101

the Stage, those that have hitherto had a just and good

stock of Reputation, for their just and good Living, among

us ;
If the Evil One have obtained a permission to Appear,

in the Figure of such as we have cause
to
think, have

hitherto Abstained, even from the Appearance of Evil
:

It is in Truth, such an Invasion upon Mankind, as may

well Raise an Horror in us all
:
But,
what Compassions

are due to such as may come under such Misrepresentations,

of the Great Accuser!
Who of us can say, what may be

shewn in the Glasses of the Great Lying Spirit ?
Altho'

the Usual Providence of God [we praise Him
! ] keeps us

from such a Mishap; yet where have we an Absolute Pro-

mise, that we shall every one always be kept from it?
As

long as Charity is bound to Think no Evil, it will not Hurt

us that are Private Persons, to forbear the Judgmentwhich

belongs not unto us.
Let it rather be our Wish, May the

Lord help them to Learn the Lessons,
for which they are

now put unto so hard a School.

VI. With a Great Zeal, we
should lay hold on
the

Covenant of God, that we may secure Us and Ours, from

the Great Wrath, with which the Devil Rages.
Let us

come into the Covenant of Grace, and then we shall not be

hook'd into a Covenant with the Devil, nor be altogether

unfurnished with Armour, against the Witches that are

in
that
Covenant.
The way to come under the Saving

Influences of the New Covenant, is, to close with the Lord

Jesus Christ, who is the All-sufficient Mediator of it: Let

us therefore do, that, by Resigning up our selves unto the

Saving, Teaching, and Ruling Hands of this Blessed Me-

diator.
Then we shall be, what we read in Jude 1. Pre-

102
THE WONDERS OF

served in Christ Jesus: That
is, as the Destroying Angel,

could not meddle with such as had been distinguished, by
the Blood of the Passeover on their Houses
: Thus the Blood

of the Lord Jesus
Christ, Sprinkled on our
Souls, will

Preserve us from the Devil.
The Birds of prey (and in-

deed the Devils most literally in the shape of great Birds!)
are flying about.
Would we find a Covert from these Vul-

tures?
Let us then Hear our Lord Jesus from Heaven

Clocquing unto us,
that you ivould be gathered under my

wings ! Well ;
When this
is done, Then let us own the

Covenant, which we are now come
into, by joining our

selves to a particular Church, walking in the Order of the

Gospel ;
at the doing whereof, according to that Covenant

of God, We give up Our selves unto the Lord, and in Him

unto One Another.
While others have had their Names

Entred in the Devils Book ; let our Names be found in the
Church Book, and let us be Written among the Living in

Jerusalem.
By no means let, Church Work sink and fail

in the midst of us ; but let the Tragical Accidents which
now happen, exceedingly Quicken that work.
So many of

the Rising Generation, utterly forgetting the Errand of

our Fathers to build Churches in this Wilderness, and so

many of our Cottages being allow'd
to Live, where they

do not, and perhaps cannot, wait upon God with the Churches

of His People ;
'tis as likely as any one thing to procure

the swarmings of Witch crafts among us.
But it becomes

us, with a like Ardour,
to bring our poor Children with

us, as we shall do, when we come our selves, into the Cove-
nant of God.
It would break an heart of Stone, to have

seen, what I have
lately
seen
; Even
poor
Children
of

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
103

several
Ages, even from
seven to twenty, more
or less,

Confessing their Familiarity with Devils; but at the same

time,
in Doleful
bitter Lamentations, that made a
little

Pourtraiture of HM
it self, Expostulating with their ex-

ecrable Parents, for Devoting them to the Devil
in their

Infancy, and so Entailing of Devillism upon them
!
Now,

as
the Psalmist could
say, My Zeal hath consumed me,

because my Enemies have forgotten thy words : Even so,

let the Nefarious wickedness of those that have Explicitly

dedicated their Children to the Devil, even with Devilish

Symbols, of such a Dedication, Provoke our Zeal to have

our Children, Sincerely, Signally, and openly Consecrated

unto God; with an Education afterwards
assuring and

confirming that Consecration.

VII. Let our Prayer go up with great Faith, against

the Devil, that comes down in great Wrath.
Such is the

Antipathy of the Devil to our Prayer, that he cannot bear

to stay long where much of it
is:
Indeed it is Diaboli

Flagellum, as well as, Miseries Remedium; the Devil will

soon
be
Scourg'd out of the Lord's Temple, by a Whip,

made and used, with the effectual fervent Prayer of Righ-

teous Men.
When the Devil by Afflicting of us, drives us

to our Prayers, he
is The Fool making a Whip for his

own Back.
Our Lord said of the Devil in Matt. 17. 21.

This Kind goes not out, but by Prayer and Fasting*
But,

Prayer and Fasting will soon make the Devil be gone.
Here are Charms indeed!
Sacred and Blessed Charms,

which the Devil cannot stand before.
A Promise of God,

being well managed in the Hands of them that are much

upon
their Knees,
will so resist the Devil, that he will

104
THE WONDERS OF

Flee from us.
At every other Weapon the Devils will be

too hard
for
us
;
the
Spiritual
Wickednesses in High

Places, have manifestly the Upper hand of us
;
that Old

Serpent will be too old for us, too cunning, too subtil
; they

will soon out wit us,
if we think to Encounter them with

any Wit of our own.
But when we come to Prayers, In-

cessant and Vehement Prayers before the Lord, there we

shall be too hard for them.
When well-directed Prayers,

that great Artillery of Heaven, are brought into the Field,
There methinks I see, There are these workers of Iniquity

fallen, all of them ! And who can tell, how much the most

Obscure Christian among you
all, may do towards the

Deliverance of our Land from the Molestations which the

Devil is now giving to us.
I have Read, That on a day of

Prayer kept by some good People for and with a Possessed

Person, the Devil
at
last
flew out
of the Window, and

referring
to a Devout,
plain, mean Woman then
in the

Room, he cry'd out,
the Woman behind the Door!
'Tis

that Woman that forces me away!
Thus the devil that

now troubles
us, may be forced within a while to forsake

us
; and
it
shall be
said, He was driven away by
the

Prayers of some Obscure and Retired Souls, which the

World has taken but
little notice of! The Great God is

about a Great Work at this day among us
: Now, there is

extream Hazard, lest the Devil by Compulsion must submit

to that Great Work, may
also by Permission, come
to

Confound that Work; both in the Detections of some, and

in the Confessions of others, whose Ungodly deeds may be

brought
forth, by a Great Work of God
;
there
is great

Hazard
lest the Devil intertwist some of
his Delusions.

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
105

'Tis PRAYER, I say,
'tis PRAYER, that must carry us well

through the strange things that are now upon us.
Only

that Prayer must then be the Prayer of Faith
:
where

is our Faith in him, Who hath spoiled these Principalities
and Powers, on his Cross, Triumphing over them!

VIII.
Lastly, Shake
off, every Soul, shake off the hard

Took of the Devil.
Where
'tis
said, The whole World

lyes in Wickedness ;
'tis by some of the Ancients rendred,

The ivhole World lyes in the Devil.
The Devil is a Prince,

yea, the Devil
is a God unto
all the Unregeuerate
; and

alas, there is A whole World of them.
Desolate Sinners,

consider what an horrid Lord it is that you are Enslav'd

unto
; and Oh shake off your Slavery to such a Lord.
In-

stead of him, now make your Choice of the Eternal God

in Jesus Christ
; Chuse him with a most unalterable Re-

solution, and unto him say, with Thomas, My Lord, and
my God!
Say with the Church, Lord, other Lords have

had the Dominion over us, but now thou alone shalt be our
Lord for ever.
Then instead of your Perishing under the

wrath of the Devils, God will fetch you to a place among

those that
fill up the Room of the Devils, left by their Fall

from the Ethereal Regions.
It was
a* most awful Speech

made
by
the
Devil,
Possessing a young Woman,
at a

Village in Germany, By the command of God, I am come

to Torment the Body of this young Woman, tho I cannot

hurt her Soul ; and it is that I may warn Men, to take

heed of sinning against God.
Indeed (said he)
'tis very

sore against my will that I do it ;
but
the command of

God forces me to declare wJiat I do ; however I know that

at the Last Day, I shall have more Souls than Godhimself.

106
THE WONDERS OF

So spoke that horrible
Devil!
But
that none of our

Souls may be found among the Prizes of the Devil, in the

Day of God
!
that what the Devil has been forced to

declare,
of his Kingdom among
us, may prejudice
our

Hearts against him for ever!

My Text says, The Devil is come down in great Wrath,

for he has but a short time.
Yea, but if you do not by a

speedy and through conversion to God, escape the Wrath

of the Devil, you will your selves go down, where the Devil

is to be, and you will there be sweltring under the Devils

Wrath, not for a short Time, but, World without end ; not

for a Short Time, but for Infinite Millions of Ages.
The

smoak of your Torment under that Wrath, will Ascend for

ever and ever !
Indeed, the
Devil's time for his Wrath

upon you in this World, can be but short, but his time for

you to do his Work,
or, which
is
all
one, to delay your

turning to God, that
is a Long Time.
When the Devil

was going to be Dispossessed of a Man, he Roar'd out, Am
I to be Tormented before my time ?
You will Torment

the Devil,
if you Rescue your Souls out of his hands, by

true Repentance

:
If once you begin to look that way, he'll

Cry out,
this is before my Time, I must have more Time

yet in the Service of such a guilty Soul.
But, I beseech

you,
let us join
thus
to torment the Devil, in an
holy

Revenge upon him, for all the Injuries which he has done

unto us;
let us
tell him, Satan, thy time with me is but

short, Nay, thy time with me shall
be no more ; I am

unutterably sorry that it has been so much ; Depart from
me thou Evil-Doer, that thou would'st have me to be an Evil

Doer like thy self; I will now for ever keep the Command-

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
107

ments of that God, in whom I Live and Move, and have
my Being !
The Devil has plaid a fine Game for himself

indeed, if by his troubling of our Land, the Souls of many

People should come to think upon their ways, till even they
turn their Feet into
the Testimonies of tJie Lord.
Now

that the Devil may be thus outshot in his own Bow,
is the

desire of all that love the Salvation of God among us, as

well as of. him, who has thus Addressed you.
Amen.

HAVING

thus discoursed on the Wonders of the In-

visible World, I shall now, with God's help, go on to

relate
some
Remarkable
and
Memorable
Instances
of

Wonders which that World has given to ourselves.
And

altho the chief Entertainment which my Readers do expect,
and
shall
receive,
will be a
true History
of what
has

occurred, respecting the WITCHCRAFTS wherewith we are

at this day Persecuted ; yet I shall choose to usher in the

mention of those things, with

A NARRATIVE
OF AN APPARITION WHICH

A GENTLEMAN IN BOSTON, HAD OF HIS BROTHER,

JUST THEN MURTHERED IN LONDON.

IT

was on the Second of May in the Year 1687, that a

most ingenious, accomplished and well-disposed Gen-

tleman, Mr. Joseph Beacon, by Name, about Five a Clock

in the Morning, as he
lay, whether Sleeping or Waking

he could not say, (but judged the latter of them) had a

108
THE WONDERS OF

View of his Brother then at London, altho he was now

himself at Our Boston, distanced from him
a thousand

Leagues.
This
his
Brother appear'd unto him,
in the

Morning about Five a Clock at Boston, having on him a

Bengal Gown, which he usually wore, with a Napkin tyed
about his Head
;
his Countenance was very Pale, Gastly,

Deadly, and he had a bloody wound on one
side of his

Fore-head. Brother! says the Affrighted Joseph. Brother!
Answered the Apparition.
Said Joseph, What's the matter,

Brother?
How came you here !
The Apparition replied,

Brother, I have been most barbarously and injuriously

Butchered, by a Debauched Drunken Fellow, to whom I

never did any torong in my Life.
Whereupon he gave a

particular Description of the Murderer
:
adding, Brother,

This Fellow changing his Name, is attempting to come over

unto New-England, in Foy, or Wild
;
/ would pray you

on the first Arrival of either of these, to get an Order from

the Governor,
to Seize the Person, whom I have now de-

scribed ; and then do you Indict him for the Murder of
me your Brother:
I'll stand by you andprove the Indict-

ment.
And so he Vanished.
Mr. Beacon was extreamly

astonished at what he had seen and hear'd
; and the People

of the Family not only observed an extraordinary Alteration

upon him, for the Week following, but have also given me

under their Hands a
full Testimony,
that he then
gave

them an Account of this Apparition.

All this while, Mr. Beacon had no advice of any thing

amiss attending his Brother then \i\England; but about the

latter end of June following, he understood by the common

ways of Communication, that the April before, his Brother

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
109

going in
haste by Night to
call a Coach
for a Lady, met

a Fellow then in Drink, with his Doxy in his hand
: Some

way or other the Fellow thought himself Affronted with

the hasty passage of this Beacon, and immediately ran into

the Fire-side
of a Neighbouring Tavern, from whence he

fetch'd out a Fire-fork, wherewith he grievously wounded

Beacon in the Skull;
even in that very
part where
the

Apparition show'd
his Wound.
Of this Wound he Lan-

guished
until he Dyed on the Second of May, about
five

of the Clock in the Morning at London.
The Murderer

it seems was endeavouring to Escape,
as the Apparition

affirm'd, but the Friends of the Deceased Beacon, Seized

him; and Prosecuting him
at Law, he found the help of

such Friends as brought him
off without the
loss of his

Life ;
since which, there has no more been heard of the

Business.

This History I received of Mr. Joseph Beacon himself;

who a little before his own Pious and hopeful Death, which

followed not long
after, gave me
the Story written and

signed with his own Hand, and attested with the Circum-

stances I have already mentioned.

BUT

I
shall no longer
detain my
Reader, from
his

expected Entertainment, in
a
brief account
of the

Tryals which have passed upon some of the Malefactors

lately Executed at Salem, for the Witchcrafts whereof they

stood Convicted.
For my own part, I was not present at

any of them ; nor ever had I any Personal prejudice at the

Persons thus brought upon the Stage
; much
less at the

Surviving Relations of those Persons, with and for whom

110
THE WONDERS OF

I would be as hearty a Mourner as any Man living in the

World: The Lord Comfort them!
But having received a

Command so to do, I can do no other than shortly
relate

the chief Matters of Fact, which occurr'd in the Tryals of

some that were Executed, in an Abridgment Collected out

of the Court-Papers on this occasion put into my hands.
You are to take the Truth, just as it was; and the Truth

will hurt no good Man.
There might have been more of

these, if my Book would not thereby have swollen too big ;
and
if some
other worthy hands did not perhaps intend

something further in these Collections ;
for which
cause

I have only singled out Four or Five, which may serve to

illustrate the way of Dealing, wherein Witchcrafts use to

be concerned
; and I report matters not as an Advocate,

but as an Historian.

They were some of the Gracious Words inserted in the

Advice, which many of the Neighbouring Ministers, did

this Summer humbly
lay
before our Honorable Judges,

We cannot
but
ivith
all
thankfulness, acknowledge
the

success which the Merciful God has- given unto the Sedulous
and Assiduous endeavours of Our Honourable Rulers, to

detect the abominable
Witchcrafts which have been com-

mitted in the Country ; Humbly Praying, that the discovery

of those mysterious and mischievous wickednesses, may be

Perfected.
If in the midst of the many Dissatisfactions

among
us,
the Publication of these Tryals, may promote

such a Pious Thankfulness unto God, for Justice being so

far executed among us, I shall Rejoice that God is Glori-

fied, and pray, that no wrong steps of ours may ever sully

any of his Glorious Works.
But we will begin with,

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
Ill

A MODERN INSTANCE OF WITCHES,

DISCOVERED AND CONDEMNED IN A TRYAL,

BEFORE THAT CELEBRATED JUDGE,

SIR MATTHEW HALE.

IT

may cast some Light upon
the Dark things now in

America, if we just give a glance upon the like things

lately happening in Europe. We may see the Witchcrafts
here most exactly resemble the Witchcrafts there ; and we

may learn what sort of Devils do trouble the World.

The Venerable Baxter very truly says, Judge Hale ivas

a Person,
t/ian whom, no Man was more Backward to

Condemn a Witch, without full Evidence.

Now, one of the latest Printed Accounts about a Tryal

of WiteJies, is of what was before him, and it ran on this

wise.
[Printed
in the Year 1682.]
And
it
is here the

rather mentioned, because it was a Tryal, much considered

by the Judges of New-England.

I. Rose Cullender and Amy Duny, were severally In-

dicted, for Bewitching Elizabeth Durent, Ann Durent, Jane

Bocking, Susan Chandler, William Durent, Elizabeth and

Deborah
Pacy.
And the Evidence Avhereou they were

Convicted, stood upon divers particular Circumstances.

//. Ann Durent, Susan Chandler, and Elizabeth Pacy,

when they came into the Hall, to give Instructions for the

drawing the Bills of Indictments, they fell into strange and

violent
Fits,
so
that
they were
unable
to give
in their

112
THE WONDERS OF

Depositions,
not
only
then,
but
also
during the whole

Assizes.
William Durent being an Infant, his Mother

Swore, That Amy Duny looking after her Child one Day

in her absence, did at her return confess, that she had given
suck
to
the
Child:
(tho'
she
were an
Old Woman :)

Whereat, when Durent expressed her displeasure, Duny
went away with Discontents and Menaces.

The Night after, the Child fell into strange and sad Fits,

wherein
it
continued
for
Divers Weeks.
One Doctor

Jacob advised her to hang up the Childs Blanket,
in the

Chimney Corner all Day, and at Night, when she went to

put the Child into
it, if she found any Thing in it then to

throw it without fear into the Fire.
Accordingly, at Night,

there fell a great Toad out of the Blanket, which ran up
and down the Hearth.
A Boy catch't it, and held it in the

Fire with the Tongs
: where
it made an horrible Noise,

and Flash'd like to Gun-Powder, with a report like that of

a Pistol
: Whereupon the Toad was no more to be
seen.

The next Day a Kinswoman of Duny's told the Deponent,

that her Aunt was
all grievously scorch'd with the
Fire,

and the Deponent going to her House, found her in such

a Condition.
Duny told her, she might thank her for it ;

but she should live to see some of her Children Dead, and

her self upon Crutches.
But after the Burning of the Toad,

this Child Recovered.

This Deponent
further
Testifi'd, That Her Daughter

Elizabeth, being about the Age of Ten Years, was taken

in
like manner,
as her first Child was, and
in her
Fits

complained much of Amy Duny, and
said, that she
did

appear to Her, and afflict her in such manner as the former.

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
113

One Day she found Amy Duny in her House, and thrust-

ing her out of Doors, Duny said, You need not be so Angry,

your Child won't live long.
And within three Days the

Child Died.
The Deponent added, that she was Her self,

not long after taken with such a Lameness,
in both her

Legs, that she was forced to go upon Crutches; and she

was now in Court upon them.
[It was Remarkable, that

immediately upon the Juries bringing
in Duny Guilty,

Durent was restored unto the use of her Limbs, and went
home without her Crutches.]

///. As
for Elizabeth and Deborah Pacy, one Aged

Eleven Years, the other Nine;
the elder, being in Court,

was made utterly senseless, during all the time of the Trial
:

or at least speechless.
By the direction of the Judg, Duny

was privately brought to Elizabeth Pacy, and she touched

her Hand:
whereupon the
Child, without
so much
as

seeing her, suddenly leap'd up and flew upon the Prisoner;

the younger was too
ill, to be brought unto the Assizes.

But Samuel Pacy, their Father, testified, that his Daughter
Deborah was taken with a sudden Lameness; and upon

the grumbling of Amy Duny, for being denied something,
where this Child was then sitting, the Child was taken with

an extream pain in her stomach, like the pricking of Pins ;
and shrieking at a dreadful manner, like a Whelp, rather

than a Rational Creature.
The Physicians could not con-

jecture the cause of the Distemper ; but Amy Duny being

a Woman of
ill Fame, and the Child in Fits crying out

of Amy Duny, as affrighting her with the Apparition of

her Person, the Deponent suspected her, and procured her

to be set in the stocks.
While she was there, she said in

I

114
THE WONDERS OF

the
hearing of Two Witnesses, Mr. Pacy
keeps a great

stir about his Child, but let him stay till he has done as
much by
his Children, as I have done by mine : And

being Asked, What
she had done
to her
Children, she

Answered, She had been fain to open her Childs Mouth

with a Tap to give it Victuals.
The Deponent added, that

within Two Days, the
Fits
of his Daughters were
such,

that they could not preserve either Life or Breath, without

the help of a Tap.
And that the Children Cry'd out of

Amy Duny, and of Rose Cullender, as afflicting them with

their Apparitions.

IV. The
Fits of the
Children were
various.
They

would
sometimes be Lame on one
side; sometimes on

t'other.
Sometimes very
sore;
sometimes restored unto

their Limbs, and then Deaf, or Blind, or Dumb, for a long

while together.
Upon the Eecovery of their Speech, they

would Cough extreamly ; and with much Flegm, they would

bring up Crooked Pins; and one time, a Two-penny Nail,
with a very broad Head.
Commonly at the end of every

Fit, they would cast up a Pin.
When the Children Read,

they could not pronounce the name of Lord, or Jesus, or

Christ, but would fall into Fits; and say, Amy Duny says,
I must not use that Name. When they came to the Name

of Satan, or Devil, they would clap their Fingers on the

Book, crying out, This bites, but it makes me speak right

well ! The Children
in
their
Fits would
often Cry
out,

There stands Amy Duny, or Rose
Cullender ; and they

would
afterwards
relate, That
these Witches appearing

before them, threatned them, that if they
told what they

saw or heard, they would Torment them
ten times more

than ever they did before.

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
115

F.
Margaret Arnold, the sister of Mr. Pacy, Testifi'd

unto the
like Sufferings being upon
the Children, at her

House, whither her Brother had Removed them.
And

that sometimes, the Children (only) would see things like

Mice, run about the House; and one
of them suddenly

snap'd one with the Tongs, and threw it into the
Fire,

where
it
screeched out
like a Eat.
At another
time, a

thing
like a Bee, flew at the Face of the younger Child;

the Child fell into a Fit
; and at last Vomited up a Two-

penny Nail, with a Broad Head ;
affirming, That the Bee

brought this Nail, and forced
it into her Mouth.
The

Child would in like manner be assaulted with Flies, which

brought Crooked Pins unto her, and made her first swallow

them, and then Vomit them.
She one Day caught an In-

visible Mouse, and throwing it into the Fire, it Flash'd like

to Gun-Powder.
None besides the Child saw the Mouse,

but every one saw the Flash.
She also declared, out of

her Fits, that in them, Amy Duny much tempted her to

destroy her self.

VI. As
for Ann
Durent, her
Father
Testified, That

upon a Discontent of Rose Cullender, his Daughter was

taken with much Illness in her Stomach and great and sore

Pains, like the Pricking of Pins
: and then Swooning Fits,

from which
Recovering,
she
declared, She had seen
the

Apparition of Rose Cullender, Threatning to Torment her.

She
likewise Vomited up
diverse Pins.
The Maid was

Present at Court, but when Cullender look'd upon her, she

fell into such Fits, as made her utterly unable to declare

any thing.

Ann Baldivin deposed the same.

116
THE WONDERS OF

VII. Jane flocking, was too weak to be at the Assizes.

But her Mother Testifi'd, that her Daughter having for-

merly been Afflicted with Swooning Fits, and Recovered

of them; was now taken with a great Pain in her Stomach;
and New Swooning Fits.
That she took
little Food, but

every Day Vomited Crooked Pins.
In her first Fits, she

would Extend her Arms, and use Postures, as if she catched

at something, and when her Clutched Hands were forced

open, they would find several Pins diversely Crooked, un-

accountably lodged
there.
She would
also mantain a

Discourse with some that were
Invisibly
present, when

casting abroad her Arms, she would often say, / ivill not

Jiave it ! but at last say, Then I ivill have it! and closing her

Hand, which when they presently after opened, a Lath-Nail

was found in
it.
But her great Complaints were of being

Visited by the shapes tfAmyDuny, and Rose Cullender.

VIII. As for Susan Chandler, her Mother
Testified,

That being at the search of Rose Cullender, they found on

her Belly a thing like a Teat, of an inch long;
which the

said Rose ascribed to a strain.
But near her Privy-parts,

they found Three more, that were smaller than the former.
At the end of the long Teat, there was a little Hole, which

appeared,
as
if newly Sucked; and upon
straining
it, a

white Milky matter issued out.
The Deponent further said,

That her Daughter being one Day concerned at Rose Cul-

lenders taking her by the Hand, she fell very sick, and at

Night cry'd out, That Rose Cullender ivould come to Bed

unto her.
Her Fits grew violent, and in the Intervals of

them, she declared, That she saw Rose Cullender in them,
and
once having of a
great Dog with
her.
She also

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
117

Vomited up Crooked Pins
; and when she was brought into

Court, she fell into her Fits.
She Recovered her self in

some Time, and was asked by the Court, whether she was

in a Condition to take an Oath, and give Evidence.
She

said, she could;
but having been Sworn, she fell into her

Fits again, and, Burn her! Burn her! were all the words

that she could obtain power to speak.
Her Father like-

wise gave the same Testimony with her Mother;
as to all

but the Search.

IX. Here was the Sum of the Evidence
:
Which Mr.

Serjeant
Keeling, thought not
sufficient
to
Convict the

Prisoners.
For admitting the Children were Bewitched,

yet, said he,
it can never be Apply'd unto the Prisoners,

upon the Imagination only of the Parties Afflicted ;
inas-

much as no person whatsoever could then be in Safety.

Dr. Brown, a very Learned Person then present, gave

his
Opinion,
that
these Persons
were
Bewitched.
He

added, That in Denmark, there had been lately a great Dis-

covery of Witches ; who used the very same way of Afflicting

people, by Conveying Pins and
Nails
into them.
His

Opinion was, that the Devil in Witchcrafts, did Work upon

the Bodies of Men and Women, upon a Natural Founda-

tion ; and that he did Extraordinarily
afflict them, with

such Distempers as their Bodies were most subject unto.

X. The Experiment about the Usefulness, yea, or Law-

fulness whereof Good Men have sometimes disputed, was

divers Times made, That
tho' the Afflicted were utterly

deprived of all sense in their Fits, yet upon the Touch of

the Accused, they would so screech out, and fly up, as not

upon any other persons.
And yet it was also found that

118
THE WONDERS OF

once upon the touch of an innocent person, the like
effect

follow'd which put
the whole Court unto a stand
:
altho'

a small Reason was at length attempted to be given for it.

XI. However, to strengthen the Credit of what had been

already produced against the Prisoners, One John Soam

Testified, That bringing home his Hay in Three Carts, one

of the Carts wrenched the Window of Rose Cullenders

House, whereupon she flew out, with violent Threatenings

against the Deponent.
The other Two
Carts, passed by

Twice, Loaded, that Day afterwards; but the Cart which

touched Cullenders House, was Twice or Thrice that Day

overturned.
Having again Loaded
it, as they brought it

thro' the Gate which Leads out of the
Field, the
Cart

stuck so fast in the Gates Head, that they could not possibly

get it thro', but were
forced to cut down the Post of the

Gate, to make the Cart pass
thro', altho' they could not

perceive
that the Cart did of either side touch the Gate-

Post.
They
afterwards, did with much Difficulty get it

home to the Yard; but
could not
for their lives get the

Cart near the place, where they should unload.
They were

fain to unload at a great Distance ; and when
they were

Tired, the Noses of them that came to Assist them, would

burst forth a Bleeding;
so they were fain to give over till

next morning; and then they unloaded without any
diffi-

culty.

XIL
Robert Sherringham also Testifi'd, That the Axle-

Tree of his Cart, happening in passing, to break some part

of Rose Cullenders House, in her Anger at
it, she vehe-

mently threatned him, His Horses should su/er for
it.

And within a short time,
all his Four Horses dy'd;
after

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
119

which he sustained many other Losses in the sudden Dying

of his Cattle.
He was
also taken with a Lameness in his

Limbs; and so vexed with Lice of an extraordinary Num-

ber and Bigness, that no Art could hinder the Swarming

of them,
till he burnt up two Suits of Apparel.

XIII. As forAmy Duny, 'twas TestifTd by one Richard

Spencer that he heard her say, The Devil would not let her

Rest ;
until she were Revenged on the Wife of Cornelius

Sandswel.
And that Sandswel testified, that her Poultry

dy'd suddenly, upon Amy Dunys threatning of them ;
and

that her Husbands Chimney
fell, quickly after Duny had

spoken of such a disaster.
And a Firkin of Fish could not

be kept from falling into the water, upon suspicious words

of Duny's.

XIV. The Judg told the Jury, they were
to
inquire

now,
first, whether these Children were Bewitched; and

secondly, Whether the Prisoners at the Bar were guilty of

it.
He made no doubt,
there were
such
Creatures as

AVitches ; for the Scriptures affirmed it
; and the Wisdom

of all Nations had provided Laws
against such persons.

He pray'd the God of Heaven to direct their Hearts in the

weighty thing they had in hand
;
for, To Condemn
the

Innocent, and let the guilty go free, were both an Abomi-

nation to the Lord.

The Jury in half an hour brought them in Guilty upon

their several Indictments, which were Nineteen in Number.

The next Morning,
the
Children with
their
Parents,

came to the Lodgings of the Lord Chief Justice, and were

in as good health as ever
in their Lives; being Restored

within half an Hour after the Witches were Convicted.

120
THE WONDERS OF

The Witches were Executed
;
and Confessed nothing
;

which indeed will not be wondred by them, who Consider

and Entertain the Judgment of a Judicious Writer, That

the Unpardonable Sin, is most usually Committed by Pro-

fessors of the Christian Religion, falling into Witchcraft,

We will now proceed unto
several of the
like Tryals

among our selves.

I.
/ J

THE TRYAL OF G. B; AT A COURT OF

OYER AND "TERMINER,

HELD IN SALEM, 1692.

GLAD

should I have been, if I had never known the

Name of this Man
:
or never had this occasion to

mention so much as the
first Letters of his Name.
But

the Government requiring some Account of his Trial to be

inserted in this Book, it becomes me with all Obedience to

submit unto the Order.

I.
This G. B. Was Indicted for Witch-craft, and in the

prosecution of the Charge against him, he was Accused by

five or six of the Bewitched, as the Author of their Mise-

ries ; he was Accused by Eight of the Confessing Witches,

as being an head Actor at some
of their
Hellish Ran-

dezvouzes, and one who had the promise of being a King

in
Satan's Kingdom, now going to be Erected
: He was

accused by Nine Persons
for extraordinary Lifting, and

such
feats
of Strength
as could not be done without a

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
121

Diabolical Assistance.
And for other such things he was

Accused, until about thirty Testimonies were
brought in

against him; nor were these judg'd the half of what might
have been considered
for
his Conviction
:
However they

were enough to
fix
the
Character of a Witch upon him

according
to
the Rules
of Reasoning,
by the Judicious

Gaule, in that Case directed.

II. The Court being sensible, that the Testimonies of

the Parties
Bewitched, use to have a Room among
the

Suspicions or Presumptions, brought in against one
In-

dicted for Witch-craft;
there were now heard the Testi-

monies
of
several
Persons, who were most
notoriously

Bewitched, and every day Tortured by
Invisible Hands,

and these now all charged the Spectres of G. B. to have

a share
in their Torments.
At the Examination
of this

G. B.
the Bewitched People were
grievously harrassed

with Preternatural Mischiefs, which could not possibly be

Dissembled; and they still ascribed it unto the endeavours

of G. B. to Kill them.
And now upon the Tryal of one

of the Bewitched Persons, testified, that in her Agonies, a

little black
Hair'd Man came
to
her,
saying
his Name

was B. and bidding her set her hand to a Book which he

shewed unto her ; and bragging that he was a Conjurer,
above the ordinary Rank of Witches ; That he often Per-

secuted her with the offer of that Book, saying, She should

be well, and need fear nobody, if she would but Sign it ;
But he inflicted cruel Pains and Hurts upon her, because

of her denying so to do.
The Testimonies of the other

Sufferers concurred with
these; and
it was remarkable,

that whereas Biting was one of the ways which the Witches

122
THE WONDERS OF

used for the vexing of the Sufferers; when they cry'd out

of G. B. Biting them, the
print of the Teeth would be

seen on the Flesh of the Complainers, and just such a Set

of Teeth as G. B's would then appear upon them, which

could be
distinguished from
those
of some other Mens.

Others of them
testified, That in
their Torments, G. B.

tempted them to go unto a Sacrament, unto which
they

perceived him with a Sound of Trumpet, Summoning of

other Witches, who quickly after the Sound, would come

from
all
Quarters unto
the Kendezvouz.
One of them

falling
into a kind
of Trance, affirmed, that G. B. had

carried
her away
into a very
high Mountain, where he

shewed her mighty and glorious Kingdoms, and said, He

would give them all to her, if she would write in his Book;
But she told him, They were none of his to give; and re-

fused
the Motions;
enduring
of much Misery
for that

refusal.

It cost the Court a wonderful deal of Trouble, to hear

the Testimonies of the Sufferers;
for when they were going

to give in their Depositions, they would for a long time be

taken with Fits, that made them uncapable of saying any

thing.
The Chief Judg asked the Prisoner, who he thought

hindered these Witnesses from giving their Testimonies ?
And he answered, He supposed
it was the Devil.
That

Honourable Person replied, How comes the Devil
then
to

be so loath
to
Jiave any Testimony born
against you?

Which cast him into very great Confusion.

III.
It has been a
frequent thing
for the Bewitched

People
to be entertained with Apparitions
of Ghosts of

Murdered People, at the same time that the Spectres of

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
123

the Witches
trouble
them.
These Ghosts do
always

affright the
Beholders more
than all the
other spectral

Kepresentations; and when they exhibit themselves, they

cry
out, of being Murthered by the Witch-crafts or other

Violences of the Persons who are then in Spectre present.

It is further considered, that once or twice, these Appari-

tions have been seen by others, at the very same time they
have shewn themselves to the Bewitched ; and seldom have

there been these Apparitions, but when something unusual

or suspected, have attended the Death of the Party thus

Appearing.
Some that have been accused by these Appa-

ritions accosting of the Bewitched People, who had never

heard a word of any such Persons ever being in the World,
have upon a fair Examination, freely and
fully confessed

the Murthers of those very Persons, altho' these also did

not know how the Apparitions had complained of them.

Accordingly
several of the Bewitched, had given in their

Testimony, that they had been troubled with the Appari-

tions of two Women, who said, that they were G. JB's two

Wives, and that he had been the Death of them ; and that

the Magistrates must be told of it, before whom if B. upon

his Tryal denied it, they did not know but that they should

appear again in Court.
Now, G. B. had been Infamous for

the Barbarous usage of his two late Wives, all the Country

over.
Moreover,
it was
testified,
the
Spectre
of G. B.

threatning of the Sufferers, told them, he had Killed (be-

sides others) Mrs. Lawson and her Daughter Ann.
And

it was
noted,
that
these
were
the Vertuous Wife and

Daughter of one at whom this G. B. might have a preju-

dice for his being serviceable at Salem Village, from whence

124
THE WONDERS OF

himself had in ill Terms removed some Years before
: And

that when they
dy'd, which was long since, there were

some odd Circumstances about them, which made some of

the Attendents
there
suspect
something of Witch-craft,

tho none Imagined from what Quarter it should come.

Well,
6r. B. being now upon
his Tryal, one of the Be-

witched Persons was cast into Horror at the Ghost of IPs

two Deceased Wives then appearing before him, and crying

for
Vengeance
against him.
Hereupon
several
of
the

Bewitched Persons were successively called in, who all not

knowing what the former had seen and said, concurred in

their Horror of the
Apparition, which they affirmed that

he had
before him.
But he, tho much appalled, utterly

deuy'd that he discerned any thing of it ; nor was it any

part of his Conviction.

IV.
Judicious Writers have assigned it a great place in

the Conviction of Witches, when Persons are Impeached

by
other notorious
Witches, to
be as
ill as
themselves;

especially, ifthe Persons have beenmuch notedfor neglecting

the Worship of God.
Now,
as there might have been

Testimonies enough of G. B

Js Antipathy to Prayer, and

the
other
Ordinances
of God,
tho
by
his
Profession,

singularly
Obliged
thereunto;
so,
there now
came
in

against the Prisoner, the Testimonies of several Persons,
who confessed their own having been horrible Witches, and

ever since their Confessions, had been themselves
terribly

Tortured by the Devils and other Witches, even
like the

other Sufferers ; and therein undergone the Pains of many
Deaths for their Confessions.

These now
testified, that
G.
B. had been
at Witch-

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
125

meetings with them ; and that he was the Person who had

Seduc'd, and CompelPd them
into the
snares of Witch-

craft: That he promised them Fine Cloaths, for doing it;

that he brought Poppets to them, and Thorns to stick into

those Poppets, for the Afflicting of other People ; and that

he exhorted them with the rest of the Crew, to Bewitch

all Salem
Village, but besure to do it Gradually, if they

would prevail in what they did.

When the Lancashire Witches were Condemn'd, I don't

remember that there was any considerable further Evidence,
than
that of the Bewitched, and than
that of some that

confessed.
We see so much already against G. B.
But

this being indeed not enough, there were other things to

render what had been already produced credible.

V. A famous Divine recites this among the Convictions

of a Witch
;
The
Testimony of
the party Bewitched,

whether Pining or Dying ;
together with the joint Oaths

of sufficient Persons
that have seen certain Prodigious

Pranks or Feats wrought by the Party Accused.
Now,

God had been pleased so to leave
this G. B. that he had

ensnared himself by several Instances, which he had
for-

merly given of a Preternatural Strength, and which were
now produced against him.
He was a very Puny Man,

yet he had often done things beyond
the
strength
of a

Giant.
A Gun of about seven foot Ban-el, and so heavy

that strong Men could not steadily hold
it out with both

hands
;
there were several Testimonies, given in by Per-

sons of Credit and Honor, that he made nothing of taking

up such a Gun behind the Lock, with but one hand, and

holdiug
it out
like a Pistol, at Anns-end.
G. B. in his

126
THE WONDERS OF

Vindication, was so foolish as to say, That an Indian was

there, and held it out at the same time : Whereas none of

the Spectators ever saw any such Indian ; but they sup-

posed, the Black Man, (as the Witches call the Devil ; and

they generally
say he resembles an Indian) might give

him that Assistance.
There was Evidence likewise brought

in, that he made nothing of taking up whole Barrels fill'd

with Molasses or Cider, in very disadvantageous Postures,
and Carrying of them through the difficultest Places out of

a Canoo to the Shore.

Yea, there were two Testimonies, that G. B. with only

putting the Fore Finger of his Right Hand into the Muzzle

of an heavy Gun, a Fowling-piece of about
six
or seven

foot Barrel, did lift up the Gun, and hold it out at Arms-

end; a Gun which
the Deponents thought
strong Men

could not with both hands lift up, and hold out at the But-

end, as
is
usual.
Indeed, one
of these
Witnesses was

over-perswaded by some Persons, to be out of the way upon
G. It's Tryal ; but he came afterwards with Sorrow for his

withdraw, and gave in his Testimony
: Nor were either of

these Witnesses made use of as Evidences in the Trial.

VI.
There came in several Testimonies
relating to the

Domestick Affairs of G. B. which had a very hard Aspect

upon him ; and not
only prov'd him a very
ill Man
; but

also confirmed the belief of the Character, which had been

already fastned on him.

'Twas testified, that keeping his two Successive Wives

in a strange kind of Slavery, he would when he came home

from abroad, pretend to tell the Talk which any had with

them; That he has brought them to the point of Death,

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
127

by his harsh Dealings with his Wives, and then made the

People about him, to promise that in
case Death
should

happen, they would say nothing of it; That he used all

means to make his Wives Write, Sign, Seal, and Swear a

Covenant, never to reveal any
of his
Secrets;
That
his

Wives had privately complained unto the Neighbours about

frightful Apparitions of Evil Spirits, with which their House
was sometimes infested; and that many such things have

been whispered among the
Neighbourhood.
There were

also some
other
Testimonies
relating
to
the Death
of

People whereby the Consciences of an Impartial Jury were

convinced that G. B. had Bewitched the Persons mentioned

in the Complaints.
But I am forced to omit several pas-

sages,
in
this, as
well
as
in
all
the
succeeding
Tryals,

because the Scribes who took notice of them, have not sup-

plyed me.

VII.
One
Mr. Ruck,
Brother-in-Law
to
this
G. B.

testified, that G. B. and himself, and his Sister, who was

G. B's Wife, going out
for two or three Miles to gather

Straw-berries, Ruck with
his
Sister,
the Wife
of G. B.

Rode home very Softly, with G. B. on Foot in their Com-

pany, G. B. stept aside a little into the Bushes; where-

upon they halted and Halloo'd for him.
He not answering,

they went away homewards, with a quickened pace, without

expectation of seeing him in a considerable while ; and yet
when they were
got
near home, to their
Astonishment,

they
found him
on foot
with
them, having a Basket of

Straw-berries.
G. B. immediately then
fell
to
Chiding

his Wife, on the account of what she had been speaking to

her Brother, of him,
on
the
Road
: which
when
they

128
THE WONDERS OF

wondred at, he said, He knew their thoughts.
Ruck being

startled at
that,
made some Reply, intimating, that the

Devil himself did not know so far;
but G. B. answered,

My God makes known your
Thoughts unto me.
The

Prisoner now at the Bar had nothing to answer, unto what

was thus witnessed against him, that was worth consider-

ing. Only he said, Ruck, and his Wife
left a Man with

him, when they left him.
Which Ruck now amrm'd to be

false
;
and when the Court asked
G. B. What the Man's

Name was?
his Countenance was much altered/ nor could

he say, who 'twas.
But the Court began to think, that he

then step'd aside, only that by the assistance of the Blark

Man, he might put on his Invisibility, and in that Fasci-

nating Mist,
gratifie
his own
Jealous Humour,
to hear

what they said of him.
Which
trick of rendring them-

selves Invisible,
our Witches do
in their Confessions pre-

tend,
that
they sometimes
are Masters of; and
it is the

more credible, because there
is Demonstration, that they

often render many other things utterly Invisible.

VIII.
Faltring, faulty, unconstant, and contrary An-

swers upon judicial and
deliberate
Examination,
are

counted some unlucky Syrnptons of Guilt,
in all
Crimes,

especially in Witchcrafts.
Now there never was a Prisoner

more eminent for them, than G. B. both at his Examina-

tion and on his Trial.
His Tergiversations, Contradictions,

and Falshoods were very sensible
: he had little to say, but

that he had heard some things that he could not prove, Re-

flecting upon
the
Reputation of some
of the
Witnesses.

Only he gave in a Paper to the Jury
;
wherein, altho' he

had many times
before,
granted, not only that there are

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
129

Witches, but also, that the present Sufferings of the Country

are the effects of horrible Witchcrafts, yet he now goes to

evince
it, That there neither are, nor ever were
Witches,

that having made a Compact with the Devil, can send a

Devil to Torment otherpeople at a distance.
This Paper

was Transcribed out of Ady ; which the Court presently

knew, as soon as they heard it.
But he said, he had taken

none of it out of any Book ;
for which, his Evasion after-

wards, was, That a Gentleman gave him the Discourse in

a Manuscript, from whence he Transcribed
it.

IX. The Jury brought him
in Guilty : But when he

came to Die, he utterly deni'd the Fact, whereof he had

been thus convicted.

II.

THE
TRYAL
OF
BRIDGET
BISHOP,
ALIAS

OLIVER, AT THE COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER,

HELD AT SALEM, JUNE 2. 1692.

I.

SHE

was indicted
for Bewitching
of several Persons

in the Neighbourhood, the Indictment being drawn

up,
according
to
the Form
in
such Cases usual.
And

pleading, Not Guilty, there were brought in several persons,
who had long undergone many kinds of Miseries, which

were preternaturally inflicted, and generally ascribed unto

an horrible Witchcraft.
There was little occasion to prove

the Witchcraft,
it being evident and notorious to all be-

130
THE WONDERS OF

holders.
Now
to
fix the
Witchcraft on the Prisoner at

the
Bar, the first thing used, was the Testimony of the

Bewitched ;
whereof several
testifi'd, That the Shape of

the Prisoner did oftentimes very grievously Pinch them,
Choak them, Bite them, and
Afflict them
;
urging them

to write their Names in a Book, which the said Spectre

called, Ours.
One of them did further testifie, that it was

the Shape of this
Prisoner, with another, which one day

took her from her Wheel, and carrying her to the River-

side, threatned there to Drown her, if she did not Sign to

the Book mentioned
: which yet she refused.
Others of

them did also testifie, that the said Shape did in her Threats

brag to them that she had been the Death of sundry Per-

sons, then by her named ; that
she had Ridden
a Man

then likewise named.
Another testifi'd, the Apparition of

Ghosts unto the Spectre of Bishop, crying out, You Mur-

dered us !
About the Truth whereof, there was
in the

Matter of Fact but too much suspicion.

II.
It was
testifi'd, That
at
the Examination
of the

Prisoner before the Magistrates, the Bewitched were ex-

treamly tortured.
If she did but cast her Eyes on them,

they were presently struck down ; and this in such a manner

as there could be no Collusion in the Business.
But upon

the Touch of her Hand upon them, when they lay in their

Swoons, they would immediately Revive ; and not upon

the Touch of any ones else.
Moreover, Upon some Special

Actions of her Body, as the shaking of her Head, or the

turning of her Eyes, they presently and painfully fell into

the like postures.
And many of the like Accidents now

fell out, while she was at the Bar.
One at the same time

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
131

testifying, That she said, She could not
be troubled to see

the afflicted thus tormented.

III.
There was Testimony likewise brought in, that a

Man striking once at the place, where a bewitched person

said, the Shape of this Bishop stood, the bewitched cried

out, That he had tore her Coat, ill the place then particu-

larly
specified; and the "Woman's Coat was found to be

Torn in that very place.

IV. One Deliverance Hobbs, who had confessed her being

a Witch, was now tormented by the
Spectres,
for
her

Confession.
And
she now
testifi'd,
That
this
Bishop

tempted her to Sign the Book again, and to deny what she

had confessed.
She affirm'd, That it was the Shape of this

Prisoner, which whipped her with Iron Rods, to compel

her thereunto.
And she affirmed, that this Bishop was at

a General Meeting of the Witches, in a Field at Salem-

Village, and
there partook of a Diabolical Sacrament in

Bread and Wine then administred.

V. To render it further unquestionable, that the Prisoner

at the Bar, was the Person truly charged in THIS Witch-

craft,
there were produced many
Evidences
of OTHER

Witchcrafts, by
her
perpetrated.
For
Instance,
John

' Cook testifi'd, That about five or six Years ago, one Morn-

ing, about Sun-Rise, he was in his Chamber assaulted by

the Shape of this Prisoner
: which look'd on him,
grinn'd

at him, and very much hurt him with a Blow on the side

of the Head
: and that on the same day, about Noon, the

same Shape walked in
the Room where he was, and an

Apple strangely flew out of his Hand, into the Lap of his

Mother, six or eight Foot from him.

132
THE WONDERS OF

VI. Samuel Gray testifi'd, That about fourteen Years

ago, he wak'd on a Night, and saw the Room where he

lay full of Light ; and that he then saw plainly a Woman

between the Cradle, and
the Bed-side, which look'd upon

him.
He rose, and it vanished ;
tho' he found the Doors

all fast.
Looking out at the Entry-door, he saw the same

Woman,
in
the same Garb again
;
and
said,
In God's

Name, ivhat do you comefor ?
He went to Bed, and had

the same Woman again assaulting him.
The Child in the

Cradle gave a great Screech, and the Woman disappeared.

It was long before the Child could be quieted ; and tho' it

were a very likely thriving Child, yet from
this time
it

pined away, and, after divers Months, died in a sad Con-

dition.
He knew not Bishop, nor her, Name
; but when

he saw her after
this, he knew by her Countenance, and

Apparel, and all Circumstances, that it was the Apparition

of this Bishop, which had thus troubled him.

VII. John Ely and his Wife testifi'd, That he bought

a Sow of Edward Bishop, the Husband of the Prisoner ;
and was
to pay the
Price agreed,
unto another person.

This Prisoner being angry that she was thus hindred from

fingring the Mony, quarrell'd with Ely.
Soon after which,

the Sow was taken with strange Fits; Jumping, Leaping,
and Knocking her Head against the Fence ;
she seem'd

Blind and
Deaf, and would neither Eat nor be
Suck'd.

Whereupon a Neighbour said, she believed the Creature

was Over-looked;
and sundry other
Circumstances con-

curred, which made the Deponents believe that Bishop had

bewitched
it.

VIII.
Richard Coman
testifi'd, That eight Years ago,

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
133

as he lay awake in his Bed, with a Light burning in the

Room, he was annoy'd with the Apparition of this Bishoj),
and of two more that were strangers to him, who came and

oppressed him so, that he could neither
stir himself, nor

wake any one else, and that he was the night
after, mo-

lested again in the
like manner
;
the said Bishop taking

him by the Throat, and pulling him almost out of the Bed.

His Kinsman offered for this cause to lodge with him
; and

that Night, as they were awake, discoursing together, this
Coman was
once more
visited by the Guests which had

formerly been so troublesom ;
his Kinsman
being at the

same time struck speechless, and unable to move Hand or

Foot.
He had laid his Sword by him, which these unhappy

Spectres did strive much to wrest from him ; only he held

too fast for them.
He then grew able to call the People

of his House
; but altho' they heard him, yet they had not

power to speak or
stir ;
until
at
last, one of the People

crying out,
What's the matter? The Spectres all vanished.

IX. Samuel Shattock testify'd, That in the Year, 1680,

this Bridget Bishop, often came to his House upon such

frivolous and
foolish
Errands,
that
they
suspected
she

came indeed with a purpose of mischief.
Presently, where-

upon, his eldest Child, which was of as promising Health

and Sense, as any Child of
its Age, began
to droop ex-

ceedingly ; and the oftner that Bishop came to the House,

the worse grew the Child.
As the Child would be stand-

ing at the Door, he would be thrown and bruised against

the Stones, by an invisible Hand, and in like
sort knock

his Face against the sides of the House, and bruise it after

a miserable manner.
Afterwards this Ei&hop would bring

134
THE WONDERS OF

him things to Dye, whereof he could not imagin any use ;
and when she paid him a piece of Mony, the Purse and

Mony were unaccountably conveyed out of a lock'd Box,
and never seen any more.
The Child was immediately,

hereupon, taken with
terrible
Fits, whereof his
Friends

thought he would have dyed

: Indeed he did almost nothing

but Cry and Sleep
for several Months together ;
and at

length his Understanding was utterly taken away.
Among

other Symptoms of an Inchantment upon him, one was,
That there was a Board in the Garden, whereon he would

walk
; and
all the Invitations
in
the World could never

fetch him
off.
About 17 or 18 years after, there came a

Stranger to Shattock's House, who seeing the Child, said,
This poor Child is Bewitched; and you have a Neighbour

living not far
off, who
is a Witch.
He added, Your

Neighbour has had afalling out with your Wife ; and she

said, in her Heart, your Wife
is a proud Woman, and

she would bring down her Pride in this Child.
He then

remembred,
that Bishop had parted
from
his
Wife
in

muttering and menacing Terms, a little before the Child
was taken
111.
The abovesaid Stranger would needs carry

the bewitched Boy with
him, to Bishop's House, on pre-

tence of buying a pot of Cyder.
The Woman entertained

him
in
furious
manner;
and
flew
also upon the
Boy,

scratching his Face till the Blood came
; and saying, Thou

Rogue, what dost thou bring this Fellow here to plague
me ?
Now it seems the Man had
said, before he went,

That he would fetch Blood of her.
Ever
after the Boy

was follow'd with grievous Fits, which the Doctors them-

selves generally ascribed unto Witchcraft; and wherein he

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
135

would be thrown still into the Fire or the Water, if he were

not constantly look'd after; and it was verily believed that

Bishop was the cause of it.

X. John Louder testify'd, That upon some little Con-

troversy with Bishop about her Fowls, going well to Bed,
he did awake
in
the
Night by Moonlight, and did
see

clearly the likeness of this Woman grievously oppressing
him ; in which miserable condition she held him, unable to

help himself, till near Day.
He told Bishop of this; but

she deny'd it, and threatned him very much.
Quickly after

this, being at home on a Lords day, with the doors shut

about him, he saw a black Pig approach him
;
at which,

he going to kick,
it vanished away.
Immediately after,

sitting down, he saw a black Thingjump in at the Window,
and come and
stand before
him.
The Body was
like

that of a Monkey, the Feet like a Cocks, but the Face
much like a Mans.
He being so extreamly affrighted, that

he could not speak
;
this Monster spoke to him, and said,

/ am a Messenger sent unto you, for I understand that

you are in some Trouble of Mind, and if you will be ruled

by me, you shall wantfor nothing in this World.
Where-

upon he endeavoured to clap his Hands upon
it;
but he

could feel no substance; and it jumped out of theWindow

again
; but immediately came
in by the
Porch, tho' the

Doors were shut, and said, You had better take my Coun-

sel ! He then struck at it with a Stick, but struck only the

Ground-sel, and broke the
Stick
: The Ann with which

he struck was presently Disenabled, and it vanished away.
He presently went out
at the Back-door, and
spied
this

Bishop, in her Orchard, going toward her House ; but he

136
THE WONDERS OF

had not power to set one foot forward unto her.
Where-

upon,
returning
into
the
House,
he
was
immediately

accosted by the Monster he had seen before ; which Goblin

was now going to fly at him
; whereat he cry'd out, The

whole armour of God be between me and you ! So it sprang

back, and flew over the Apple-tree
; shaking many Apples

off the Tree, in its flying over.
At
its leap,
it flung Dirt

with its Feet against the Stomack of the Man
; whereon

he was then struck Dumb, and so continued for three Days

together.
Upon the producing of this Testimony, Bishop

deny'd
that
she knew
this Deponent

:
Yet
their two

Orchards joined
; and they had often had their little Quar-

rels for some years together.

XI.
William Stacy
testify'd, That receiving Mony of

this Bishop, for work done by him
; he was gone but a

matter of three Rods from her, and looking for his Mony,
found it unaccountably gone from him.
Some time after,

Bishop asked him, whether his Father would grind her

Grist for her ?
He demanded why ?
She reply'd, Because

Folks count me a Witch.
He answered, No question but

he will grind it for you.
Being then gone about six Rods

from her, with a small Load in his Cart, suddenly the Off-

wheel stump'd, and sunk down into an
hole, upon plain

Ground ;
so that the Deponent was forced to get help for

the recovering of the Wheel
: But stepping back to look

for the
hole, which might give him
this
Disaster, there

was none at all to be
found.
Some time
after, he was

waked
in the Night ; but
it seem'd as light as day
; and

he perfectly saw the shape of this Bishop in the Room,

troubling of him ; but upon her going out, all was dark

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
137

again.
He
charg'd Bishop afterwards with
it, and she

deny'd it not
; but was
very angry.
Quickly after, this

Deponent having been threatned by Bishop, as he was in

a dark Night going
to
the Barn, he was very
suddenly

taken
or lifted from
the
Ground, and thrown
against a

Stone-wall
: After that, he was again hoisted up and thrown

down a Bank, at the end of his House.
After this again,

passing by
this Bishop,
his Horse with
a
small
Load,

striving to draw,
all his Gears flew to pieces, and the Cart

fell down
; and this Deponent going then to lift a Bag of

Corn, of about two Bushels, could not budge it with all his

Might.

Many other Pranks of this Bishop's this Deponent was

ready to testify. He also testify'd, That he verily believ'd,

the
said Bishop was
the
Instrument
of
his
Daughter

Priscilla's Death
;
of which suspicion, pregnant Reasons

were assigned.

XII. To crown all, John Bly and William Ely testify'd,

That being employ'd by Bridget Bishop, to help to take
down the Cellar-wall of the old house wherein she formerly

lived, they did in holes of the said old Wall, find several

Poppets, made up of Rags and Hogs-bristles, with head-

less Pins in them, the Points being outward
; whereof she

could give no account unto the Court, that was reasonable

or tolerable.

XIII. One thing that made against the Prisoner was,

her being evidently convicted of yross Lying in the Court,

several times, while she was making her plea
; but besides

this, a Jury of Women found a preternatural Teat upon
her Body
: But upon a second search, within 3 or 4 hours,

138
THE WONDERS OF

there was no
such, thing to be
seen.
There was also an

Account of other People whom this Woman had Afflicted;
and there might have been many more,
if they had been

enquired for
; but there was no need of them.

XIV.
There was one very
strange
thing more, with

which the Court was newly entertained.
As this Woman

was under a Guard,
passing by the great and
spacious

Meeting-house
of Salem,
she gave
a
look towards
the

House
:
And immediately a Dcemon invisibly entring the

Meeting-house, tore down a part of it
;
so that tho' there

was no Person
to be seen
there, yet the People,
at
the

noise, running in, found a Board, which was strongly fastned

with several Nails, transported unto another quarter of the

House.

II.

THE TRYAL OF SUSANNA MARTIN, AT THE

COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER, HELD BY ADJOURN-

MENT AT SALEM, JUNE
29.
1692.

I.

SUSANNA

MARTIN, pleading Not Guilty to the In-

dictment of Witchcraft, brought in against her, there

were produced the Evidences of many Persons very sensibly
and grievously Bewitched ; who all complained ofthe Prisoner

at the Bar, as the Person whom they believed the cause of

their Miseries.
And now, as well as in the other Trials,

there was an extraordinary Endeavour by Witchcrafts, with

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
139

Cruel and frequent Fits, to hinder the poor Sufferers from

giving
in their Complaints, which the Court was forced

with much Patience to obtain, by much waiting and watch-

ing for
it.

II.
There was now also an account given of what passed

at her first Examination before the Magistrates.
The Cast

of her Eye, then striking the afflicted People to the Ground,
whether they saw that Cast or no

;
there were these among

other Passages between the Magistrates and the Examinate.

Magistrate.
Pray, what ails these People 1

Martin.
I don't know.

Magistrate. But what do you think ails them 1

Martin.
I don't desire to spend my Judgment upon
it.

Magistrate. Don't you think they are bewitch'd 1

Martin.
No, I do not think they are.

Magistrate.
Tell us your Thoughts about them then.

Martin.
No, my thoughts are my own, when they are

in,
but when
they
are
out they
are
anothers.
Their

Master

Magistrate.
Their Master ? who do you think is their

Master 1

Martin.
If they be dealing in the Black Art, you may

know as well as I.

Magistrate.
Well, what have you done towards this ?

Martin. Nothing at all.

Magistrate. Why,
'tis you or your Appearance.

Martin.
I cannot help
it.

Magistrate.
Is it not your Master 1
How comes your

Appearance to hurt these ?

Martin. How do
I know ?
He that appeared in the

HO
THE WONDERS OF

Shape of Samuel, a glorified Saint, may appear in any ones

Shape.

It was then also noted in her, as in others like her, that

if the Afflicted went to approach her, they were flung down

to the Ground.
And, when she was asked the reason of

it, she said, / cannot tell ;
it may be, the Devil bears me

more Malice than another.

III. The Court accounted themselves, alarum'd by these

Things, to enquire
further into
the Conversation
of the

Prisoner ; and see what there might occur, to render these

Accusations .further credible.
Whereupon, John Allen of

Salisbury, testify'd, That he refusing, because of the weak-

ness of his Oxen, to Cart some Staves at the request of this

Martin, she was displeased at it
; and said, It had been as

good that he had ; for his Oxen should never do him much

more Service.
Whereupon, this Deponent said, Dost thou

threaten me, thou old Witch ?
I'l throw thee
into
the

Brook: Which
to
avoid, she flew over
the
Bridge, and

escaped.
But, as he was going home, one of his Oxen

tired, so that he was forced to Unyoke him, that he might

get him home.
He then put his Oxen, with many more,

upon Salisbury Beach, where Cattle did use to get Flesh.

In a few days, all the Oxen upon the Beach were found by

their Tracks, to have run unto the Mouth of Merrimack-

River, and not returned
; but the next day they were found

come ashore upon Plum-Island.
They that sought them,

used all imaginable gentleness, but
they would
still run

away with a violence, that seemed wholly Diabolical,
till

they came
near
the mouth
of Merrimack-River ; when

they ran right into the Sea, swimming as far as they could

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
HI

be seen.
One
of them then swam back
again, with a

swiftness, amazing
to
the
Beholders, who stood ready to

receive him, and help up his tired Carcass
: But the Beast

ran furiously up into the Island, and from thence, thorough

the Marshes, up into Newbury Town, and so up into the
Woods
;
and
there after a while found near Amesbury.

So that, of fourteen good Oxen, there was only this saved
:

The rest were all cast up, some in one place, and some in

another, Drowned.

IV. John Atkinson testifi'd, That he exchanged a Cow

with a Son of Susanna Martin's, whereat she muttered,
and was unwilling he should have
it.
Going to receive

this Cow, tho he Hamstring'd her, and Halter'd her, she,

of a Tame Creature, grew so mad, that they could scarce

get her along.
She broke all the Ropes that were fastned

unto her, and though she were ty'd fast unto a Tree, yet

she made her escape, and gave them such further trouble,

as they could ascribe to no cause but Witchcraft.

V. Bernard Peache testifi'd, That being in Bed, on the

Lord's-day Night, he heard a scrabbling at the Window,
whereat he then saw Susanna Martin come in, and jump
down upon the Floor.
She took hold of this Deponent's

Feet, and drawing his Body up into an Heap, she lay upon
him near Two Hours
;
in all which time he could neither

speak nor stir.
At length, when he could begin to move,

he laid hold on her Hand, and pulling it up to his Mouth,
he bit three of her Fingers, as he judged, unto the Bone.

Whereupon she went from the Chamber, down the Stairs,
out at the Door.
This Deponent thereupon
called unto

the People of the House, to advise them of what passed
;

142
THE WONDERS OF

and he himself did follow her.
The People saw her not
;

but there being a Bucket at the Left-hand of the Door,

tjiere was a drop of Blood found upon it ; and several more

drops of Blood upon the Snow newly fallen abroad
: There

was likewise the print of her 2 Feet just without the Thresh-

old ; but no more sign of any Footing further off.

At another
time
this Deponent was
desired
by the

Prisoner, to come unto an Husking of Corn, at her House ;
and she said, If he did not come, it were better that he did!
He went not
; but the Night following, Susanna Martin,

as he judged, and another came towards him.
One
of

them said, Here he is ! but he having a Quarter-staff, made

a Blow at them.
The Roof of the Barn, broke his Blow;

but following them to the Window, he made another Blow

at them, and struck them down ; yet they got up, and got

out, and he saw no more of them.

About this time, there was a Rumour about the Town,

that Martin had a Broken Head ; but the Deponent could

say nothing to that.

The said Peache also testified the Bewitching the Cattle

to Death, upon Martin's Discontents.

VI.
Robert Downer testified, That this Prisoner being

some Years ago prosecuted at Court for a Witch, he then

said unto her, He believed she was a Witch.
Whereat she

being dissatisfied, said, That some She-Devil would shortly

fetch him away I
Which words were heard by others, as

well
as
himself.
The Night following, as he
lay in
his

Bed, there came in at the Window, the likeness of a Cat,
which flew upon him, took fast hold of his Throat, lay on

him a considerable
while,
and almost
killed him.
At

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
143

length he remembred what Susanna Martin had threatned

the Day before
;
and with much
striving he
cried
out,

Avoid, thou She-Devil!
In the Name of God the Father,

the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Avoid I
Whereupon
it left

him, leap'd on the Floor, and flew out at the Window.

And there also came in several Testimonies, that before

ever Downer spoke
a word
of
this
Accident,
Susanna

Martin and her Family had related, Now this Downer had

been handled /

VII. John Kembal testified, that Susanna Martin, upon

a Causeless Disgust, had threatned him, about a certain
Cow of his, That she should never do him any more Good:

and it came to pass accordingly.
For soon after the Cow

was found
stark dead on
the dry Ground, without any

Distemper to be discerned upon her.
Upon which he was

followed with a strange Death upon more of his Cattle,
whereof he lost in one Spring to the value of Thirty Pounds.
But the said John Kembal had a further Testimony to give

in against the Prisoner which was truly admirable.

Being desirous to furnish himself with a Dog, he applied

himself to buy one of this Martin, who had a Bitch with

Whelps in her House.
But she not letting him have his

choice, he said, he would supply himself then at one.JJlezdels.

Having mark'd a Puppy, which he
lik'd at Blezdels, he

met George Martin, the Husband of the Prisoner, going

by, who asked him, Whether he would not have one of his

Wife's Puppies ? and he answered, No.
The same Day,

one Edmond Elliot,l>emg at Martin's House, heard George
Martin relate, where this Kevibal had been, and what he

had said.
Whereupon /Susanna Martin replied, If I live,

144
THE WONDERS OF

ril give him Puppies enough!
Within a few days after,

this Kembal, coming out of the Woods, there, arose a little

Black Cloud in the N. W. and Kembal immediately felt a

force upon him, which made him not able to avoid running

upon the stumps of Trees, that were before him, albeit he

had a broad, plain Cart-way, before him ; but tho' he had

his Ax also on his Shoulder
to endanger him in his Falls,

he could not forbear going out of his way to tumble over

them.
When he came below the Meeting House,
there

appeared unto him, a little thing like a Puppy, of a Darkish

Colour; and it shot backwards and forwards between his

Legs.
He had the Courage to use all possible Endeavours

of Cutting it with his Ax
; but he could not Hit it
:
the

Puppy gave a jump from him, and went, as to him it seem'd,

into the Ground.
Going a
little further, there appeared

unto him a Black Puppy, somewhat bigger than the
first,

but as Black as a Cole.
Its Motions were quicker than

those of his Ax
;
it flew at his Belly, and away
; then at

his Throat
;
so, over his Shoulder one way, and then over

his Shoulder another way.
His Heart now began to fail

him, and he thought the Dog would have tore his Throat

out.
But he recovered himself, and
called upon God in

his Distress
; and naming the Name of JESUS CHRIST,
it

vanished away
at
once.
The Deponent spoke not one

Word of these Accidents, for fear of affrighting his Wife.

But the next Morning, Edmond Eliot, going into Martin's

House, this Woman asked him where Kembal was ?
He

replied, At home, a Bed, for ought he knew.
She returned,

They say, he was frighted last Night.
Eliot asked, With

what ?
She answered, With Puppies.
Eliot asked, Where

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
145

she heard of it, for he had heard nothing of it ?
She re-

joined, About the Town.
Altho' Kembal had mentioned

the Matter to no Creature living.

VIII.
William Brown
testified, That Heaven having

blessed him with a most Pious and Prudent Wife, this

Wife of his, one day met with Susanna Martin; but when

she approach'd just unto her, Martin vanished out of sight,
and left her extreamly affrighted.
After which time, the

said Martin often appear'd unto her, giving her no little

trouble; and when she did come, she was visited with Birds,

that
sorely peck'd
and
prick'd her
;
and
sometimes, a

Bunch, like a Pullet's Egg, would rise in her Throat, ready

to clioak her,
till she cry'd out,
Witch, you shan't choak

met
While this good Woman was in this extremity, the

Church appointed a Day of Prayer, on her behalf; where-

upon her Trouble ceas'd ; she saw not Martin as formerly
;

and the Church, instead of their Fast, gave Thanks for her

Deliverance.
But a considerable while
after, she
being

Summoned to give in some Evidence at the Court, against

this Martin, quickly thereupon, this Martin came behind

her, while she was milking her Cow, and
said unto
her,

For thy defaming her at Court, I'll make thee the miser-

ablest Creature in the World.
Soon after which, she fell

into a strange kind
of distemper,
and became
horribly

frantick, and uncapable
of any
reasonable Action
;
the

Physicians declaring, that her Distemper was preternatural,
and that some Devil had certainly bewitched her ; and in

that condition she now remained.

IX. Sarah Atkinson
testify'd, That Susanna Martin

came from Amesbury
to
their House at Newbury, in an

L

146
THE WONDERS OF

extraordinary Season, when it was not fit for any to Travel.

She came (as she said, unto Atkinson) all that long way on

Foot.
She brag'd and shew'd how dry she was
; nor could

it be perceived that so much as the Soles of her Shoes were

wet.
A tkinson was amazed at it ; and professed, that she

should her self have been wet up to the knees,
if she had

then came so far ; but Martin reply'd, She scorn'd
to
be

Drabbled!
It was noted, that this Testimony upon her

Trial, cast her in a very singular Confusion.

X. John Pressy testify'd, That being one Evening very

unaccountably
Bewildred, near a
Field
of Martins, and

several times, as one under an Enchantment, returning to

the place he had left, at length he saw a marvellous Light,
about the bigness of an Half-bushel, near two Rod, out of

the way.
He went, and struck at it with a Stick, and laid

it on with all his might.
He gave it near forty blows
; and

felt it a palpable substance.
But going from
it, his Heels

were struck up, and he was
laid with
his Back on the

Ground, sliding, as he thought,
into a Pit
; from whence

he recover'd by taking hold on the Bush ;
altho' afterwards

he could find no such Pit in the place.
Having, after his

Recovery, gone five or six Rod, he saw Susanna Martin

standing on his Left-hand, as the Light had done before ;
but they changed no words with one another.
He
could

scarce find his House in his Return
; but at length he got

home extreamly affrighted.
The next
day,
it was upon

Enquiry understood, that Martin was in a miserable con-

dition by pains and hurts that were upon her.

It was further testify'd by this Deponent, That after he

had given
in some Evidence
against Susanna
Martin,

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
147

mauy years ago, she gave him
foul words about it; and

said, He should never prosper more;
particularly, That he

should never have more than two Cows ; that tho

y he was

never so likely to have more, yet he should never have them.
And that from that very day to
this, namely for twenty

years together, he could never exceed that number ;
but

some strange thing or other still prevented his having any

more.

XI.
Jervis Ring testify 'd, That about seven years ago, he

was oftentimes and grievously oppressed in the Night, but

saw not who troubled him
;
until at last he Lying perfectly

Awake, plainly saw Susanna Martin approach him.
She

came to him, and forceably bit him by the Finger
;
so that

the Print of the bite is now, so long after, to be seen upon

him.

XII. But besides all of these Evidences, there was a

most wonderful Account of one Joseph Ring, produced on

this occasion.

This Man has been strangely carried about by Daemons,

from
one Witch-meeting to another,
for near two years

together;
and
for one
quarter
of
this
time, they have

made him, and keep him Dumb, tho'he is now again able

to speak.
There was one T. H. who having, as 'tis judged,

a
design
of
engaging
this Joseph Ring
in a
snare
of

Devillism, contrived a while, to bring this Ring two Shil-

lings in Debt unto him.

Afterwards, this poor Man would be visited \vith unknown

shapes, and
this T. H. sometimes among them
; which

would force him away with them, unto unknown
Places,

where he saw
Meetings, Feastings, Dancings ; and
after

148
THE WONDERS OF

his return, wherein they hurried him along through the

Air, he gave Demonstrations to the Neighbours,
that he

had indeed been so transported.
When he was brought

until these hellish Meetings,
one of the first Things they

still did unto him, was to give him a knock on the Back,

whereupon he was ever as if bound with Chains, uncapable
of stirring out of the place,
till they should release him.

He related, that there often came to him a Man, who pre-

sented him a Book, whereto he would have him set
his

Hand
; promising to him, that he should then have even

what he would ; and presenting him with all the delectable

Things,
Persons, and Places, that he could imagin.
But

he
refusing
to
subscribe,
the
business would
end with

dreadful Shapes, Noises and Screeches, which almost scared
him out of his Wits.
Once with the Book, there was a

Pen offered him, and an Ink-horn with Liquor in it, that

seemed like Blood
:
But he never toucht it.

This Man did now affirm, That he saw the Prisoner at

several of those hellish Randezvouzes.

Note, this Woman was one of the most impudent, scurri-

lous, wicked Creatures
in the World;
and she did now

throughout her whole Tryal, discover her self to be such an

one.
Yet when she was asked, what she had to say for

her self?
Her chief Plea was,
Ttiat she had lead a most

virtuom and holy Life.

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
149

IV.

THE TRYAL OF ELIZABETH HOW, AT THE

COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER, HELD BY AD-

JOURNMENT AT SALEM, JUNE 30. 1692.

I.

T? LIZABETH HO W pleading Not Guilty to the In-

-C-/
dictment
of Witchcrafts, then
charged upon
her;

the Court, according to the usual Proceedings of the Courts

in England, in such Cases, began with hearing the Depo-

sitions
of several
afflicted
People, who were
grievously

tortured by sensible and evident Witchcrafts, and all com-

plained of the Prisoner, as the cause of their Trouble.
It

was also found that the Sufferers were not able to bear her

Look, as likewise, that in their greatest Swoons, they dis-

tinguished her Touch from other Peoples, being thereby

raised out of them.

And there was other Testimony of People to whom the

shape of this How, gave trouble nine or ten years ago.

II.
It has been a most usual thing for the bewitched

Persons, at the same time that the Spectres representing

the Witches, troubled them, to be visited with Apparitions

of Ghosts, pretending to have been Murdered by the Witches

then represented.
And sometimes the Confessions of the

Witches afterwards acknowledged those very Murders, which

these Apparitions charged upon them ; altho' they had never

heard what Informations had been given by the Sufferers.

150
THE WONDERS OF

There were such Apparitions of Ghosts testified by some

of the present Sufferers; 'and the Ghosts affirmed, that this
How had murdered them
: Which things were fear'd but

not proved.

III.
This How had made some Attempts of joyning to

the Church
at Ipswich,
several years ago;
but she was

denyed an admission into that Holy Society, partly through
a suspicion of Witchcraft, then urged against her.
And

there now came in Testimony, of preternatural Mischiefs,

presently befalling some that had been Instrumental to

debar her from the Communion whereupon
she was
in-

truding.

IV. There was a particular Deposition of Joseph Staf-

ford, That his Wife had conceived an extream Aversion to

this How, on the Reports of her Witchcrafts
: But How

one day, taking her by the Hand, and
saying, / believe

you are not ignorant of the great Scandal that I lye under,

by an
evil Report
raised upon me.
She
immediately,

unreasonably and unperswadeably, even like one Enchanted,

began to take this Woman's part.
How being soon after

propounded, as desiring an Admission to the Table of the

Lord, some of the pious Brethren were unsatisfy'd about

her.
The Elders
appointed a Meeting to hear Matters

objected against her;
and no Arguments
in .the World

could hinder this Goodwife Stafford from
going
to
the

Lecture.
She did indeed promise, with much ado, that

she would not go to the Church-meeting, yet she could not

refrain going thither
also.
How's Affairs there were so

canvased, that she came off rather Guilty than Cleared;

nevertheless Goodwife Stafford could not forbear taking

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
151

her by the Hand, and saying, Tho' you are Condemned

before Men, you are Justified before God.
She was quickly

taken in a very strange manner, Ranting, Raving, Raging,
and crying out, Goody How must come into the Church;

she is a precious Saint ; and tho' she be condemned before

Men, she is Justify'd before God.
So she continued for

the space of two or three Hours; and then fell into a Trance.

But coming to her self, she cry'd out, Ha ! I was mistaken;
and
afterwards again
repeated, Ha ! I was mistaken !

Being asked by
a
stauder by,
Wherein ?
she replyed, /

thought Goody How had been a precious Saint of God, but
now I see she is a Witch:
She has beivitched me, and my

Child, and we shall never be well, till there be a Testimony

for her, that she may
be taken
into
the Church.
And

How said afterwards, that she was very sorry to see Staf-

ford at
the
Church-meeting mentioned.
Sta/ord, after

this, declared herself to be afflicted by the Shape of How;
and from that Shape she endured many Miseries.

V. John How, Brother to the Husband of the Prisoner,

testified, that he refusing to accompany the Prisoner unto

her Examination, as was by her desired, immediately some

of his Cattle were Bewitched to Death, leaping three or

four foot high, turning about, speaking,
falling, and dying

at once
; and going
to
cut
of an
Ear,
for an
use,
that

might as well perhaps have been omitted, the Hand wherein

he held his Knife was taken very numb, and so it remained,
and full of Pain, for several Days, being not well at this

very Time.
And he suspected the Prisoner for the Author

of it.

VI. Nehemiah Abbot
testify 'd, that unusual and mis-

152
THE WONDERS OF

ehievous Accidents would befal his Cattle, whenever he had

any Difference with this Prisoner.
Once, particularly, she

wished his Ox choaked; and within a little while that Ox

was choaked with a Turnep
in
his Throat.
At another

Time, refusing to lend his Horse, at
the
Request of her

Daughter, the Horse was in a preternatural manner abused.
And several other odd things of that kind were testified

VII.
There came
in
Testimony,
that
one
Good-wife

Sherwin, upon some Difference with How, was bewitched
;

and that she dyed, charging this How with having an Hand

in her Death.
And that other People had their Barrels of

Drink unaccountably mischieved,
spoil'd and
spilt, upon

their displeasing of her.

The things in themselves were trivial, but there being

such a Course of them, it made them the more considered.

Among others, Martha Wood, gave her Testimony, That

a little after her Father had been employed
in gathering

an account of flow's Conversation, they once
and again

lost great quantities of Drink out of their Vessels, in such

a manner, as they could ascribe to nothing but Witchcraft.
As also, That How giving her some Apples, when she had

eaten of them she was taken with a very strange kind of

Amaze, insomuch that she knew not what she said or did.

VIII. There was likewise a Cluster of Depositions, That

one Isaac Cummings refusing to lend his Mare unto the hus-

band of this How, the Mare was within a day or two taken in

a strange condition
: The Beast seemed much abused, being

bruised as if she had been
running over the Rocks, and

marked where the Bridle went, as if burnt with a red hot

Bridle.
Moreover, one using a Pipe
of Tobacco
for the

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
153

Cure of the Beast, a blue Flame issued out of her, took

hold of her Hair, and not only spread and burnt on
her,

but
it also flew upwards towards the Roof of the Barn, and

had like to have set the Barn on Fire
: And the Mare dyed

very suddenly.

IX. Timothy Pearley and his Wife, testify'd, Not only

unaccountable
Mischiefs
befel
their
Cattle,
upon
their

having of Differences with this Prisoner : but also that they
had a Daughter destroyed by Witchcrafts ; which Daughter

still charged How as the Cause of her Affliction.
And it

was noted, that she would be struck down whenever How

were spoken of.
She was often endeavoured to be thrown

into the
Fire, and into the Water, in her strange
Fits
:

Tho' her Father had corrected her for charging How with

bewitching her, yet
(as was
testified by others
also) she

said, She was
sure
of
it, and must dye standing
to
it.

Accordingly she charged How to the very Death ; and said,
Tho' How could afflict and torment her Body, yet she could

not hurt her Soul : And, That the Truth of this matter

would appear, when she would be dead and gone.

X.
Francis Lane
testified,
That being
hired by the

Husband of this How to get him a parcel of Posts and

Rails, this Lane hired John Pearly to assist
him.
This

Prisoner then told Lane, That she believed the Posts and

Rails would not do, because John Pearly helped him
: but

that if he had got them alone, without John Pearly 's help,

they might have done well enough.
When James How

came to receive his Posts and Rails of Lane, How taking
them up by the Ends,
they, tho' good and sound, yet un-

accountably broke off, so that Lane was forced to get thirty

154
THE WONDERS OF

or
forty more.
And this Prisoner being informed of
it,

she
said, She told him
so
before, because Pearly helped

about them.

XI.
Afterwards there came in the Confessions of several

other (penitent) Witches, which affirmed this How to be

one of those, who with them had been baptized by the Devil

in the
River, at .A'ewZmry-Falls

:
before which he made

them there kneel down by the Brink of the River and

worshiped him.

V.

THE TRIAL OF MARTHA CARRIER, AT THE

COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER, HELD BY AD-

JOURNMENT AT SALEM, AUGUST
2. 1692.

I.

MARTHA

CARRIER was Indicted for the bewitch-

ing certain Persons, according to the Form usual

in such
Cases,
pleading Not Guilty, to her Indictment ;

there were first brought in a considerable number of the

bewitched Persons ; who not only made the Court sensible

of an horrid Witchcraft committed upon them, but also

deposed, That it was Martha Carrier, or her Shape, that

grievously tormented them, by Biting, Pricking, Pinching
and Choaking of them.
It was further deposed, That while

this Carrier was on her Examination, before the Magis-

trates, the Poor People were
so tortured that every one

expected their Death upon the very spot, but that upon the

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
155

binding of Carrier they were eased.
Moreover the Look

of Carrier then laid the Afflicted People for dead
;
and

her Touch, if her Eye at the same time were
off them,

raised them again
:
Which
Things were
also now seen

upon her
Tryal.
And
it was
testified,
That upon the

mention of some having their Necks twisted almost round,

by the Shape of this Carrier, she replyed, Its no matter

though their Necks had been twisted quite off.

II.
Before the Tryal of this Prisoner, several of her own

children had frankly and fully confessed, not only that they
were Witches themselves, but that this their Mother had
made them so. This Confession theymade with great Shews

of Repentance, and with much Demonstration of Truth.

They related Place, Time, Occasion
; they gave an account

of Journeys, Meetings and Mischiefs by them performed,
and were very credible in what they said.
Nevertheless,

this Evidence was not produced against the Prisoner at the

Bar, inasmuch as there was other Evidence enough to pro-

ceed upon.

III. Benjamin Abbot gave
his Testimony, That
last

March was a twelvemonth, this Carrier was very angry
with him, upon laying out some Land, near her Husband's
:

Her Expressions in this Anger, were, That she would stick

as close to Abbot as the Bark stuck 'to the Tree ; and that

he should repent of it afore seven years came to an End,

so as Doctor Prescot should never cure him.
These Words

were
heard by others
besides Abbot himself; who
also

heard her say, She would hold his Nose as
close
to the

Grindstone as ever it was held since his Name was Abbot.

Presently after
this, he was taken with a Swelling in hia

156
THE WONDERS OF

Foot, and then with a Pain
in
his Side, and exceedingly

tormented.
It bred
into
a
Sore, which was launced by

Doctor Prescot, and several Gallons of Corruption ran out

of
it.
For
six Weeks
it continued very bad, and then

another Sore bred in the Groin, which was also lanced by
Doctor
Prescot.
Another Sore then bred
in
his Groin,

which was likewise cut, and put him to very great Misery
:

He was brought unto Death's Door, and so remained until

Carrier was taken, and
carried away by the
Constable,

from which very Day he began
to mend, and
so grew

better every Day, and is well ever since.

Sarah Abbot
also,
his Wife,
testified, That
her Hus-

band was not only all this while Afflicted in his Body, but

also that strange extraordinary and unaccountable Calamities

befel
his Cattel
;
their Death being such as they could

guess at no Natural Reason for.

IV.
Allin Toothaker
testify 'd, That Richard, the son

of Martha Carrier, having some difference with him, pulFd
him down by the Hair of the Head.
When he Rose again,

he was going to strike at Richard Carrier ; but fell down

flat on his Back to the ground, and had not power to
stir

hand or foot, until he told Carrier he yielded
;
and then

he saw the shape of Martha Carrier, go off his breast.

This Toothaker, had Received a wound
in the Wars ;

and he now testify'd, that Martha Carrier told
him, He

should never be Cured.
Just afore the Apprehending
of

Carrier, he could thrust a knitting Needle into his wound,

four inches deep
;
but presently after her being siezed, he

was throughly healed.

He further
testify'd, that when Carrier and he some-

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
157

times were at variance, she would clap her hands at him,
and say, He should get nothing by it; whereupon he several

times
lost
his
Cattle, by strange
Deaths, whereof no

natural causes could be given.

V. John Rogger also testifyed, That upon the threatning

words of this malicious Carrier, his Cattle would be strangely
bewitched
;
as was more particularly then described.

VI. Samuel Preston testify'd, that about two years ago,

having some difference with Martha Carrier, he lost a Coio

in a strange Preternatural unusual manner
; and about a

month
after
this,
the
said
Carrier,
having again some

difference with him, she told him
; He had lately lost a

Cow, and it should not
be long before he lost another;

which accordingly came to pass;
for he had a thriving and

well-kept Cow, which without any known cause quickly fell
down and dy'd.

VII. Phebe Chandler testify'd, that about a Fortnight

before the apprehension of Martha Carrier, on a Lords-

day, while
the Psalm was
singing
in
the Church,
this

Carrier then took her by the shoulder and shaking her,
asked her, where she lived :
she made her no Answer, al-

though
as
Carrier, who lived next door to her Fathers

House, could not in reason but know who she was.
Quickly

after this, as she was at several times crossing the Fields,
she heard a voice, that she took to be Martha Carriers,
and it seem'd as if it was over her head.
The voice told

her,
she should within two or
three days
be poisoned.

Accordingly, within such a little time, one half of her right

hand, became greatly swollen, and very painful
;
as also

part of her Face
: whereof she can give no account how

158
THE WONDERS OF

it
came.
It
continued very bad
for some dayes
; and

several times since, she has had a great pain in her breast ;
and been so seized on her leggs, that she has hardly been

able to go.
She added, that lately, going well to the House

of God, Richard, the son of Martha Carrier, look'd very

earnestly upon her, and immediately her hand, which had

formerly been poisoned, as is abovesaid, began to pain her

greatly, and she had a strange Burning
at her stomach
;

but was then struck deaf, so that she could not hear any

of the prayer, or singing,
till the two or three last words

of the Psalm.

VIII. One Foster, who confessed her own share in the

Witchcraft for which the Prisoner stood indicted, affirm'd,

that she had seen the prisoner at some of their Witch-meet-

ings, and that it was this Carrier, who perswaded her to

be a Witch.
She
confessed, that the Devil carry'd them

on a pole, to a Witch-meeting
; but the
pole
broke, and

she hanging about Carriers neck, they both fell down, and

she then received an hurt by the Fall, whereof she was not

at this very time recovered.

IX. One Lacy, who likewise confessed her share in this

Witchcraft, now
testify'd, that she and the prisoner were

once Bodily present at a Witch-meeting in Salem Village;
and that she knew the prisoner to be a Witch, and to have

been at a Diabolical sacrament, and that the prisoner was

the undoing
of
her, and her Children, by
enticing them

into the snare of the Devil.

X. Another Lacy, who
also confessed her share in this

Witchcraft, now
testify'd, that
the prisoner was
at the

Witch-meeting, in Salem
Village, where they had Bread

and Wine Administred unto them.

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
159

XI. In the time of this
prisoners
Trial, one Susanna

Sheldon, in open Court had her hands Unaccountably ty'd

together with a wheel-band, so fast that without cutting,

it could not be loosed
: It was done by a Spectre; and the

Sufferer affirm'd,
it was the Prisoners.

Memorandum.
This rampant Hag, Martha Carrier,

was the person, of whom the Confessions of the Witches,
and of her own children among the rest, agreed, That the

Devil had promised her, she should be Queen of ffeb.

HAVING

thus far done the Service imposed upon me ;

I will further pursue
it, by relating a few of those

Matchless CURIOSITIES, with which
the Witchcraft now

upon us, has entertained us.
And I shall Report nothing

but with Good Authority, and what I would invite all my
Readers to examine, while
'tis yet Fresh and New, that if

there
be found any
mistake, it may be
as willingly Re-

tracted, as it was unwillingly Committed.

THE FIRST CURIOSITIE.

I. 'Tis
very Remarkable to see what an Impious and

Impudent imitation of Divine Things,
is Apishly affected

by the Devil, in several of those matters, whereof the Con-

fessions of our Witches, and the Afflictions of our Sufferers
have informed us.

That Reverend and Excellent Person, Mr. John Higgin-

160
THE WONDERS OF

son, in my Conversation with him, Once invited me to this

Reflection
;
that the Indians which came from far to settle

about Mexico, were
in their Progress to that Settlement,

under a Conduct of the Devil, very strangely Emulating
what the Blessed God gave to Israel in the Wilderness.

Acosta, is our Author for
it, that the Devil in their Idol

'

Vitzlipultzli, governed that mighty Nation.
He com-

* manded them to leave their Country, promising to make

* them Lords over all the Provinces possessed by Six other

'Nations of Indians, and give them a Land abounding
'with
all precious
fhings.
They went
forth,
carrying

'their Idol with them,
in a Coffer of Reeds,
supported

'by Four of their Principal Priests; with whom he
still

' Discoursed in
secret, Revealing
to them the Successes,

'and Accidents of their way.
He advised them, when

' to March, and where to Stay, and without his Command-

' ment they moved not.
The first thing they did, where-

' ever they came, was to Erect a Tabernacle, for their false

' god ; which they set always in the midst of their Camp,
'and they placed the Ark upon an Alter.
When they,

' Tired with pains, talked of, proceeding nofurther in their

' Journey, than a certain pleasant Stage, whereto they were

'

arrived, this Devil in one Night, horribly kill'd them that

' had started this Talk, by pulling out their Hearts.
And

' so they passed on till they came to Mexico.'

The Devil which then thus imitated what was in the

Church of the Old Testament, now among Us would Imitate

the Affairs of the Church in the New.
The Witches do say,

that they form themselves much after the manner of Con-

gregational Churches; and that they have a Baptism and a

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
161

Supper,
and
Officers among them,
abominably Resem-

bling those of our Lord.

But there are many more of these Bloody Imitations,
if

the Confessions of the Witches are to be Received ; which

I confess, ought to be but with very much Caution.

What is their stricking down with a fierce Look ?
What

is their making of the Afflicted Rise, with a touch of their
Hand ?
What
is
their
Transportation
thro'
the Air ?

What is their Travelling in Spirit, while their Body is cast

into a Trance ?
What
is their causing
of Cattle to run

mad and perish ?
What is their Entring their Names in a

Book ?
What
is their coming together from all parts, at

the Sound of a Trumpet ?
What is their Appearing some-

times Cloathed with Light or Fire upon them
!
What is

their Covering of themselves and
their Instruments with

Invisibility?
But a Blasphemous
Imitation of
certain

Things recorded about our Saviour or His Prophets, or the

Saints in the Kingdom of God.

A SECOND CURIOSITIE.

II.
In all the Witchcraft which now Grievously Vexes

us, I know not whether anything be more Unaccountable,
than the Trick which the Witches have
to render them-

selves, and their Tools Invisible.
Witchcraft seems to be

the Skill of Applying the Plastic Spirit of the World,
unto some unlawful purposes, by means of a Confederacy
with Evil Spirits.
Yet one would wonder how the Evil

Spirits themselves can do some things ;
especially at In-

visibilizing of the Grossest Bodies.
I can tell the Name

of an Ancient Author, who pretends to show the way, how

a man may come to walk about Invisible, and I can tell the

162
THE WONDERS OF

Name of another Ancient Author, who pretends to Explode

that way.
But I will not speak too plainly Lest I should

unawares Poison some of my Readers, as the pious Hemin-

gius did one of his Pupils, when he only by way of Diver-

sion
recited a
Spell,
which,
they had
said, would cure

Agues.
This much I will say
; The notion of procuring

Invisibility, by any Natural Expedient, yet known,
is I

Believe, a meer PLINYISM
; How far
it may be obtained

by a Magical Sacrament, is best known to the Dangerous
Knaves that have try'd
it.
But our Witches do seem to

have got the knack
: and this
is one of the Things, that

make me think,
Witchcraft will not be fully understood,

until the day when
there
shall not be one Witch in the

World.

There
are
certain people very Dogmatical about these

matters; but I'll give them only these three Bones to pick.

First, One of our bewitched people, was cruelly assaulted

by a Spectre, that, she said, ran at her with a spindle:
tho'

no body else in the Room, could see either the Spectre or

the spindle.
At last, in her miseries, giving a snatch at

the Spectre, she
pull'd the spindle away, and
it was no

sooner got into her hand, but the other people then present,

beheld, that
it was indeed a Real, Proper, Iron sjiindle,

belonging they knew to whom ; which when they lock'd up

very safe,
it was
nevertheless by Demons unaccountably

stole away, to do further mischief.

Secondly, another of our bewitched people, was haunted

with a most abusive Spectre, which came to her, she said,
with a sheet about
her.
After she had undergone a deal

of Teaze, from the Annoyance of the Spectre, she gave a

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
163

violent snatch at the sheet, that was upon it
; wherefrom

she tore a corner, which in her hand immediately became

Visible to a Koomful of Spectators
a palpable Corner of

a Sheet.
Her Father, who was now holding her, catch'd

that he might keep what his Daughter had so strangely

siezed, but the unseen Spectre had
like to have pulPd his

hand off, by endeavouring to wrest it from him
; however

he still held
it, and I suppose has
it, still to show; it being

but a few hours ago, namely about the beginning of this

October, that this Accident happened ;
in the family of one

Pitman, at Manchester.

Thirdly, A young man, delaying to procure Testimonials

for his Parents, who being under confinement on suspicion

of Witchcraft, required him
to do that service for them,

was quickly pursued with odd Inconveniences.
But once

above the Rest, an Officer going to put his Brand on the

Horns of some Coivs, belonging to these people, which tho

he had siez'd for some
of their debts, yet he was willing

to leave in their possession, for the subsistance of the poor

Family ;
this young man help'd in holding the Cows to be

thus branded.
The three first Cows he held well enough
;

but when the hot Brand was clap'd upon the Fourth, he

winc'd and shrunk at such a Rate, as that he could hold

the Cow no longer.
Being afterwards Examined about it,

he confessed, that
at that very instant when the Brand

entered the Cow's Horn, exactly the like burning Brand

was
clap'd upon
his own Thigh ; where he has exposed

the lasting marks of it, unto such as asked to see them.

Unriddle these Things,
Et Eris mihi magnus Apollo.

164
THE WONDERS OF

A THIRD CURIOSITIE.

III. If a Drop of Innocent Blood should be shed, in the

Prosecution of the Witchcrafts among us, how unhappy are
we
!
For which cause, I cannot express myself in better

terms, than those of a most Worthy Person, who lives near

the present Center of these things.
The Mind of God in

these matters, is to be carefully lookt into, with due Cir-

cumspection, that Satan deceive
us not ivith his Devices,

who transforms himself into an Angel of Light, and may

pretend justice and yet intend mischief.
But on the other

side, if the storm of Justice do now fall only on the Heads

of those guilty
Witches and Wretches which have defiled

our Land, How Happy !

The Execution of some that have lately Dyed, has been

immediately attended, with a strange Deliverance of some,

that had
lain
for many
years, in a most sad Condition,

under, they knew not whose evil hands.
As I am abun-

dantly
satisfy'd,
That many
of the
Self-Murders
com-

mitted here, have been the effects of a Cruel and Bloody

Witchcraft, letting fly Demons upon the miserable Seneca's;

thus,
it has been admirable unto me to see, how a Devilish

Witchcraft, sending Devils upon them, has driven many

poor people to Despair, and persecuted their minds, with

such Buzzes of Atheism and Blasphemy, as has made them

even run distracted ivith Terrors : And some long Bow'd
down under such a spirit of Infirmity, have been mar-

velously Recovered upon the death of the Witches.

One Whetford particularly
ten
years
ago, challenging

of Bridget Bishop (whose Trial you have had) with steel-

ing of a Spoon, Bishop threatiied her very direfully

:
pre-

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
165

sently after this, was PFhetford in the Night, and
in her

Bed, visited by Bishop, with one Parker, who making the
Room light at their coming in, there discoursed of several

mischiefs they would inflict upon her.
At last they pull'd

her out, and carried her unto the Sea-side, there to drown

her ;
but she
calling upon God, they
left
her,
tho' not

without Expressions of their Fury.
From that very time,

this poor Whetford was utterly spoilt, and grew a Tempted,

Froward, Crazed sort of a Woman
; a vexation to her self,

and all about her
; and many ways unreasonable.
In this

Distraction she lay,
till those women were Apprehended,

by the Authority; then she began
to mend; and upon

their Execution, was presently and
perfectly Recovered,

from the ten years madness that had been upon her.

A FOURTH CUEIOSITIE.

IV. 'Tis a thousand pitties, that we should permit our

Eyes, to be so Blood-shot with passions, as
to
loose
the

sight of many wonderful things, wherein the Wisdom and

Justice of God, would be Glorify 'd.
Some of those things,

are the frequent ^pparittons of Ghosts, whereby many
Old JHuttoflS among
us, come to be considered.
And,

among many instances of this kind, I will single out one,
which concerned a poor man, lately Prest unto Death, be-

cause of his Refusing to Plead for his Life.
I shall make

an Extract of a Letter, which was written to my Honour-

able Friend, Samuel Setval, Esq. ; by Mr. Putman, to this

purpose ;

' The Last Night my Daughter Ann, was
grievously

1 Tormented by Witches, Threatning that she should be

166
THE WONDERS OF

'Pressed
to
Death, before
Giles
Cory.
But
thro'
the

* Goodness of a Gracious God, she had at last a little Re-

*

spite.
Whereupon there appeared unto her (she said) a

* man in a Winding Sheet, who told her that Giles Gory

* had Murdered him, by Pressing him to Death with his

' Feet ; but that the Devil there appeared unto him, and

' Covenanted with him, and promised him, He should not

l be Hanged.
The
Apparition
said, God Hardned
his

' heart ; that he should not hearken to the Advice of the

' Court, and so Dy an easy Death ; because as it said, It

1 must be done to him as he has done to me.
The Appari-

' tion also said, That Giles Gory, was carry'd to the Court

' for this, and that the Jury had found the murder, and

' that her Father knew the man, and the thing was done

' before she was born. Now Sir, This is not a little strange

* to us ; that no body should Remember these things,
all

' the while
that Giles Gory was in Prison, and
so
often

' before the Court.
For
all people now Remember very

'

well, (and the Records of the Court also mention it,) That

' about Seventeen Years ago, Giles Gory kept a man in his

' House, that was almost a Natural Fool
: which Man Dy'd

'suddenly.
A Jury was
impannel'd upon
him, among

' whom was Dr. Zerobbabel Endicot; who found the man

' bruised to Death, and having dodders of Blood about his

' Heart.
The Jury, whereof several are yet alive, brought

' in the man Murdered ; but as if some Enchantment had

' hindred the Prosecution
of the
Matter, the Court Pro-

' ceeded not against Giles Cory, tho' it cost him a great deal

' of Mony to get off."
Thus the Story.

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.

Direction of His EXCELLENCY the Governour,

Sufferings brought upon the Countrey by Witchcraft
; and

oftheTryals which havepassed upon several Executedfor

the Same :

Upon Perusal thereof, We find the matters of Fact and

Evidence, Truly reported.
And a Prospect given of the

Methods of Conviction, used in
the Proceedings of the

Court at Salem.

BUT

is New-England, the
only Christian
Countrey,

that hath undergone such Diabolical Molestations 1

No, there
are other Good people, that have
in this way

been harassed
;
but none
in circumstances more
like to

Ours, than the people of God, in Sweedland.
The story is

a very Famous one ; and it comes to speak English by the

Acute Pen of the Excellent and Renowned Dr. Horneck.

I shall only single out a few of the more Memorable passages

therein Occurring ; and where
it
agrees with what hap-

pened among ourselves, my Reader shall understand, by
my inserting a Word of every such thing in IftlflCtt Hcttt.

I.
It was in the Year 1669 and 1670, That at Mohra

in Sweedland, the BebtlS by the help of &Httcf)e0, com-

mitted a most horrible outrage.
Among other Instances of

Hellish Tyranny there exercised.
One was, that Hundreds

of their Children, were usually in the Night fetchedfrom their

168
THE WONDERS OF

Lodgings,
to a Diabolical
Rendezvous,
at a place they

called, JBlockula, where the Monsters that so Spirited them,

STemptefc them
all manner of Ways to HsSOCtate with

them.
Yea, such was the perillous Growth of this Witch-

craft, that Persons of Quality began to send their Children

into other Countries to avoid
it.

II. The
Inhabitants
had
earnestly
sought
God
by

Stager ; and get their Affliction <CttttnU&.
Where-

upon ^futigeS had a
Special (ftommiggiOU to find and

root out the Hellish Crew ; and the rather, because another

County in the Kingdom, which had been so molested, was

delivered upon the Execution of the
Witches.

III. The
(^lamination, was begun with
a Day
of

lilumiltatton
;
appointed by Authority.
Whereupon the

Commissioners (EOttSUltiltg, how they might resist such a

Dangerous

Examined ; and tho' they were Questioned (&nt by

what other Witches, in other places had confessed.

the Tops of Houses, to a Green Meadow, where they gave

Only one of them said, That some-

times the Devil only took away her jfcttntgtf), leaving her

i5otJ|) on the ground ; but she went at other times in $3oto,l>

too.

V.
Their manner was to come into the <*Tf)amf)erj3 of

people, and fetch away their children upon
Beasts, of the

Devils providing: promising Jf(M <loatf)S and other

Fine Things unto them,
to
inveagle them.
They said,

they never had power to do thus, till of late ; but now the

Devil did Blague and $3eat them, if they did not gratifie

him, in this piece of Mischief.
They said, they made use

of all sorts of instruments in their Journeys

!
Of JHen ,

of leasts, of posts ;
the Men they commonly laid asleep

at the
place, whereto they rode them ; and
if the
chil-

dren mentioned the ^aitt^S
of them that
stole them

away, they were miserably JJcUtQtftf for
it, until some of

them were killed.
The ^llfcgeS found the marks of the

Lashes on some of them; but the Witches
said,

toOUttJ (QutCfclg bantSf).
Moreover the Children would

be in grange JlFttS, after they were brought Home from

these Transportations.

VI. The jFtCSt 2Tf)mg, they said, they were to do at

Blockula, was to give themselves unto the Devil, and "fcJotO

that they would serve
him.
Hereupon, they rut

as he had, in this Horrid company.
In SOttttf of them, the

J^lark of the CUt jFmger was to be found
; they said,

that the Devil gave Jfteat and J3rink, as to Them, so to

the
Children they brought with them:
that afterwards

170
THE WONDERS OF

their Custom was to Dance before him
; and swear and

curse most horribly ; they said, that the Devil show'd them

a
great, Frightful, Cruel Dragon, telling them, $
tf)0g

Confessed ang Cf)tng t he would
let
loose that Great

Devil upon them ; they added, that the Devil had a (ftljutd) ,
and that when the 3futig# were coming, he told them, f)0

toOUltf
kill

all;
and
that some
of them had

Ettemptetr to JEuttot; tf)e Surges, but coufo not,

VII. Some of the <i)ir&Wt, talked much of a &2itf)tte

&ngel, which did use to ^otfuti them, what the Devil had

bid them to do, and &SSUCC them that these doings would

iB^Ot last long ; but that what had been done was per-
mitted for the wickedness of the People.
This

Ungel, would sometimes rescue the Children,

tn, with the Witches.

VIII. The Witches confessed many mischiefs done by

them, declaring with what kind of ISncfjanteti

they did their Mischiefs.
They sought especially

j^limSter of ElfddU, but could not.
But some of them

said, that such
as they wounded, would %&t
tCCObCttftf,

upon or before their Execution.

IX. The
3fu1jgeS would
fain have
seen them show

some of their CUCftS
;
but they Unanimously declared,

that, Stnce tfjej) fjatr COnfeSSrtr, all, they found all their

gone; and the Devil then gtypearefc berg

unto them, threatning with an iron dFotfc, to

thrust them into a Burning Pit,
if they persisted in their

Confession.

X. There were discovered no
less than threescore and

ten Witches in One Village, tjtee antJ ttoentj) of which

THE INVISIBLE WORLD.
171

their Crimes, were condemned to dy.

The rest, (lie pretending she was with Child) were sent

to Fahluna, where most of them were afterwards executed.

Fifteen Children, which confessed themselves engaged in

this Witchery, dyed as the rest.
Six and Thirty of them

between nine and sixteen years of Age, who had been less

guilty, were forced to run the Gantlet, and be lashed on

their hands once a Week, for a year together;
twenty

more who had less inclination to these Infernal enterprises,
were lashed with Kods upon their Hands for three Sun-

days
together, at the Church door;
the number of the

seduced Children, was about three hundred.
This course,

together with ^tagttJS, in all the Churches thro' the King-

dom, issued in the deliverance of the Country.

XI. The most Accomplished Dr. Horneck inserts a most

wise
caution,
in
his preface
to
this
Narrative,
says
he,

there is no Public Calamity, but some illpeople, will serve

themselves of the sad providence, and make use of it for

their own ends; as Thieves when an house or town is on

Fire, will
steal what they can.
And he mentions a Re-

markable Story of a young Woman,
at Stockholm, in the

year 1676, Who accused her own Mother of being a Witch;
and swore positively, that she had carried her away in the

Night
; the poor Woman was burnt upon
it
:
professing

her innocency to the
last.
But tho' she had been an 111

Woman, yet it afterwards prov'd that she was not such an

one ;
for her Daughter came to the Judges, with hideous

Lamentations,
Confessing, That
she
had
wronged
her

Mother, out of a wicked spite against her; whereupon the

Judges gave order for her Execution too.

THE DEVIL DISCOVERED.

2 Cor. II. 11.
We are not Ignorant of his DEVICES.

OUR

Blessed Saviour has blessed us, with a counsil, as

Wholsome and as Needful as any that can be given

us, in Matth. 26. 41. Watch and Pray, that yee Enter not

into Temptation.
As there
is a Tempting Flesh, and a

Tempting
World, which would seduce us from Our Obe-

dience to the Laws of God, so there is a Busy Demi, who

is by way of Eminency called, The Tempter ; because by

him,
the Temptation
of the Flesh and
the
World
are

managed.

DISCOVERED.
173

It
is not One Devil alone, that has Cunning or Power

enough to apply the Multitudes of Temptations, whereby
Mankind is daily diverted from the Service of God
; No,

the High Places of Our Air, are Swarming
full of those

Wicked Spirits, whose Temptations trouble us ;
they are

so many, that it seems no less than a Legion, or more than

twelve thousands may be spared, for the Vexation of one

miserable man.
But because those Apostate Angels, are

all United, under one Infernal Monarch, in the Designs of

Mischief, 'tis in the Singular Number, that they are spoken

of.
Now,
the
Devil, whose Malice and Envy, prompts

him
to do what he
can, that we may be as unhappy as

himself, do's ordinarily use more Fraud, than Force, in his

assaulting of us ; he that assail'd our First Parents, in a

Serpent, will still Act Like a Serpent, rather than a Lion,

in prosecuting of his wicked purposes upon us, and for us

to guard against the Wiles of the Wicked One,
is one of

the greatest cares, with which our God has charged us.

We are
all of us
liable
to various Temptations every

day, whereby if we are carried aside from the strait Paths

ofRighteousness, we get all sorts of wounds unto our selves.
Of Temptations, I may say, as the Wise Man said, of Mor-

tality ;
there is no discharge from that war.
The Devils

fell hard upon both Adams, nor may any among the Chil-

dren
of both, imagine
to be excused.
The Son of God

Himself, had this Dog of Hell, barking at Him ; and much

more may the Children of Men, look to be thus Visited ;

indeed, there is hardly any Temptation, but what
is, Com-

mon to Man.
When I was considering, how to spend one

Hour in Raising a most Effectual and Profitable Breast-

174
THE DEVIL

work, against
the
inroads of this Enemy, I perceived
it

would be done, by a short answer to this.

CASE.

What are
those Usual Methods of Temptation, with

which the Powers of Darkness do assault the Children of
Men?

The Corinthians, having upon the Apostles Direction,

Excommunicated one of their Society, who had married

his Mother-in-law, & this, as it is thought, while his own

Father was Living too
;
the Apostle
encourages them to

Re-admit that man, upon
his very deep and sharp Re-

pentance.
He
gives divers Reasons of his propounding

this unto them ; whereof one
is, Lest Satan should get ad-

vantage of them ;
for, had the man miscarried, under any

Rigour of the Sentence continued upon him, after his Re-

pentance, 'tis well if the Church itself had not quickly fallen

to pieces thereupon ; besure, the Success of the Gospel had

been more than a little Incommoded.
The Apostle upon

this occasion intimates, That Satan has his Devices ; by
which word are meant, Artifices or Contrivances used for

the Deceiving of those that are Treated with them well, But

what shall we do that we may come
to
this Corinthian

Attainment, We are not Ignorant of Satan's Devices ?\Non

cuivis homini Contingit.^

Truly, the Devil has Mille Nocendi Artes ; and it will

be
impossible
for
us, to
run
over
all
the Stratagems

and
Policies
of our
Adversary.
I
shall
only
attempt

a few Observations upon the Temptations
of our Lord

Jesus
Christ
:
who
was
Tempted
in
all
things
like

DISCOVERED.
175

unto us, except
in our Sins.
When we read the Temp-

tations of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the Fourth Chapter

of Matthew There,
Thence, you
will
understand, what

was once counted so
difficult ; Even, The way of a Ser-

pent upon
the Rock.
There
are
certain
Ancient
and

Famous Methods which
the Devil
in
his
Temptations,

does mostly accustome himself unto; which is not so much

from any .Barrenness,
or
Sluggishness
in the
Devil, but

because he has had the Encouragement of a, Probatum est,

upon those horrid Methods.
How did the Devil assault

the
First Adam?
It was with Temptations drawn from

Pleasure, and Profit, and Honour, which, as the Apostle

notes, in 1 Joh. 2. 16, are, All that is in the World.
With

the very same temptations, it was,
that he fell upon
the

Second Adam too.
Now, in those Temptations, you will

see the more Usual Methods, whereby the Devil would be

Ensnaring of us ; and I beseech you to attend unto the fol-

lowing Admonitions, as those Warnings of God, which the

Lives of your souls depend upon your taking of.

There were
especially Three Remarkable Assaults
of

Temptations, which the Devil it seems, visibly made upon
our Lord ;
after he had been more invisibly for Forty dayes

together Tempting of that Holy One
; and we may make

a few distinct Remarks upon them all.

The
first of our Lords three Temptations
is thus re-

lated, in Mat. 4.
3.
He was an Hungry ; and when the

Tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God,
Command that these Stones be made Bread.

From whence, take these Remarks.

I. The Devil will ordinarily make our Conditions, to be

176
THE DEVIL

the Advantages of his Temptations.
When our Lord was

Hungry, then Bread! Bread!
shall be all the Cry of his

Temptation ; the Devil puts him upon a wrong step, for the

getting of Bread.
There is no Condition, but what has in-

deed some Hunger accompanying of it ; and the Devil marks
what it is, that we are Hungry for.
One mans Condition

makes himHunger for Preferments, or Employments, another
mans makes him Hunger for Cash
or Laud, or Trade
;

another mans makes him Hunger for Merriments, or Diver-

sions
: And the Condition of every Afflicted Man, makes

him Hunger with Impatience for Deliverance.
Now the

Devil will be sure to suit his Perswasions with ourConditions.
When he has our Condition to speak with him, & for him,
then thinks he, / am sure this man will now hearken to my

Proposals!
Hence,
if men are in Prosperity, the Devil

will tempt them to Forgetfulness of God
;
if they are in

Adversity, he will tempt them to Murmuring at God;
in

all the
expressions
of those impieties.
Wise Agur was

aware of this ;
in Prov. 30,
9. says he, if a man be Full,

he
shall be tempted, to deny God, and
say, who
is
the

Lord?
if a man be Poor, he shall be tempted, to steal, and

take the Name of God in vain.
The Devil will talk suit-

ably
;
if you ponder your Conditions, you may expect you

shall be tempted agreeably thereunto.

II. The Devil does often manage his temptations, by

urging of our Necessities.
Our Lord, was thus by
the

Devil bawl'd upon; You want Bread, and you'll starve, if
in my way you get it not.
The Devil will show some for-

bidden thing unto us, and plead concerning it, as of Bread
we use to say, it must be had.
Necessity has a wonderful

DISCOVERED.
177

compulsion in
it.
You may see what Necessity will do, if

you read
in Deut. 2S. 56. The
tender and
the
delicate

Woman among you,
her eye shall
be
evil towards
the

Children that she shall
bear, for she shall eat them for

want of all things.
The Devil will perswade us that there

is a Necessity of our doing what he does propound unto us
;

and then tho' the Laws of God about us were so many Walls

of Stone, yet we shall break through them all.
That little

inconvenience, of our coming to beg our Bread,
what a

fearful Representation does the Devil make of it
! and when

once the Devil scares us to think of a sinful thing, it must be

done, we soon come to think,
it may be done.
When the

Devil has
frighted us
into an Apprehension, that it is a

Needful thing which we are prompted unto, he presently

Engages all the Faculties of our Souls, to prove, that it may

be a Lawful one ; the Devil told Esau, You'll dye if you

don't sell your Birthright ;
the Devil told Aaron,
You'll

pull all the people about your ears, if you do not counte-

nance their superstitions;
and then they comply'd imme-

diately.
Yea,
sometimes
if the Devil do but Feign a

Necessity, he does thereby Gain the Hearts of Men ; he

did but feign a Need, when he told Saul, the Cattel must

be spared, and the sacrifice must be precipitated, & he does

but feign a Need, when he tells many a man, if you do no

servile work on the Sabbath-day, and if you don't Rob
God of his evening, you'll never subsist in the world.
All

the denials of God, in the world, use to be from this Fallacy

impos'd upon
us.
It never can be necassary
for us
to

violate any Negative Commandment
in the Law
of our

God; where God says, thou shalt not, we cannot upon any

N

178
THE DEVIL

pretence reply, I must.
But the Devil will put a most

formidable and astonishing face of necessity upon many of

those Abominable things, which are hateful to the soul of
God.
He'll say nothing to us about, the one thing need-

ful
but the petite and the sorry Need-nots of this world,

he'll set off with most bloody Colours of Necessity.
He

will not say, 'tis necessaryfor you to maintain the Favour

ofyour God, and secure the welfare of your Soul
; but he'll

say, 'tis necessaryfor you to keep in with your Neighbours;
and that you and yours may have a good Living among

them.

III. The Devil does insinuate his most Horrible Temp-

tations, with pretence, of much Friendship and Kindness

for us.
He seemed very unwilling that our Lord should

want any thing that might be comfortable for him
;
but, he

was a Devil still
! The Devil flatters our Mother Eve, as if

he was desirous to make her more Happy than her Maker

did
but there was the Devil in that flattery.
Sub Amid

fallere Nomen,-^
to Salute men with
prefers to do all

manner of Service for them ; and at the same time to Stab

them as Joab did Abner of old; this is just like the Devil,
and the Devil truly has many Children that Imitate him

in
it.
Some very Affectionate Things were spoken once

unto our Lord
;
Lord,
be
it far from
thee,
that thou

shouldest su/er any Trouble!
But our Lords Answer was,

in Mat. 16. 23. Get thee behind me, Satan.
The Devil

will say to a man, / would have thee to Consult thy own

Interest, and I would have Trouble
to be far from. thee.

He speaks these Fair Things, by the Mouths of our pro-

fessed Friends unto
us,
as he
did by the Tongue
of a

DISCOVERED.
179

Speckled Snake unto our Deluded Parents at the first.
But

all this while,
'tis a Direction that has been wisely given

us
;
When he speaks fair, Believe him not, for there are

seven Abominations in his Heart.

IV.
Things in themselves Allowable and Convenient,

are oftentimes turned into sore Temptations by the Devil.
He press'd our Lord unto the making of Bread ; Why,

that very thing was afterwards done by our Lord, in the

Miracles of the Loaves; and yet it is now a motion of the

Devil, Pray, make thyself a Little Bread.
The Devil will

frequently put men
by, from
the doing
of a seasonable

Duty; but how?
Truly by putting us upon another Duty,

which may be at that juncture a most Unseasonable Thing.

It is said in Eccl. 8. 5. A Wise Mans heart discerns both

Time and Judgment.
The Ill-Timing of good Things,

is One
of the
chief Intregues,
which the Devil
has
to

Prosecute.
The Devil himself, will Egg us on to many a

Duty ; and why so ?
But because at that very Time a more

proper and Useful Duty,
will have a Supersedeas given

thereunto.
And,
thus
there
are many Things, whereof

we can say, though no more than this, yet so much as this,

They are Lawful ones, by which Lawful Things
Peri-

mus Omncs.
Where shall we find that the Devil has laid

our most fatal Snares?
Truly, our Snares are on the Bed,

where it is Laivful for us to Sleep
;
at the Board, where

it is Lawful for us to Sit ;
in the Cup, where
'tis Lawful

to Drink; and in the Shops, where we have Lawful Busi-

ness
to
do.
The Devil will decoy
us,
unto the utmost

Edge of the Liberty that is Lawful for us ; and then one

Little push,
hurries us into a Transgression against the

180
THE DEVIL

Lord.
And the Devil by Inviting us to a Lawful thing,

at a wrong time for
it, Layes us under further Entangle-

ment of Guilt before God.
'Tis Lawful for People to use

Kecreations
; but in the Evening of the Lords Day, or the

Morning of
any Day, how
Ensnaring
are they

!
The

Devil then too commonly bears part in the Sport.
If Pro-

miscuous Dancing were Lawful
;
though almost
all the

Christian Churches in the World, have made a Scandal of

it ; yet
for Persons
to go presently from a Sermon to a

Dance, is to do a thing, which Doubtless the Devil makes

good Earnings of.

V. To distrust Gods Providence and Protection,
is one

of the worst things, into which the Devil by his Temptations
would be hurrying of us.
He would fain have driven our

Lord unto a Suspicion of Gods care about Him, said the

Devil, You may dy for lack of Bread, if you do not look

better after your self, than God is like to do for you.
It

is an usual thing for Persons to dispair of Gods Fatherly
Care Concerning them ; they torture themselves with dis-

tracting and amazing Fears, that they shall come to want

before they dy ; Yea, they even say with Jonas, in Chap.

2.
4. / am cast out of the sight of God ; He won't look

after me
!
But it is the Devil that is the Author of all such

Melaneholly Suggestions
in the minds
of men.
It
is a

thought that often raises a Feaver in the Hearts of Married

Persons, when Charges grow upon them ; God will never

be able in the way of my Calling, to feed and cloath all
my Little Folks.
It is a thought with which Aged persons

are often tormented, Tho' God has all my dayes hitherto

supplied me, yet I shall be pinched with Straits before I

DISCOVERED.
181

come to my Journeys end.
'Tis a malicious Devil that

raises these Evil surmisings in the hearts of Men.
And

sometimes a distemper of Body affords a Lodging for the

Devil, from whence he
shoots the
cruel Bombs of such

Fiery Thcwghts into
the minds of many other persons.

With such thoughts does the Devil choose to persecute us ;
because thereby we come
to Forfeit what we Question.

We Question the Care of God, and so we Forfeit
it, until

perhaps the Devil do utterly drown us in Perdition.
Our

God
says, Trust in
the Lord, and do good, and verily

tfiou shalt be fed.
But the Devil says, don't you trust in

God ;
be afraid that you shall not be fed ;
and thus he

hinders men from the doing of Good.

VI.
There is nothing more Frequent in the Temptations

of the Devil, than for our Adoption to be doubted, because

of our Affliction.
When our Lord was in his Penury, then

says the Devil, If thou be the Son of God;
he now makes

an If, of it ;
What ? the Son of God, and not be able to

Command a Bit of Bread!
Thus, when we are in very

Afflictive Circumstances, this will be the Devils Inference,
Tlwu art not a Child of God.
The Bible says in Ileb.

12.
7. If you are Chastened, it is a shrow'd sign that you

can't be Children*
Since he
can't Rob us of our Grace,

he would Rob us of our Joy ; and therefore having Accused

us unto God, he then Accuses God unto us. When Israel

was weak and faint
in the Wilderness, then did Amalek

set upon them
; just so does the Devil set upon the people

of God, when
their Losses, their Crosses, their Exercises

have Enfeebled their Souls within them ; and what says

the Devil 1
E'en the same that was mutter'd in the Ear of

182
THE DEVIL

the Afflicted Job, Is not this the Uprightness of thy Ways ?

Remember, Ipray thee, who ever perished, being Innocent?

If thou wert a Child of God, He would neverfollow thee,
with such
Testimonies of his Indignation.
This is the

Logic of the Devil
; and he thus interrupts that patience,

and that Chearfulness wherewith we should suffer the will

of God.

VII. To dispute the Divine Original and Authority of

Gods Word,
is not the
least of those Temptations with

which the Devil troubles
us.
G-od from Heaven, had

newly said unto our Lord, this
is my Beloved Son ; but

now the Devil would have him to make a dispute of it, //
thou be the Son of God.
The Devil durst not be so Im-

pudent, and Brasen
fac'd,
as to bid men use Pharaohs

Language, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice ?
But he will whisper into our Ears, what he did unto our

Mother Eve of old, It
is not
the Lord that hath spoken

what you call his Word.
The Devil would have men say

unto the Scripture, what they said unto the Prophet, in

Jer. 43. 2. Thou speakest falsely ; the Lord our God hath

not sent thee to speak what thou sayst unto us; & he would

fain have secret & cursed Misgivings in our hearts, that

things are not altogether so as the Scripture has represented

them.
The Devil would with all his heart make one huge

Bonefire of
all the
Bibles
in
the world ; & he has got

Millions of persecutors to assist him in the suppression of

that miraculous book.
It was the devil once in the tongue

of a Papist, that cry'd out, A plague on this bible ;
this

'tis that does all our mischief.
But because he can't Sup-

press this Book, he sets himself, to Disgrace it all that he

DISCOVERED.
183

can.
Altho' the Scripture carries its own Evidence with

it, and be all over, so pure, so great, so true, and so power-

ful, that
it
is impossible
it should proceed from any but

God alone; yet the Devil would gladly bring some Discredit

upon
it, as
if
it were but some Humane Contrivance;

Of nothing, is the Devil more desirous, than this; That we

should not count, Christ so precious, Heaven so Glorious,
Hell so Dreadful, and Sin so odious, as the Scripture has

declared
it.

The Second
of
our
Lords
Three Temptations,
is

related after this manner, in Mat. 4. 5,
6. Then the Devil

taketh him, up, into the Holy City, and setteth him upon
a Pinocle of the Temple ; and saith unto him, if thou be

the Son of God,
cast thy self down ; for
it
is written,

He shall give his Angels charge concerning
thee, and in

their hands, they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou

dash thy Foot against a Stone.

From whence take these Remarks.

I. The places of the greatest Holiness will not secure us

from Annoyance by the Temptations of the Devil, to the

greatest wickedness.
When our Lord was
in the Holy

City, the Devil fell upon him there.
Indeed, there is now no

proper Holiness of Places in our Days ; the Signs and Means

of Gods more special Presence are not under the Gospel,

ty'd unto any certain places:
Nevertheless there are places,

where we use to enjoy much of God ;
and where, altho'

God visit not the Persons for the sake of the Places, yet
he visits the Places for the sake of the Persons.
But, I am to

tell you that the Devil will visit those Places and best Persons

there.
No
Place, that I know
of, has got such a Spell

184
THE DEVIL

upon
it, as will always keep the Devil out.
The Meeting-

House wherein we Assemble
for the Worship of God, is

fill'd with many Holy People, and many Holy Concerns

continually ; but if our Eyes were so refined as the Servant

of the Prophet had his of old, I suppose we should now see

a Throng of Devils in this very place.
The Apostle has

intimated,
that Angels come
in among
us
;
there
are

Angels it seems that hark, how I Preach, and how you

Hear, at this Hour. And our own sad Experience is enough

to
intimate, That the Devils are likewise Rendevouzing

here.
It is Reported, in Job
1. 5. When the Sons of God

came
to present themselves before the Lord, Satan came

also among them.
When we are in our Church-Assemblies,

how many Devils, do you imagine, croud in among us
!

There is a Devil that rocks on to Sleep, there is a Devil

that makes another to be thinking of, he scarce knows what

himself; and
there
is a Devil, that make another, to be

pleasing himself with wanton and wicked
Speculations.

It is also possible, that we have our Closets, or our Studies,

gloriously perfumed with Devotions every day ; but alas,

can we shut the Devil out of them ?
No, Let us go where

we will, we shall still find a Devil nigh unto
us.
Only,

when we come to Heaven, we shall be out of his reach for

ever ;
thou foul Devil ; we are going where tJiou canst

not come ! He was hissed out of Paradise, and shall never

enter
it any more.
Yea, more than
so, when the New

Jerusalem comes down into the High Places of our Air,
from whence the Devil shall then be banished, there shall

be no Devil within the Walls of that Holy City.
Amen,

Even so Lord Jesus, Come quickly.

DISCOVERED.
185

II. Any otheracknowledgments of the Lord Jesus Christ,

will be permitted by the Temptations of the Devil, provided

those Acknowledgments of him, which are True and Full,
may be thereby prevented.
What was
it, that the Devil

hurried our Lord Jesus Christ unto the Top of the Temple

for ?
Surely it could not meerly be to find Precipices; any

part of the Wilderness would have afforded Them.
No,

it was rather to have Spectators.
And why so, Why, the

carnal Jews had an Expectation among them
; that Elias

was
to
fly from Heaven to the Temple
; and the Devil

seems willing, that our Lord should be cry'd up for Elias,
among the giddy multitude ;
or any thing in the World,

tho never so considerable otherwise, rather than to be re-

ceived
as the
Christ
of God.
The Devil will allow his

Followers to think very highly of the Lord Jesus Christ
;

but he is very lothe to have them think, All.
We read

in Col. 1.19. It has pleased the Father

-, that in Him there

should all fulness dwell.
But it is pleasing to the Devil

that we deny something of the Immense Fullness, which

is in our Lord.
The Devil would
confess
to our Lord,

Thou art the Holy One of God! but then he claps in, Thou

art Jesus of Nazareth; which was to conceal our Lords

being Jesus of Bethlehem, and
so
his
being, The True

Messiah.
All the Heresies, and all the Persecutions, that

ever plagued the Church of God, have still been, to strike

at some Glory
of
our Lord Jesus
Christ.
A CHRIST

Entirely Acknowledged,
will save the Souls of them that

so Acknowledge Him ; but, says the Devil, Whatever tides
1 must not give way to that.
As they say, The Devil makes

Witches unable
to
utter
all the Lords Prayer, or some

186
THE DEVIL

such System of Religion, without some Deprevations of it

;

thus the Devil will consent that we may make a very large

Confession of the Lord Jesus Christ
;
only he will have us

to deprave
it,
at
least
in some
one Important
Article.

Some one Honour, some one
Office, and some one Ordi-

nance of the Lord Jesus Christ, must be always left un-

acknowledged, by those that
will do as the Devil would

have them.

III. High Stations in the Church of God, lay men open

to violent and peculiar Temptations of the Devil.
When

our Lord was upon the Pinacle, that
is not the Fane, or

Spire, but the Battlements of the Temple, there did the

Devil pester him, with singular Molestations, and he therein

seems
to intend an Entanglement for the Jews, as well

as for our Lord.
Believe me they that stand High, cannot

stand safe.
The Devil
is a Nimrod, a mighty Hunter ;

and common or little Game, will not serve his Turn
:
he

is a Leviathan, of whom we may say, as
in Job 41. 34.

He, beholds all high things.
Men
of high Attainments,

and Men of high Employments,
in the Church
of God,

must look, like Peter, to be more Sifted, and like Paul, to

be more Bu/eted than other Men.
Ferunt Summos Ful-

mina Monies.
The Devil can raise a Storm, when God

permitteth it, but as for those Men that stand near Heaven,

the Devil will attack them with his most cruel storms of

Thunder and Lightening.
It was said, let him that stand-

eth take heed; but we may say, They that stand most high,
have cause
to
take most
heed.
The Devil
is a Goliah ;

and when he finds a Champion, he'l be sure most fiercely

to Combate such a Man.
He is for, Killing many Birds

DISCOVERED.

with one stone ; and he knows that he shall hinder a world

of Good, and produce a world of III,
if once he can bring

a Man Eminently
Stationed into his Toyls.
Hence
'tis

that the Ministers of God, are more dogg'd by the Devil,

than
other persons
are.
Especially such
Ministers,
as

move in the highest Orb of Serviceableness
; and most of

all such Ministers as have spent many years in Laudable

Endeavours
to be
serviceable;
Those
Ministers are the

Stars of Heaven, at which the Tayl of the Dragon, will

give the most sweeping and most stinging
strokes
;
the

Devil will find that for them, that shall make them Walk

softly
all
their Days.
These
are the Men,
that have

creepled, and vexed the Devil more than other Men
;
for

which the Devil has an old Quarrel with them.
Neigh

bours, little do you think, what black Days of Mourning,
and Fasting, and Praying before the Lord, a Raging Devil

does
fill the lives of such Men of God withall.

IV. The Devil will make a deceitful and unfaithful use

of the Scriptures to make his Temptations forceable. When

the Devil Solicited our Lord, unto an evil thing, he quoted

the Ninety First Psalm unto him, tho' indeed he fallaciously

clip'd
it, and maim'd it, of one clause very material in it.

never does the Devil make such dangerous Passes at us,

as when he does wrest our own Sword out of our Hands,
and push That upon
us.
We have
to defend
us,
that

Weapon in Eph. 6. 16. The Sword of the Spirit, which is

the word of God; but when the Devil has that very Weapon

to fight us with, he makes terrible work of it.
When the

Devil would poyson men with
false Doctrines, he'l quote

Scriptures for them;
a Quaker himself, will have the First

188
THE DEVIL

Chapter of John always in
his mouth.
When the Devil

would perswade men to vile Actions, he'l quote Scriptures

for them ;
he'l encourage men to go on in Sin, by showing

them, where
'tis said, The Lord
is ready to Pardon.
I

say this, The one story of Davids Fall, in the
Scripture,

has been made by the Devil an Engine for the Damnation

of many Millions.
The Devil will fright men from doing

those things, that are, the Things of their Peace; but How ?

He'l turn a Scripture into a Scare-crow
for them.
The

Devil will fright them from all constant Prayer to God, by

quoting that Scripture, The Sacrifice of the Pricked, is an

Abomination to the Lord;
the Devil will fight them from

the Holy Supper of God, by quoting that
Scripture, He

that Eats and Drinks unworthily, Eats and Drinks dam-

nation to himself.
And thus the Devil will by some abused

Scripture, Terrifie the Children of God
; the Scripture is

written as we are told, For our Comfort; but it is quoted

by the
Devil, for our
terror.
How many Godly Souls

have been cast into sinful Doubts and Fears, by the Devils

foolish
glosses upon that
Scripture, He
that
doubts,
is

Damned;
and
that,
the fearful shall have their portion

in the burning lake : The Devil sometimes has play'd the

Preacher, but I say, Beware all silly Souls when such a

Fool is Preaching.

V.
Grievous and Pulling Hurries to Self-Murder are

none
of
the
smallest
outrages, which the Devil
in
his

Temptations commits upon us.
Why did the Devil say to

our Lord, Cast thy self down, but in hopes that our Lord

would have broke his Bones, in the fall?
The Devil is an

Old Murthertr; and he
loves
to Murder men ;
but no

DISCOVERED.
189

Murder gives him so much satisfaction, as that which at

his instigation, men perpetrate upon themselves.
We see

that such as are Bewitched and Possessed by the Devil, do

quickly lay violent hands upon themselves, if they be not

watched continually, and we see that when persons have

begun that Unnatural business of killing themselves, there

is a Preternatural Stupendious Prodigious Assistance, by

the Devil given thereunto.

" When people
are going
to

Harm themselves, we
call upon them, like
those
to the

Jailor, in Acts 1 6. 28. Do thyself no harm!
And we have

this Argument for
it, It
is
the Devil that is dragging of

you to this mischief;
but will you believe,
ivill you obey

such an one as the Devil is ?
What was it that made Judas

to strangle himself 1 We read it was when the Devil was

in him.
I suppose there are few self-murderers, but what

are first very strangely fallen into the Devils hands
; and

possibly,
'tis by some
Extraordinary
Discontent
against

God, or back-sliding from him, that the Devil first entred

into those disturbed Souls.
Indeed, some very great Saints

of God, have sometimes had hideous Royls raised by the

Devil in their minds ; untill they have e'en cry'd out with

Job, I choose strangling rather than Life; and sometimes

the
ill Humours or Vapours in the Bodies of such Good

Men, do so harbour the Devil that they have this woful

motion every day thence made unto them ;
You must kill

your self! you must!
you must!
But
it
is rarely any

other than aSaul, an Abimelek, an Achitophel, or a Judas;

rarely any other, than a very Reprobate, whom the Devil

can drive, while the man is Compos
Mentis, to Consum-

mate such a Villany.
Yea, no Child of God, in his Right

190
THE DEVIL

Senses can go so far in this impiety, as to be left without

all Time and Room for true Repentance of the Crime
;
'tis

thus done, by none but those that go to the Devil.
A

self-murder,
acted by one that
is upon other accounts a

Reasonable man,
is but such an attempt of Revenge upon

the God that made him, as none but one full of the Devil

can be
guilty
of.
If any of you
are Dragoon'd by the

Devil, unto the murdering of your
selves, my Advice to

you
is, Disclose it, Reveal it, make it known immediately.

One that Out his own Throat among us,
Expired crying

out,
that / had told!
that Ihad told! You may spoil

the Devil,
if you'l Tell what he is a doing of.

VI. Presumptuous and Unwarrantable
Trials
of the

Blessed God, are some of those things whereinto the Devil

would fain hook us with his Temptations.
This was that

which the Devil would have brought our Lord unto, even
A tempting of the Lord our God.
It is the charge of our

God upon us, in Deut.
6.
16. Thou shalt not Tempt the

Lord thy God.
But that which the Devil Tries, is, to put us

upon Trying in a sinful way, whether God be such a God

as indeed he
is.
'Tis true as to the ways of Obedience, our

God says unto us, Prove me, in those ways ;
Try, whether

I won't
be as good as my Word.
But then
there
are

ways of Presumption, wherein the Devil would have us to

trie, what a God it
is,
With whom we have to do.
The

Devil would have us to trie the Purpose of God, about our

selves or others ; but how?
By going to the Devil himself ;

by ConsultingA strologers, or Fortune Tellers ; or perhaps by

letting the Bible fall open, to see what is the first Sentence
we light upon.
The De-vil would have us trie the Mercy

DISCOVERED.
191

of God, but how? By running into Dangers, which we have

no call unto.
He would have us trie the Power of God
;

but how?
By looking for good things, without the use of

Means for the getting of them.
He would have us
trie

the Justice of God ; but how?
By venturing upon Sin in

a Corner, with an Imagination that God will never bring

us out.
He would have us trie the Promise of God ; but

how?
By Limiting the Lord, unto such or such a way of

manifesting Himself, or
else believing of nothing
at
all.

He would have us trie the Threatning of God
; but how ?

By going on impeuitently
in those things,
for which the

Wrath of God comes upon the Children of Disobedience.

Thus would the Devil have us to affront the Majesty of

Heaven every day.

VII. The Temptations of the Devil, aim at puffing and

bloating of us up, with Pride;
as much perhaps as any

one iniquity.
The Devil would have had Our Lord make

a Vain glorious Discovery of himself unto the World, by

Flying in ike
air,
so
as no mortal
can.
Hoc Ithacus

velit
the Devil would have us to soar aloft, and not only

to be above other men, but also to know that we are so,
Pride is the Devils own sin
; and he
affects especially to

be, The King over the Children of Pride, it is a caution in

1 Tim.
3.
6.
A Pastor must not
be A Novice ;
Lest

being lifted up with Pride, He fall into the condemnation

of the Devil.
(Summo ac Pio cum Tremore Hunc Textum

Legamus nos Ministri Juvenes!)
Accordingly, the Devil

would have us
to be inordinately taken and moved with

what Excellencies our God has bestowed upon us.
If our

Estates rise, he would have us rise in our Spirits too.
If

192
THE DEVIL

we have been
blessed with Beauty, with Breeding, with

Honour, with
Success, with Attire, with
Spiritual Privi-

ledges, or with Praise-worthy Performances; Now
says

the Devil, Think thy self better than other Men.
Yea, the

Devil would have us arrogate unto our selves, those Ex-

cellencies which really we were never owners of ; and Boast

of a false Gift.
He would have us moreover
to Thirst

after Applause among others that may see Our Excellencies!

and be impatient if we are not accounted some-body.
He

would have us furthermore, to aspire after such a Figure,

as God has never yet seen
fitting for us
; and croud into

some High Chair that becomes us not.
Thus would the

Devil Elevate us into the Air, above our Neighbours
; and

why so 1
'Tis that we may be punished with such Falls, as

may make us cry out with David,
my bones are broken

with my Falls!
The Devil can't endure to see men lying

in the Dust; because there is no falling thence.
He is a

Fallen Spirit himself, and it pleases him to see the Falls

of men.

The Third of Our Lords Three
Temptations,
is
re-

lated in such Terms as these.
Matth.
4.
8,
9. Again the

Devil taketh him up, into an exceeding High Mountain,
and sheweth him all the Kingdoms of the world, and tlie

glory of them : and saith unto him, all these things ivill

give thee, if thou wilt fall down and Worship me.
Froi

whence take these Remarks.

I. The Devil in his Temptations will set the Delight

this world before us ; but he'll set a fair, and a false Vamis

upon those Delights.
They were some unknown Perspt

tives, which the Devil had, both for the Refracting of the

DISCOVERED.
193

Medium, and for the Magnifying of the
Object, whereby

he gave our Lord at once a prospect of the whole Roman

Empire ;
but what was it ?
It was the World, and the

Glory of
it ;
he says not a word of the World, and the

Trouble of it.
No sure ;
not a word of that ;
the Devil

will not have his Hook so barely expos'd unto us.
The

Devil sets off the Delights of Sin, which he offers unto us,
with
a
stretched and raised Rhetorick ;
but he will not

own, That in the midst of our Laughter, our Hearts shall

be sorrowful ; and That the end of our Mirth shall
be

Heaviness.
There is but one Glass in the Spectacles, with

which the Devil would have us to read, those passages in

Eccles.
11.
9. Rejoyce,
young Man in thy youth, and

let thy Heart chear thee in the Dayes of thy youth, and

walk in the ways of thy Heart, and in the sight of thine

Eyes.
Thus far the Devil would have us to Read ;
and

he'll make many a fine Comment upon
it ;
he'll
tell us,

That
if we
follow the
Courses
of the World, we shall

swim
in
all the Delights
of the World.
But he is not

willing you should Read out the next words ; But know

thou, that for all these things God shall bring thee into

Judgment.
he's loth we should be aware of the dreadful

Issues, and Reckonings that our Worldly Delights will be

attended with.
He sets before us, The Pleasures of Sin;

but he will not say, These are but for a Season.
He sets

before us, The Sweet Waters of Stealth ;
but he will not

say, There is Death in the Pot.
He is a Mountebank, that

will bestow nothing but Romantic Praises upon all that he

makes us the Offers of.

II.
There are most Hellish Blasphemies often buzz'd by

194
THE DEVIL

the Temptations of the Devil, into the minds of the best
Men alive.
What a most Execrable Thing was here laid

before our Lord Himself: Even, To own the Devil as God!

a thing that can't be uttered, without unutterable Horror

of Soul.
The best man on
earth, may have such Fiery

Darts from Hell shot into his mind.
One that was acted

by the Devil, had the impudence
to propound this unto

such
a good man
as Job,
Curse
God.
And
the Devil

pleases himself, by chusing the Hearts of good men, with

his base Injections, That there is no God, or, That God is

not a Righteous God; and a thousand more such things

too Devilish to be mentioned.
A good man is extreamly

grieved at
it, when he hears a Blasphemy from the mouth

of another man;
said the Psalmist, in Psal. 44. 15,
16.

My Confusion is continually before me, for the
voice of

him that Blasphemeth.
But much more when a good man

finds a Blasphemy in his own Heart ;
it throws him into

most Fevourish Agonies of Soul.
For this cause, a mis-

chievous Devil, will Flie Bloiv the Heart of such a man,
with such Blasphemous Thoughts, as make him crie
out,

Lord, I am e'en weary of my life.
Yea, the Devil serves

the man
just
as
the
Mistress
of Joseph
dealt
with

him

;
he
importunes
the man
to think wickedly from

Day
to Day
;
and
if
the man
refuse,
he
cries out
at

last, Behold, what wicked thoughts this man has lodging

in him.
Sayst
thou
so?
Satan!
No, they are
Baits

of thy own
; and at thy Door alone shall they be laid for

ever.

III. There
is a
sort
of
Witchcrafts
in those
things,

whereto the Temptations of the Devil would inveigle us.

DISCOVERED.
195

To worship the Devil is Witchcraft, and under that notion

was our Lord urged unto sin.
We are told in 1 Sam. 15.

23. Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft : When the Devil

would have us to sin, he would have us to do the things
which the forlorn Witches use to
do.
Perhaps there are

few persons,
ever allured by the Devil unto an Explicit

Covenant with himself.
If any among ourselves be so, my

councel
is, that you hunt the Devil from you, with such

words as the Psalmist had, Be gone, Depart from me, ye

evil doers,for I ivill keep the Commandments of my God.

But alas, the most of men, are by the Devil put upon doing

the
things
that
are Analogous
to the worst
usages
of

Witches. The Devil says to the sinner, Despise thy Baptism,
and
all
the Bond of
it, and
all the Good of it.
The

Devil
says
to the
sinner,
Come, cast
off the Authority

of
God, and
refuse
the
Salvation of Christ for
ever.

Yea, the Devil who
is
called, The God of
this World,

would have us
to
take Him
for
our God,
and
rather

Hear Him, Trust Him, Serve Him, than the God that

formed us.

IV. The Temptations of the Devil do Tug and Pull for

nothing
more, than
that the Rulers
of the World may

yield Homage unto him.
Our Lord has had this by his

Father
Engag'd
unto
him,
That
he
shall
one day
~be

Governour of the Nations.
The Devil doe's extreamly

dread
the approach
of that
Illustrious time, when The

Kingdom of God shall come, and his Will be done, as in

Heaven, and on Earth.
For this cause it was that he was

desirous, Our Lord should rather have accepted of him, that

Kingdom, which Antichrist afterwards accepted of him, for

196
THE DEVIL

the Establishment of Devil-worship, in the World.
I may

tell you, The D.evil is mighty unwilling, that there should

be one Godly Magistrate upon the
face
of the
Earth.

Such
is the influence of Government, that the Devil will

every where stickle mightily, to have that siding with him.
What Rulers would the Devil have, to command all man-

kind, if he might have his will ?
Even, such as are called

in Psal. 94. 20. The throne of iniquity, whichframes mis-

chief by a Law ;
such
as
will promote
Vice, by both

Connivance, and Example
;
and such as will oppress
all

that shall be Holy, and Just, and Good.
All men have

cause
therefore
to be jealous, what Use the Devil may

make of them, with reference to the Affairs of Government ;
but Rulers may most
of
all think, that the Lord Jesus

from Heaven calls upon them, Satan has desired that he

might Sift you, and have you ;
look
to
it, what side

you take.

Thus have you in the Temptations of our Lord, seen the

principal of those Devices, which the Devil has to Entrap

oui' Souls.
But what
shall we now do, that we may be

fortified against those Devices 1
that we might be well

furnished with the WholeArmour of God !
But me thinks,

there were some things attending the Temptations of our

Lord, which would especially Recommend those few Hints

unto us for our Guard.

First, If you are not fond of Temptation, be not fond of

Needless, or Too much Retirement.
Where was it, that the

Devil fell upon our Lord ?
it was when he was Alone in the

Wilderness.
We should
all have our Times to be Alone

DISCOVERED.
197

every Day ; and
if the Devil go
to scare us
out of our

Chambers, with such a Bugbear, as that
he'll appear
to

us, yet stay in spite of his teeth, stay to finish your Devo-

tions ; he Lyes, he dare not shew his head.
But on the

other-side by being too solitary, we may lay our selves too
much open to the Devil
; You know who says, Wo to him

that is alone.

Secondly, Let an Oracle of God be your defence against

a Temptation of Hell. How did our Lord silence the Devil ?

It was with an, It is ivritten!
And all his Three Citations

were from that one Book of Deuteronomy.
What a full

Armoury then have we, in all the
sacred Pages that
lie

before us
!
Whatever the Words of the Devil are, drown

them with the words of the Great God.
Say, It is Written.

The Belshazzar of Hell
will Tremble and Withdraw, if

you show these Hand- Writings of the Lord.

Lastly, Since the Lord Jesus
Christ has conquered all

the Temptations of the Devil, Flie to that Lord, Crie to

that Lord, that He would give you a share in his Happy

Victory.
It was for Us that our Lord overcame the Devil
:

and when he did but say, Satan, Get hence, away presently

the Tygre flew : Does the Devil molestUs ?
Then let us Re-

pair to our Lord,who says,7knowhow to succour the Tempted.

Said the Psalmist, Psal. 61.2. Lead me to the Rock that is

higher than I.
A Woman in this Land being under the

Possession of Devils, the Devils within her, audibly spoke

of diverse Harms they would
inflict upon her ; but still

they made
this answer, Ah! She Runs
to
the Rock/

She Runs
to
the Rock! and that hindered all.
this

198
THE DEVIL DISCOVERED.

Running
to
the Rock;
'tis the best Preservation
in the

World ; the
Vultures of Hell cannot prey upon the Doves

in the
Clefts of that Rock.
May our God now lead us

thereunto.

A TRUE
NARRATIVE
of some
Remarkable

Passages relating to sundry Persons afflic-

ted by
Witchcraft
at Salem Village
in

New-England, which happened from the

I9th. of March to the 5th. of April, 1692.

COLLECTED BY DEODAT LAWSON.

the Nineteenth day of March last I went

to Salem Village, and lodged at Nathaniel

Ingersol's
near
to
the
Minister
Mr.
P.'s

House, and presently
after I came into my

Lodging, Capt.
Walcut's Daughter Mary came to Lieut.

IngersoVs and spake
to me ;
but suddenly after, as she

stood by the Door, was bitten, so that she cried out of her

Wrist, and looking on it with a Candle, we saw apparently
the marks of Teeth, both upper and lower set, on each side

of her Wrist.

In the beginning of the Evening I went to give Mr. P.

a Visit.
When
I
was
there,
his Kinswoman, Abigail

Williams, (about
1 2 Years
of Age) had a grievous fit
;

she was at first hurried with violence to and
fro
in
the

202
THE EXAMINATION OF THE

Room (though
Mrs.
Ingersol endeavoured
to
hold
her)

sometimes making
as if she would
fly, stretching up her

Arms as high as she could, and
crying.
Whisli,
Whish,

Whish, several times
;
presently after she said, there was

Goodw. N. and
said, Do you not
see her ?
Why there

she stands!
And she
said, Goodw. N. offered her THE

BOOK, but she was resolved she would not take it, saying

often, / wont, I wont, I wont take it, I do not know what
Book it is : I am sure it is none of God's Book,
it is the

Devil's Book for ought I know.
After that, she ran to

the Fire, and began to throw Fire-brands about the House,
and run against the Back, as if she would run up Chimney,

and, as they said, she had attempted to go into the Fire in

other Fits.

On Lords Day, the Twentieth
of March,
there were

sundry of the afflicted Persons at Meeting, as Mrs. Pope,
and Goodwife Bibber, Abigail Williams, Mary Walcut,
Mary Lewes, and Doctor Grigg's Maid.
There was also

at Meeting, Goodw ife
(7. (who was aUeiward Examined

on
suspicion
of being a Witch:
They had
several
sore

Fits in the time of Publick Worship, which did something

interrupt me in my first Prayer, being so unusual.
After

Psalm was sung, A bigail Williams said to me, Now stand

up, and name your Text!
And
after
it was
read,
she

said, It is a long Text. In the beginning of the Sermon, Mrs.

Pope, a Woman afflicted, said to me, Now there is enough

of
that.
And
in
the
Afternoon,
Abigail
Williams,

upon my referring
to my Doctrine,
said
to me, / know

no Doctrine you had, If you did name one, I have for-

got
it.

NEW-ENGLAND WITCHES.
203

In Sermon time, when Goochvife C. was present in 'the

Meeting-House, Ah. W. called out. Look where Goodwife

C. sits on the Beam suckling her Yellow Bird betwixt her

fingers/ Ann Putman, another Girle afflicted, said, There
was a Yellow Bird sat on my Hat as it hung on the Pin

in the Pulpit; but those that were by, restrained her from

speaking aloud about it.

On Monday the
2lst. of March,
the
Magistrates
of

Salem appointed to come to Examination of Goodwife C.
And about Twelve of the Clock they went into the Meet-

ing-House, which was thronged with
Spectators.
Mr.

Noyes began with a very pertinent and pathetical Prayer;
and Goodwife
C.
being
called
to answer
to what was

alledged against her, she desired to go to Prayer, which was
much wondred
at, in the presence of so many hundred

People
: The Magistrates told her, they would not admit

it ; they came not there to hear her Pray, but to Examine

her, in what was Alledged against
her.
The Worshipful

Mr. Hathorne asked her, Why she afflicted those Children ?

She said, she did not afflict them.
He asked her, who did

then?
She
said, / do not know; How should I know?

The Number of the
Afflicted Persons were
about
that

time
Ten,
viz.
Four Married Women,
Mrs. Pope,
Mrs.

Putman,
Goodwife
Bibber,
and
an
Ancient Woman,

named Goodall; three Maids, Mary Walcut, Mercy Lewes,

at Thomas Putman's, and a Maid at Dr. Griggs's;
there

were three Girls from 9 to
1 2 Years of Age, each of them,

or thereabouts,
viz. Elizabeth Parris, Abigail Williams,

and Ann Putman ;
these were most of them at Goodwife

C.'s Examination, and did vehemently Accuse her in the

204
THE EXAMINATION OF THE

Assembly of Afflicting them, by Biting, Pinching, Strang-

ling, &c.
And that they in their Fits see her Likeness

coming to them, and bringing a Book to them
; she said

she had no Book ;
they affirmed, she had a Yellow Bird,

that used to suck betwixt her Fingers, and being asked

about it, if she had any Familiar Spirit, that attended

her

? she said, She had no Familiarity with any such thing.

She was a Gospel Woman
: Which Title she called her self

by ; and the Afflicted Persons told her,
Ah
!
she was A

Gospel Witch.
Ann Putman did there affirm, that one

day when Lieutenant Fuller was at Prayer at her Father's

House, she saw the shape of Goodwife C. and she thought
Goodwife N. Praying at the same time to the Devil;
she

was not sure it was Goodwife N., she thought it was ; but

very sure she saw the shape of Goodwife C.
The said C.

said, they were poor distracted Children, and no heed
to

be given to what they said.
Mr. Hathorne and Mr. Noyes

replyed, It was the Judgment of all that were present, they
were Beivitched, and only she
the Accused Person
said,

they were Distracted.
It was observed several times, that

if she did but bite her under lip in time of Examination,
the Persons afflicted were bitten on their Arms and Wrists,
and produced the Marks before the Magistrates, Ministers,
and others.
. And being watched for that,
if she did but

Pinch her Fingers, or Grasp one Hand hard in another,

they were Pinched, and produced the Marks before the

Magistrates, and Spectators.
After that, it was observed,

that if she did but lean her Breast against the Seat in the

Meeting-House, (being the Bar at which she stood), they
were afflicted.
Particularly Mrs. Pope complained of griev-

NEW-ENGLAND WITCHES.
205

ous Torment in her Bowels, as if they were torn out.
She

vehemently accused the
said
C. as the Instrument, and

first threw her Muff at her
; but that flying not home, she

got off her shoe, and hit Goodwife
(7. on the Head with
it.

After these Postures were watched,
if the said C. did but

stir her Feet, they were afflicted in their Feet, and stamped

fearfully.
The afflicted Persons asked her, why she did not

go
to the Company of Witches which were
before the

Meeting-House Mustering 1
Did she not hear the Drum

beat ?
They accused her of having Familiarity with the

Devil, in the time of Examination, in the shape of a Black
Man whispering
in
her Ear;
they
affirmed,
that
her

Yellow Bird sucked betwixt her Fingers in the Assembly;
and Order being given to see
if there were any sign, the

Girl that saw it, said, it was too late now ; she had removed

a Pin, and put it on her Head; which was found there stick-

ing upright.

They told
her, she had Covenanted with the Devil for

ten Years, six of them were gone, and four more to come.

She was required by the Magistrates to answer that Ques-

tion in the Catechism, How many persons be there in the

God-head ?
She answered it but oddly, yet was there no

great thing to be gathered from it ; she denied all that was

charged upon her, and said, They could notprove a Witch;

she was that Afternoon Committed to Salem Prison; and

after she was in Custody, she did not so appear to them,
and afflict them as before.

On Wednesday the 23d. of March, I went to Thomas

Putman's, on purpose to see his Wife
:
I found her lying

on the Bed,
having had a sore Fit a
little before;
she

THE EXAMINATION OF THE

spake to me, and
said, she was glad to see me ; her Hus-

band and she both desired me to Pray with her while she
was sensible
; which I did, though the Apparition said, /

should not go
to Prayer.
At
the
first
beginning
she

attended
; but after a little time, was taken with a Fit ;

yet
continued
silent, and seemed
to
be Asleep :
When

Prayer was done, her Husband going to her, found her in

a Fit; he took her off the Bed, to set her on his Knees,
but at first she was so
stiff, she could not be bended
; but

she afterwards sat down, but quickly began to strive vio-

lently with her Arms and Leggs ; she then began to Com-

plain
of, and
as
it
were
to
Converse Personally
with,

Goodwife N. saying, Goodivife N.
Be gone 1 Be gone /

Be gone / are you not ashamed, a Woman of your Pro-

fession, to afflict a poor Creature so ?
What hurt did I

ever do you in my life ?
You have but two Years to live,

and then the Devil will torment your Soul ; for this your
Name is blotted out of God's Book, and it shall never be

put in God's Book again ; be gone for shame, are you not

afraid of that which is coming upon you ?
7 know, I

know what will make you afraid ;
the wrath ofan Angry

God, I am sure that will make you afraid
be gone, do

not torment me, I know what you would have (we judged

she meant, her Soul) but it is out of your reach ;
it is

cloathed with the white Robes of Christ's Righteousness.

After this, she seemed to dispute with the Apparition about

a particular Text of Scripture.
The Apparition seemed

to deny, it
;
(the Womans Eyes being
fast closed all this

time) she said, She was sure there was such a Text, and

she would tell it
; and then the Shape would be gone, for,

NEW-ENGLAND WITCHES.
207

said she, / am sure you cannot stand before that Text !

Then she was
sorely Afflicted, her Mouth drawn on one

side, and her Body strained for about a Minute, and then

said, / will
tell, I will tell ;
it is, it
is, it is, three or four

times, and then was afflicted to hinder her from telling, at

last she broke forth, and said, It
is the third Chapter of

the Revelations.
I did something scruple the reading it,

and did let my scruple appear, lest Satan should make any

Superstitiously to improve the Word of the Eternal God.

However, tho' not versed in these things, I judged I might
do it this once for an Experiment.
I began to read, and

before I had near read through the first Verse, she opened

her Eyes, and was well
;
this Fit continued near half an

hour.
Her Husband and the Spectators told me, she had

often been so relieved by reading Texts that she named,

something pertinent
to her Case;
as Isa. 40.
1. Isa. 49.

1. Isa. 50.
1. and several others.

On Thursday the Twenty-Fourth of March,
(being
in

course the Lecture-Day at the Village,) Goodwife N. was

brought before the
Magistrates Mr.
Hathorne and Mr.

Corwin, about Ten
of the Clock in the Forenoon, to be

Examined in the Meeting-House, the Reverend Mr. Hale

begun with Prayer, and the Warrant being read, she was

required to give Answer, Why she Afflicted those persons ?

She pleaded her own Innocency with earnestness.
Thomas

Putman'sWife, Abigail Williams, and Thomas Putman's

Daughter, accused
her that
she
appeared
to
them, and

afflicted them in their Fits
; but some of the others said,

that they had
seen her, but knew not that ever she had

hurt them ;
amongst which was Mary Walcut, who was

208
THE EXAMINATION OF THE

presently after she had so declared bitten, and cryed out of

her in the Meeting-House, producing the Marks of Teeth

on her wrist.
It was so disposed, that I had not leisure to

attend the whole time of Examination, but both Magistrates
and Ministers
told me, that the things
alledged by the

afflicted, and defences made by her, were much after the

same manner as the former was.
And her motions did

produce
like
effects,
as
to Biting,
Pinching,
Brusing,

Tormenting, at their Breasts, by her Leaning, and when

bended back, were as if their Backs were broken.
The

afflicted Persons said, the Black Man whispered to her in

the Assembly, and therefore she could not hear what the

Magistrates said unto
her.
They said also, that she did

then ride by the Meeting-House, behind the Black Man.
Thomas Putmaris Wife had a grievous Fit in the time of

Examination, to the very great impairing of her strength,
and wasting of her spirits, insomuch as she could hardly
move hand or foot when she was carried out.
Others also

were there grievously afflicted, so that there was once such

a hideous scrietch and
noise (which I heard as I walked

at a little distance from the Meeting-House) as did amaze

me, and some that were within, told me the whole Assem-

bly was struck with Consternation, and they were afraid,

that those that sate next to them were under the Influence

of Witchcraft.
This Woman also was that day committed

to Salem Prison.
The Magistrates and Ministers also did

inform me, that
they apprehended a Child of Sarah G.

and examined
it, being between 4 and 5 years
of Age.

And as to matter of Fact, they did unanimously
affirm,

that when this Child did but cast its Eye upon the afflicted

NEW-ENGLAND WITCHES.
209

Persons, they were tormented ; and they held her Head,
and yet so many as her Eye could fix upon were afflicted.
Which they did several times make careful Observation of:
The afflicted complained, they had often been Bitten by

this Child, and produced the marks of a small set of teeth

accordingly ; this was also committed to Salem Prison, the

Child looked hail, and well as other Children.
I saw it

at
Lieut.
Jngersol's.
After the Commitment of Goodw.

N. Tho. Putman's Wife was much better, and had no vio-

lent Fits at
all from that '24th. of March, to the 5th. of

April.
Some others also said they had not seen her so

frequently appear to them, to hurt them.

On
the 25 th.
of March
(as
Capt. Stephen Sewal of

Salem did afterwards inform me) Eliz. Paris had sore Fits

at his House, which much troubled himself, and his Wife,
so as he told me they were almost discouraged.
She re-

lated, that the great Black Man came to her, and told her,

if she would be ruled by him, she should have whatsoever

she desired, and go to a Golden City.
She relating this to

Mrs. Sewal,
she told the Child,
it was the Devil, and he

was a Lyarfrom the Beginning, and bid her tell him so,

if he came again
: which she did accordingly, at the next

coming to her, in her Fits.

On the 2$th. of March, Mr. Hathorne, Mr. Corwin, and

Mr. Higison, were
at the Prison-Keeper's House to Ex-

amine the
Child, and
it
told them there,
it had a little

Snake that used to suck on the lowest Joynt of
its Fore-

Finger; and when they enquired where, pointing to other

places,
it told them, not there, but there, pointing on the

lowest Joint of the Fore-Finger, where they observed a

p

210
THE EXAMINATION OF THE

deep Red Spot, about the bigness of a Flea-bite ; they asked
who gave it that Snake ?
whether the great Black Man ?

It said no,
its Mother gave it.

The 31
of March there was a Publick Fast kept
at

Salem on account of these Afflicted Persons.
And Abigail

Williams said, that the Witches had a Sacrament that day

at an house in the Village, and that they had Red Bread

and Pied Drink.
The first of April, Mercy Lewis, Thomas

Putman's Maid, in her Fit, said, they did eat Red Bread,

like Man's Flesh, arid would have had her eat some, but

she would not
; but turned away her
head, and
spit
at

them, and
said, / will not Eat, I will not Drink,
it
is

Blood, &c., she said, That is not the Bread of Life;
that

is not the Water of Life;
Christ gives the Bread of Life;

I will have none of it ! The first ofApril also Mercy Lewis

aforesaid saw in her Fit a White Man, and was with him

in a glorious
Place, which had no Candles nor Sun, yet

was full of Light and Brightness; where was a great Multi-

tude in White glittering Robes, and they Sung the Song

in the fifth of Revelation, the 9th verse, and the 1W Psalm,
and the 149 Psalm; and said with her self, How long shall
I stay here !
let me be along with you :
She was loth to

leave this place, and grieved that she could tarry no longer.
This white Man hath appeared several times to some of

them, and given them notice how long it should be before

they had another Fit, which was sometimes a day, or day
and half, or more or less,
it hath fallen out accordingly.

The 3d of April, the Lord's-day, being Sacrament-day,

at
the Village, Goodw. C, upon Mr. Parris's naming his

Text, John 6, 70.
One of them is a Devil, the said Goodw.

NEW-ENGLAND WITCHES.
211

C. went immediately out of the Meeting-House, and flung
the Door
after her
violently,
to the amazement of the

Congregation.
She was afterwards seen by some in their

Fits, who said,
Goodw. C. I did not think to see you here /

(and being at their Red Bread and drink) said to her, Is

this a time to receive the Sacrament, you ran away on the

Lord's-Day, and scorned
to
receive
it in
the Meeting-

House^ and, Is this a time to receive it ?
I wonder at you!

This is the sum of what I either saw my self, or did receive

Information from persons
of undoubted Reputation and

Credit.

REMARKS OF THINGS MOEE THAN ORDINARY ABOUT THE

AFFLICTED PERSONS.

1. They are in their Fits tempted
to be
Witches, are

shewed the List of the Names of others, and are tortured

because they will not yeild to Subscribe, or meddle with, or

touch the BOOK, and are promised to have present Relief

if they would do it.

2. They did in the Assembly mutually Cure each other,

even with a Touch of their Hand, when Strangled, and

otherwise Tortured
; and would endeavour to get to their

Afflicted, to relieve them.

3. They did also foretel when anothers Fit was a-coming,

and would say, Look to her!
she will have a Fit presently,

which fell out accordingly, as many can bear witness, that

heard and saw
it.

4. That
at the same
time, when the Accused Person

was
present, the Afflicted Persons saw
her Likeness in

212
TEE EXAMINATION OF THE

other places of the Meeting-House, sucking her Familiar,
sometimes in one place and posture, and sometimes in an-

other.

5. That their Motions in their Fits are Preternatural,

both as to the manner, which is so strange as a well person
could not Screw their Body into ; and as to the violence

also
it is preternatural, being much beyond the Ordinary

force
of the same
person when they
are
in
their right

mind.

6. The eyes of some of them in their fits are exceeding

fast
closed, and
if you ask a question they can give no

answer, and I do believe they cannot hear at that time, yet
do they plainely converse with the Appearances, as if they
did discourse with real persons.

7. They are utterly pressed against any persons Pray-

ing with them, and
told by the Appearances, they shall

not go
to Prayer,
so
Tho. Putman's wife was
told^ /

should not Pray; but she said, / should: and after I had

done, reasoned with the Appearance, Did not I say he should

go to Prayer?

8. The forementioned Mary W. being a little better at

ease, the Afflicted persons said, she had signed the Book ;
and that was the reason she was
better.
Told me by

Edward Putman.

REMAEKS CONCERNING THE ACCUSED.

1 . For introduction to the discoveiy of those that afflicted

them, It is reported Mr. Parris's Indian Man, and Woman,
made a Cake
of Eye
Meal,
and the
Childrens
water,

NEW-ENGLAND WITCHES.
213

baked it in the Ashes, and gave
it to a Dog, since which

they have discovered, and seen particular persons hurting
of them.

2.
In Time of Examination, they seemed little affected,

though all the Spectators were much grieved to see it.

3. Natural Actions
in them produced Preternatural

actions in the Afflicted, so that they are their own Image
without any Poppits of Wax or otherwise.

4. That they are accused to have a Company about 23

or 24 and they did Muster in Armes, as it seemed to the

Afflicted Persons.

5.
Since they were confined, the Persons have not been

so much Afflicted with their appearing to them, Biteing or

Pinching of them, &c.
.

6. They are reported by the Afflicted Persons to keep

dayes of Fast and dayes of Thanksgiving, and Sacraments;
Satan endeavours to Transforme
himself to an Angel of

Light, and to make his Kingdom and Administrations to

resemble those of our Lord Jesus Christ.

7.
Satan Rages
Principally amongst the Visible Sub-

jects of
Christ's Kingdom and makes
use
(at
least
in

appearance)
of some
of them
to
Afflict
others
;
that

Christ's Kingdom rtiay be divided against it self, and so be

weakened.

8.
Several things used in England at Tryal of Witches,

to the Number of 14 or 15 which are wont to pass instead

of, or in Concurrence with Witnesses, at least 6 or 7 of them

are found in these accused
:
see Keebles Statutes.

9. Some of the most solid Afflicted Persons do affirme

the same things concerning seeing the accused out of their

Fitts as well as in them.

A FURTHER ACCOUNT
OF THE TRYALS OF

THE NEW-ENGLAND WITCHES, SENT IN A LETTER FROM

THENCE, TO A GENTLEMAN IN LONDON.

HERE

were in Salem, June 10, 1692, about 40 per-

sons that were
afflicted with horrible torments by

Evil Spirits, and the
afflicted have accused 60 or 70 as

Witches, for that they have Spectral appearances of them,

tho
the
Persons
are
absent when
they are
tormented.

When
these Witches were Tryed,
several of them
con-

fessed a contract with the Devil, by signing his Book, and

did express much sorrow for the same, declaring also their

Confederate Witches, and said the Tempters of them desired

'em to sign the Devils Book, who tormented them till they
did it.
There were at the time of Examination, before

many hundreds of Witnesses, strange Pranks play'd
;
such

as the taking Pins out of the Clothes of the afflicted, and

thrusting them into their flesh, many of which were taken

out again by the Judges own hands.
Thorns also in like

kind were thrust into their flesh
;
the accusers were some"

times
struck dumb, deaf, blind, and sometimes lay as if

they were dead for a while, and
all foreseen and declared

by the afflicted just before
't was done.
Of the afflicted

NEW-ENGLAND WITCHES.
215

there were two Girls, about 12 or 13 years of age, who

saw
all
that
was
done,
and were
therefore
called the

Visionary Girls;
they would say, Now he, or she, or they,

are going to bite orpinch the Indian; and all there present

in Court saw
the
visible marks on
the Indians arms
;

they would also cry out, Now look, look, they are going to

bind such an ones Legs, and all present saw the same per-

son spoken
of,
fall with her Legs
twisted
in an
extra-

ordinary manner; Now
say they, we
shall
all
fall, and

immediately 7 or 8 of the afflicted fell down, with terrible

shrieks and
Out-cry's:
at
the
time
when
one
of
the

Witches was sentenced, and pinnion'd with a Cord, at the

same time was the
afflicted Indian Servant going home,

(being about 2 or 3 miles out of town,) and had both his

Wrists at the same instant bound about with a like Cord,

in
the same manner as she was when she was sentenc'd,

but with that violence, that the Cord entred into his flesh,

not to be untied, nor hardly cut
Many Murders
are

suppos'd to be in this way committed ; for these Girls, and

others of the afflicted, say, they see Coffins, and bodies in

Shrowds,
rising up, and looking on the accused, crying,

Vengeance,
Vengeance on the Murderers
Many other

strange things were transacted before the Court in the time

of their Examination ;
and
especially one thing which
I

had like to have forgot, which is this, One of the accus'd,

whilst the rest were under Examination, was drawn up by
a Rope to the Roof of the house where he was, and would

have been choak'd in all probability, had not the Rope been

presently cut ;
the Rope hung
at the Roof by some in-

visible tye, for there was no hole where
it went up
; but

216
THE EXAMINATION OF THE

after
it was cut the remainder
of
it was found in the

Chamber just above, lying by the very place where it hung
down.

In December
1692, the Court sate again at Salem in

New-England, and cleared about 40 persons suspected for

Witches, and Condemned
three.
The Evidence against

these three was the same as formerly, so the Warrant for

their Execution was sent, and the Graves digged for the

said three, and for about
five more that had been Con-

demned
at Salem
formerly, but were Reprieved by the

Governour.

In the beginning of February 1693, the Court sate at

Charles-Town where
the Judge exprest himself to
this

effect.

That who it was that obstructed theExecution ofJustice,

or kindred those good proceedings they had made, he knew

not, but thereby the Kingdom of Satan was advanced, &c.
and the Lord have mercy on this Country
: and so declined

coming any more into Court.
In hig absence Mr. D

sate as Chief Judge 3 several days, in which time 5 or 6

were clear'd by Proclamation, and almost as many by Trial;

so that all are acquitted.

The
most
remarkable
was
an
Old Woman
named

Dayton, of whom it was said, If any in the World were a

Witch, she was one, and had been so accounted 30 years.

I had the Curiosity to see her tried ;
she was a decrepid

Woman of about 80 years of age, and did not use many
words in her own defence.
She was accused by about 30

Witnesses ; but the matter alledged against her was such

as needed
little apology, on her part not one
passionate

NEW-ENGLAND WITCHES.
217

word, or immoral action, or evil, was then objected against
her for .20 years past,
only strange accidents
falling out,

after some Christian admonition given by her, as saying,
God would not prosper them, if they wrong

1d the Widow.

Upon
the whole, there was not proved against her any

thing worthy of Reproof, or just admonition, much less so

heinous a Charge.

So that by the Goodness of God we are once more out

of present danger of this Hobgoblin Monster ; the stand-

ing Evidence used
at Salem
were
called,
but
did
not

appear.

There were others also at Charles-town brought upon

their Tryals, who had formerly confess'd themselves to be

Witches;
but upon their tryals deny'd
it, and were
all

clear'd ; So that at present there is no furtherprosecution

of any.

CHRISTIAN READER.

SO

Odious and Abominable is the Name of a Witch, to

the Civilized, much more the Religious part of Man-

kind, that it is apt to grow up into a Scandal for any, so

suspecting, or too precipitant Judging of Persons on this

account.
But certainly, the more execrable the Crime ve,

the more critical care is to be used in the exposing of the

Names, Liberties, and Lives of Men (especially ofa Godly

Conversation) to the imputation of it.
The awful hand of

God now upon us, in letting loose of evil Angels among us

to perpetrate such horrid Mischiefs, and suffering ofllelTs
Instruments to do such fearful things as have been scarce

heard of; hath put
serious persons into deep Musings,

and upon curious Enquiries what is
to
be done for
the

detecting and defeating of this tremendous design of the

grand Adversary: And, tho' all that fear God are agreed,
That no evil is to be done, that good may come of it ;
yet

hath the Devil obtained not a little of his design, in the

divisions of Reuben, about the application of this Rule.

That there are Devils and Witches, the Scripture asserts,

222
TO THE READER.

and experience confirms, That they are common enemies

of Mankind, and set upon mischief] is not to be doubted:

That the Devil can (by Divine Permission) and often doth

vex men in Body and Estate, without the Instrumentality

of Witches, is undeniable: That he often hath, and delights

to have the concurrence of Witches, and their consent in

harming men,
is consonant to his native Malice to Many

and too lamentably exemplified: That Witches, when de-

tected and convinced, ought to be exterminated and cut off,

we, have God's warrant for, Exod. 22. 18.
Only the same

God who hath said, thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live ;
hath also said, at the Mouth
of two Witnesses, or three

Witnesses
shall he
that
is worthy of Death, be put
to

Death
: But at the Mouth of one Witness, he shall not be

put to Death, Deut.

Much debate is made about

what is sufficient Conviction, and some have (in their Zeal)

supposed that a
less clear evidence ought to pass in this

than in other Cases, supposing that else it will be hard (if

possible) to bring such to condign Punishment, by reason

of the close conveyances that
there are between the Devil

and Witches;
but
this a very dangerous and unjustifi-

able tenet.
Men serve God in doing their Duty, he never

intended that all persons guilty of Capital Crimes should

be discovered and punished by men in
this
Life, though

they be never so curious in searching after Iniquity.
It

is therefore exceeding necessary that in such a day as this,
men be informed what
is Evidence and what is not.
It

concerns men in point of Charity ; for the? the most shin-

ing Professor may be secretly a most abominable Sinner,

yet
till he
be detected,
our Charity
is bound
to Judge

TO THE READER.
223

according to what appears : and notwithstanding that a

clear evidence must determine a case ;
yet presumptions

must be weighed against presumptions, and Charity is not

to be forgone as long as it has the most preponderating on

its side. And it is of no less necessity in point of Justice;

there are not only Testimonies required by God, which are

to be credited according
to
the Rules given in his Word

referring to witnesses: But there is also an Evidence sup-

posed
to be in the Testimony, which is throughly
to
be

weighed, and if it do not infallibly prove the Crime against

the person accused, it ought not to determine him guilty of

it; for so a righteous Man may be Condemned unjustly.
In the case of Witchcrafts we know that the Devil is the

immediate Agent in the Mischief done, the consent or com-

pact of the PFitch is the thing to be Demonstrated.

Among many Arguments
to
evince
this, that ivhich is

most under present debate, is that which refers to some-

thing vulgarly called Spectre Evidence, and a certain sort

of Ordeal or tryal by the sight and touch.
The principal

Plea to justifie the convictive Evidence in these,
is fetcht

from the Consideration of the Wisdom and Righteousness

of God in Governing the World, which they suppose would

fail, if such things were permitted
to befal an innocent

person:
but
it
is
certain,
that
too
resolute
conclusions

drawn from
hence, are
bold usurpations upon
spotless

Sovereignty

: and tho

} some
things if suffered to be con-

mon, would subvert this Government, and disband, yearuine

yet God doth sometimes
suffer such

things to evene, that we may thereby know how much we

are beholden to him, for that restraint which he lays upon

224
TO THE READEE.

the Infernal Spirits, who would else reduce a World into
a Chaos.
That the Resolutions of such Cases as these is

proper for the Servants of Christ in the Ministry cannot

be denied;
the seasonableness of doing
it now, will
be

justified by the Consideration of the necessity there is at

this time of a
right Information of men's Judgments

about these things, and
the danger of their being misin-

formed.

The Reverend, Learned, and Judicious Author of the

ensuing Cases, is too well known to need our Commenda-

Consent to, and Concurrence with the substance of what is

contained

:
And,
with
our

hearty Request to God, that he would discover the depths

of this Hellish Design; direct in the whole management of

this Affair ; prevent
the taking any wrong steps in this

dark way ; and that he would in particular Bless tliese

faithful Endeavours of his Servant to that end, we Com-
mend it and you to his Divine Benediction.

CASES OF CONSCIENCE CONCERNING

WITCHCRAFTS.

E
First Case that I am desired to express

my Judgment
in,
is this, Whether
it
is not

Possible for
the
Devil
to
impose
on
the

imagination of Persons Bewitched, and
to

cause them to Believe that an Innocent, yea that a Pious

person does torment them, when
the Devil himself doth

it ; or whether Satan may not appear in the Shape of an

Innocent and Pious, as well as of a Nocent and Wicked

Person, to Afflict such as suffer by Diabolical Molestations?

The Answer to the Question must be Affirmative ; Let

the following Arguments be duely weighed in the Ballance

of the Sanctuary.

Argu.
1.
There
are several Scriptures from which we

may infer the Possibility of what is Affirmed.

1. We
find that the Devil by the Instigation of the

Witch at Endor appeared in the Likeness of the Prophet
Samuel.
I am not ignorant that some have asserted that,

which, if it were proved, would evert this Argument, viz.

that it was the true and not a delusive Samuel which the

Witch brought
to converse with Saul.
Of this Opinion

Q

CASES OF CONSCIENCE

are
some
of
the Jewish Rabbles1
and some
Christian

Doctors2 and many late Popish Authors3 amongst whom

Cornel, a Lapide is most elaborate.
But that
it was a

Daemon representing Samuel has been evinced by learned

and Orthodox Writers
:
especially *Peter Martyr,

5Baldu-

inus QLavater, and our incomparable John Rainolde.
I

shall not here insist on the clearing of that, especially con-

sidering, that elsewhere I have done it
: only let me add,

that the Witch said to Saul, I see Elohim,
i.e. A God ;

(for the whole Context shows, that a single Person
is in-

tended)
Ascending out of the Earth.
1 Sam.
28.
13.

The Devil would be Worshipped as a God, and Saul now,

that he was become a Necromancer, must bow himself to

him.
Moreover, had it been the true Samuel from Heaven

reprehending Saul,
there is great Reason to believe, that

he would not only have reproved him for his
sin, in not

executing Judgment on the AmaleJcites;
as in Ver. 18.

But for his Wickedness in consulting with Familiar Spirits

:

For which Sin it was in special that he died.
2 Chron. 10.

13.
But in as much as there
is not one word to testify

against that Abomination, we may conclude that it was not

real Samuel that appeared to Saul : and
if
it were the

Devil
in
his
likeness,
the Argument seems very strong,

that
if the Devil may appear in the form of a Saint in

Glory, much more is it possible for him to put on the like-

ness of the most Pious and Innocent Saint on Earth.

are, who acknowledge that a Dcemon may appear in the

shape of a Godly Person, But not as doing Evil.
Wherffls

the Devil in Samuel's likeness told a pernicious Lye, when

he said, Thou hath disquieted me.
It was not in the Power

of Saul, nor of all the Devils in Hell, to disquiet a Soul in

Heaven, where Samuel had been for two years before this

Apparition.
Nor did the Spectre speak true, when he said,

Thou and thy Sons shall be with me : Tho' Saul himself at

his Death went to be with the Devil, his Son Jonathan did

not so.
Besides, (which suits with the matter in hand) the

Devil in Samuels shape confirmed Necromancy and Cursed

Witchery.
He that can in the likeness of Saints encourage

Witches
to Familiarity with
Hell, may possibly
in the

likeness of a Saint afflict a Bewitched Person.
But this

we see from Scripture, Satan may be permitted to do.

And whereas
it
is objected, that the Devil may appear

indeed in the form of Dead Persons, but that he cannot re-

present such as are living ; The contrary is manifest.
No

question had Saul said to the Witch, bring me David who

was then living, she could as easily have shown living David

as dead Samuel, as easily as that great Conjurer of whom

^JVierus
speaks, brought the appearance
of Hector and

Achilles, and
after that
of David before the Emperour

Maximilian.

And that evil Angels have sometimes appeared
in the

likeness
of living absent persons, is a thing abundantly

confirmed by History.

2'Austin tells us of one that went for resolution in some

intricate Questions to a Philosopher, of whom he could get

CASES OF CONSCIENCE

no Answer; but in the Night the Philosopher comes to him,
and resolves all his Doubts.
Not long after, he demanded

the reason why he could not answer him in the Day as

well as in the Night
;
The Philosopher professed he was

not with him
in the Night, only acknowledged that he

dreamed of his having such
conversation of his Friend,

but he was all the time at home, and asleep.
Paulus and

Palladius did both of them profess to Austin, that one in

his shape, had divers times, and in divers places appeared

to them
:
l Thyreus mentions several Apparitions of absent

living persons, which happened in his time, and which he

had the certain knowledge
of.
A Man that is in one place

cannot (Autopro&opos) at the same time be in another.
It

remains then that such Spectres are Prodigious and Super-

natural, and not without Diabolical Operation.
It has been

Controverted
among
Learned
Men,
whether
innocent

Persons may not by the malice and deluding Power of the

Devil be represented as present amongst Witches at their

dark Assemblies.
The mentioned Thyreus says, that the

Devil may, and often does represent the forms of Innocent

Persons out
of those
Conventions, and that there
is no

Question to be made of it, but as to his natural Power and

Art he
is able to make their shapes appear amongst his

own Servants, but he supposeth the Providence of God will

not suffer such an Injury to be done to an Innocent Person.
With him 2Delrio, and Spineus concur.
But Cumanus in

his Lucerna Inquisitorium (I Book which I have not yet

seen)
defends the
Affirmative
in
this
Question.

Fieldius
in
his
Treatise,
concerning
the
Confession
of

Witches,
inclines to the Negative, only

Jhe acknowledges

Die extraordinaria Permissioneposse Innocences sic repre-

sentari.
And he that
shall assert, that Great and Holy

God never did nor ever will permit the Devil thus far to

abuse an Innocent Person, affirms more than he is able to

prove. The story of Germanus his discovering a Diabolical

illusion of this nature, concerning a great number of Persons

that seemed
to be
at a Feast when they were really at

home and asleep, is mentioned by many Authors.
But the

particulars insisted on, do sufficiently evince the Truth of

what we assert,
viz. That the Devil may by Divine Per-

mission appear in the shape of Innocent and Pious Persons.

Nevertheless, It
is
evident from another
Scripture,
viz.

that in 2 Cor. 11. 14.
For. Satan himself is transformed

into an Angel of Light.
He seems to be what he is not,

and makes
others seem
to be what they
are
not.
He

represents evil men as good, and good men as evil.
The

Angels
of Heaven, (who
are the Angels of Light)
love

Truth and Righteousness, the Devil will seem to do so too ;
and does
therefore sometimes
lay
before men
excellent

good
Principles and
exhort
them
(as he did Theodore

Maillit) to practise many things, which by the Law
of

Righteousness they are obliged unto, and hereby he does

more effectually deceive.
Is
it not
strange,
that he has

sometimes intimated to his most devoted servants, that if

they would have familiar Conversation with him, they must

be
careful to keep themselves from enormous
Sins,
and

pray
constantly for Divine Protection?
But
so has he

1 De Confcs. Say. pag. 191.

230
CASES OF CONSCIENCE

transformed himself into an Angel of Light, as lBoissardm

sheweth.
He has frequently appeared to Men pretending

to be a good Angel, so to Anatolius of old ; and the late

instance of 2Dr. Dee and Kellet are famously known. How

many deluded Enthusiasts both in former and latter times

have been imposed on by Satans appearing visibly to them,

pretending to be a good Angel.
And moreover, he may

be said to transform himself into an Angel ofLight, because

of his appearing in the Form of Holy Men, who are the

Children ofLight, yea in the shape and habit of Eminent

Ministers of God.
So did he appear to Mr. Earl of Colches-

ter in the likeness of Mr. Liddal an Holy Man of God, and

to the Turkish Chaous Baptized at London, Anno 1658.

pretending to be Mr. Dury an Excellent Minister of Christ.
And how often has he pretended to be the Apostle Paul or

Peter or some other celebrated Saint?
Ecclesiastical His-

tories abound with Instances of this nature.
Yea, some-

times he has transfigured himself into the Form of Christ.

It is reported that he appeared to 3St. Martin Gloriously

arrayed, as if he had been Christ.
So likewise to *Secun-

dellus, and to another Saint, who suspecting it was Satan,

transforming himself into an Angel ofLight had this expres-

sion, If I may see Christ in Heaven it is enough, I desire

not to see him in this World ; whereupon the Spectre van-

ished.
It has been related of Luther, that after he had been

Fasting and Praying in his Study, the Devil came pretend-

231

ing to be Christ, but Luther saying, away thou co-nfounded

Devil, I acknowledge no Christ but what is in my Bible,

nothing more was seen.
Thus then the Devil is able (by

Divine Permission) to change himself into what form or

figure he pleaseth,

Omnia transformat sese in miracula rerum.

A Third Scripture to our purpose is that, in Rev. 12. 10.

where the Devil
is called the Accuser of the Brethren.

Such is the malice and impudence of the Devil, as that he

does accuse good Men, and that before God, and that not

only of such Faults as they really are guilty of, he accused

Joshua with his filthy Garments, when through his Indul-

gence some
of his Family had transgressed by unlawful

Marriages, Zach.
3.
23. with Ezra 10.
18. but also with

such Crimes, as they are altogether free from.
He repre-

sented the Primitive Christians as the vilest of men, and

as if at their Meetings they did commit the most nefandous

Villanies that ever were known ; and that not only Inno-

cent, but Eminently Pious Persons should thro' the malice

of the Devil be accused with the Crime of Witchcraft, is no
new thing.
Such an Affliction did the Lord see meet to

exercise the great Athanasius with,

1 only the Divine Pro-

vidence did wonderfully vindicate him from that as well as

from some other foul Aspersions.
The Waldenses
(altho'

the Scriptures
call them Saints, Rev. 13.
7.) have been

traduced by Satan and by theWorld as horrible Witches ; so

have others in other places, only because they have done ex-

traordinary things by their Prayers
:
It is by many Authors

CASES OF CONSCIENCE

related, that a City in France was molested with a Diabolical

Spectre, which the People were wont to call Hugon; near

that place a number of Protestants were wont to meet to

serve God, whence
the Professors of the true reformed

Pteligion were nic-named Hugonots, by the Papists, who

designed to render them before the World, as the Servants

and Worshippers of ih&tDcemon, that went under the name

of Hugon,
And how often have I read in Boobs written

by Jesuits, that Luther was a Wizard, and
that he
did

himself confess that he had familiarity with Satan
! Most

impudent Untruths
!
nor are these things to be wondered

at, since the Holy Son of God himself was reputed a Magi-

cian, and one that had Familiarity with
the
greatest of

Devils.
The Blaspheming Pharisees said, he casts out the

Devils thro' the Prince of Devils, Matth. 9. 34.
There is

then
not the best Saint on Earth (Man or Woman) that

can assure themselves that the Devil shall not cast such an

Imputation upon them.
It is enough for the Disciple that

he be as his Master, and the Servant as his Lord : If they
have called the Master of the House Beelzebub, how much

more them of his Household, Matth. 10. 25.
It is not for

men to determine how far the Holy God may permit the

wicked one
to proceed
in
his Accusations.
The sacred

story of Job giveth us to understand, that the Lord whose

ways are past finding
out, does
for wise and
holy Ends

suffer Satan by immediate Operation, (and consequently by

Witchcraft) greatly to afflict innocent Persons, as in their

Bodies and Estates, so in their Reputations.
I shall men-

tion but one Scripture more to confirm the Truth in hand
:

It is that in Eccles. 9. 2, 3. where it is said, All things come

233

alike to all, there is one event to the Righteous and to the

Wicked, as is the Good, so
is the Sinner, this
is an evil

amongst all things under the Sun, that there is one Event

happeneth to all.
And in Secies. 7. 15. 'tis said, There is

a just man that perisheth in his Righteousness.

From hence we infer, that there is no outward Affliction

whatsoever but may befal a good Man ; now to be repre-

sented by Satan as a Tormentor of Bewitched or Possessed

Persons, is a sore Affliction to a good man.
To be tormented

by Satan is a sore Affliction, yet nothing but what befel Job,
and a Daughter
of Abraham, whom we read of in the

Gospel

: To be represented by Satan as tormenting others,

is an Affliction like the former ; the Lord may bring such

extraordinary Temptations on his own Children, to afflict

and humble them, for some Sin they have been guilty of

before him.
A most wicked Person
in
St.
Ives, got a

Knife, and went with it to a Ministers House, designing to

stab him, but was disappointed; afterwards Conscience

being awakened,
the Devil appears to this Person in the

Shape of that Minister, with a Knife in his hand exhorting

to Self-murder
: Was not here a Punishment suitable to

the Sin which that Person had been guilty of?
Perhaps

some of those whom Satan has represented as committing

Witchcrafts, have been tampering with some foolish and

wicked Sorceries, iiho' not to that degree, which
is Criminal

and Capital by the Laws both of God and Men ;
for this

Satan may be permitted so to scourge them ; or it may be,

they have misrepresented and abused others, for which cause

the Holy God may justly give Satan leave falsely to repre-

sent them.

234
CASES OF CONSCIENCE

Have we not known some that have bitterly censured

all that have been complained of by bewitched
Persons,

saying it was impossible they should not be guilty
; soon

upon which themselves or some near Relations of theirs,
have been to the lasting Infamy of their Families, accused

after the same manner, and Personated by the Devil
! Such

tremendous Rebukes on a few, should make all men to be

careful how they joyn with Satan in Condemning the In-

nocent.

Arg. 2. Because it is possible for the Devil in the Shape

of an innocent Person to do other mischiefs.
As for those

who acknowledge that Satan may personate a pious Person,
but not to do mischief, their Opinion has been confuted by
more than a few unhappy Instances.
Mr. Clark1 speaks of

a Man that had been an Atheist, or a Sadduce, not believ-

ing that there are any Devils or any (to us) invisible World ;

this Man was converted, but as a Punishment for his Infi-

delity, evil Angels did often appear to him in the Shape of

his most intimate
Friends, and would sometimes seduce

him into great Inconveniences.
It has been elsewhere, and

but now noted, that a Daemon in the shape of excellent Mr.

Dury appeared to the Turkish Chaos, Anno 1658. to dis-

gwade him from prosecuting his desires of Baptism into the
Name of Christ
: Also to Mr. Earle in the likeness of his

Friends, to discourage him from doing things lawful and

good.
A multitude of Jews were once deluded by a Per-

son pretending to be Moses from Heaven, and that if they
would follow him they should pass safe through the Sea

235

(as did their Fathers of old through the Red Sea) whereby

great numbers of them were deceived and perished in the

Waters.
1Learned and judicious Men have concluded that

this Moses Creensis was nDcemon, transforming himself into

Moses :
And that the Devil has frequently appeared

2 in

the shape of famous Persons to the end that he might seduce
Men into Idolatry, (a Sin equal to that of Witchcraft) no
Man that has made it his Concern to enquire into things of

this nature can be ignorant.
Many examples of this kind

are collected by Mr. Bromhall in his Treatise of Spectres,
and the cunning Devil, to strengthen Men in their worship-

ping of Saints departed: And by Mr. Bovet in his Pande-

monium.
It is credibly reported that the Devil in the like-

ness of a faithful Minister (as St. Ives before mentioned,
near Boston
in Lincolnshire) came
to one that was
in

trouble of Mind, telling her the longer she lived, the worse

it would be for her ; and
therefore advising her to
Self-

murder
: An Eminent person still living had the account of

this matter from Mr. Cotton (the famous Teacher of both

Bostons.) He was well
acquainted with
that
Minister,

who related to him the whole Story, with all the Circum-

stances of
it
:
For Mr.
Gotten was so affected with the

Report, as
to take a Journey on purpose
to the Town

where this happened, that so he might obtain a satisfactory
account about it, which he did.
Some Authors say, that a

Daemon
appeared
hi
the form
of Sylvanus (Hierom's

Friend) attempting a dishonest thing, the Devil thereby

designing to blast the Reputation of a famous Bishop.

have in another Book mentioned that celebrated Instance

concerning an honest Citizen in Zurich (the Metropolis of

Helvetia} in whose shape the Devil appeared, committing
an abominable Fact (not fit to be named) very early in the

Morning, seen by the Prefect of the City, and his Servant
;

they were amazed to behold a Man of good Esteem for his

Conversation, perpetrating a thing so vile and abominable ;
but going from the Spectre in the Field, to the Citizen's

House in the Town, they found him at home, and in his

Bed, nor had he been abroad
that Morning, which con-

vinced them, that what they saw was an Illusion of the

Devil
:
This passage is mentioned as a thing known and

certain by Lavater in his Treatise of Spectres,

1 who was a

most learned and judicious Preacher in that City.
Our

Juel saith of him, that he must ingeniously confess, that he

never understood Solomon's Proverbs
until Lavater
ex-

pounded them to him
: That Book of his De Spectris hath

been published
in Latin, High and Low Dutch, French,

Italian.
The learned Zanchy* speaks highly of
it, pro-

fessing that he had read it both with Pleasure and Profit.

Voetius*
takes
notice
of that
passage which we
have

quoted out of Lavater as a thing memorable.

Some Popish Authors
argue, That the Devil
cannot

personate an innocent Man as doing an act of Witchcraft,
because then he might as well represent them as commit-

ting Theft, Murder, &c.
And
if
so,
there would be no

living
in
the World
: But I turn the Argument against

them, he may (as the mentioned Instances prove) personate

237

honest Men as doing other Evils ; and no solid Reason can

be given why he may not as well personate them under the

Notion of Witches, as under the Notion of Thieves, Mur-

derers, and Idolaters : As for the Objection, that then there

would be no living in the World, we shall consider it under

the next Argument.

Arg. 3. If Satan may not represent one that is not a

Covenant
Servant
of
his,
as
afflicting
those
that are

bewitched or possessed, then it is either because he wants

Will, or Power to do this, or because God will never per-
mit him thus to do.
No man but a Sadduce doubts of the

ill will of Devils
; nothing is more pleasing to the Malice

of those wicked Spirits than to see Innocency wronged
:

And the Power of the Enemy is such, as that having once

obtained a Divine
Concession
to use
his Art, he can do

this and much more than this amounts unto
: We know by

Scripture-Revelation, that the Sorcerers of Egypt caused

many untrue and delusive Representations before Pharaoh

and his Servants.

His Heart is beyond what

the wisest of Men may pretend unto
: He has perfect skill

in Opticks, and can therefore cause that to be invisible to one,
which is not so to another, and things
also to appear far

otherwise then they are
: He has likewise the Art of Lim-

ning in the Perfection of it, and knows what may be done

by Colours.
It
is an odd passage

2 which
I find in the

2 Acta Eruditorum, Anno 1690. Pag. 113.

238
CASES OF CONSCIENCE

A eta Eruditorum, printed by Lipsick, that about Thirty-
two Years ago an indigent Merchant
in France was
in-

structed by a Dcemon, that with Water of Borax he might
colour Taffities, so as to cause them to glister and look very

gay
:
He searcheth into the Nature, Causes, and Reasons

of things, whereby he is able to produce wonderful effects.
So that if he does not form the Shape of an innocent Per-

son as afflicting others, it is not from want of either will or

power.
They that affirm, that God never
did, nor ever

will permit him thus to do, alledge that it is inconsistent

with the Righteousness and Providence of God, in govern-

ing Humane Affairs thus to suffer Men to be imposed on :

It must be acknowledged

1 that the Divine Providence has

taken care, that the greatest part of Mankind shall not be

left to unavoidable Deception, so as to be always abused by

the mischievous Agents of Hell, in the Objects
of plain

Sence : But yet it is not for sinful and silly Mortals to pre-

scribe Rules to the most High in his Government of the

World, or to direct him how far he may permit Satan to

use
his power
:
I am apt
to think that there
are some

amongst us, who if they had lived in JoUs days, and seen

the Devil tormenting of him, and heard him complaining

of being scared with Dreams, and
terrified with
Night-

visions, they would have joined with his uncharitable Friends

in censuring him as a most guilty Person
: But we should

consider, that the most high God doth sometimes deal with
Men in a way of absolute Sovereignty, performing the thing
which is appointed for them, and many such things are with

him
:
If he does destroy the perfect with the wicked, and

laugh at the tryal of the innocent, (Job 9. 22, 23).
Who

shall enter into his Councils
! who has given him a Charge

over the Earth
! orwho has disposed the whole World ! Men

are not able to give an account of his ordinary Works, much

less of his secret Counsels, and the dark Dispensations of his

Providence
: They do but darken Counsel by Words with-

out Knowledge when they undertake it
:
If we are not able

to see how this or that can stand with the Righteousness

of him that governs the World,
shall we
say that the

Almighty will pervert Judgment ?
or that he that governs

the Earth hateth Right 1
Shall we condemn him that is

most jvist 1 But whereas 'tis objected ; where is Providence 1
And how shall men live on the Earth, if the Devil may be

permitted to use such Power ?
I demand, where was Provi-

dence, when Satan had Power to cause Sons of Belial to

lye and swear away the Life of innocent Naboth, layig
such Crimes to his charge as he was never guilty of? And
what an Hour of Darkness was
it?
How
far was the

Power of Hell permitted to prevail, when Christ the Son of
God was accused, condemned, and hanged
for a Crime

that he
never was
guilty
of?
That was
the strangest

Providence that has happened since the World began, and

yet
in the
Issue the most glorious
: We must therefore

distinguish between what does ordinarily come to pass by

the Providence of God, and things which are extraordinary
:

It is not an usual thing for a Naboth to have his Life taken

from him by false Accusations, or for an Atfianasius or a
Susanna to be charged, and perhaps brought before Courts

of Judicature
for Crimes of which they were altogether

innocent.

240
CASES OF CONSCIENCE

But if we therefore conclude, that such a thing as this

can never happen in the World, we shall offend against the

Generation of the Just
: It is not ordinary for Devils to be

permitted to reveal the
secret
Sins of Men
: yet this has

been done more than once or twice
: Nor is it ordinary for

Daemons to steal Money out of Mens Pockets, and Purses,

or Wine and Cyder out of their Cellars.
Yet some such

Instances have there been amongst our selves.
It is not

usual for Providence to permit the Devil to come from Hell

and to throw Fire on the tops of Houses, and to
cause a

whole Town to be burnt to Ashes thereby; there would (it
must be confessed) be no living in the World, if evil Angels

should be permitted to do thus when they had a mind to it ;

nevertheless, Authors worthy of Credit,
tell us, that this

has sometimes happened.
Both Erasmus1 and Cardanas

write that the Town of Schiltach in Germany, was in the
Month of April, 1533. set on fire by a Devil, and burnt to

the
ground
in
an
hour's
space:
'Tis
also
reported by

Sigibert, Aventinus and
others, that some Cottages and

Barns in a Town
called Bingus were
fired by a wicked

Genius ; that spiteful Daemon said it was for the Impieties

of such a Man whom he named, that he was sent to molest

purpose,
in
the
account
of the Bitcuneers
of America,

wherein my Author relates that a Servant, who was Spirited
or Kidnapt (as they call it) into America, falling into the
Hands of a Tyrannical Master, he ran away from him, but

being taken and brought back, the hard-hearted Tyrant

lashed him on his naked Back, until his Body ran in an

entire stream of Blood ; to make the Torment of this miser-

able
Creature
intolerable, he anointed
his wounds with

Juice
of Lemon mingled with
Salt
and
Pepper,
being

ground
small
together, with which torture the miserable

Wretch gave up the Ghost, with these
dying Words, /

beseech the Almighty God, Creator of Heaven and Earth,

that he permit a wicked Spirit, to make tJiee feel as many
Torments before thy Death, as thou hast caused me to feel

before mine : Scarce four days were past after this horrible

Fact, when
the Almighty Judge gave permission to the

Father of Wickedness to possess the Body of
that
cruel

Master, and to make him lacerate his own Flesh until he

died, belike surrendring his Ghost into the Hands of the

infernal Spirit, who had tormented his Body
: But of this

Tragical Story enough.

To proceed, Is it not usual for Persons after their Death

to appear unto
the Living; But
it
does not
therefore

follow, that the great God will not suffer this to be
: For

both in former and latter Ages, Examples thereof have not

been wanting
: No longer since than the last Winter, there

\ras much discourse in London concerning a Gentlewoman,
unto whom her dead Son (and another whom she knew not)

:
Being then
in London,
I was Willing to

satisfie my self, by enquiring into the Truth of what was

reported ; and on Febr. 23. 1691. my Brother (who is now

a Pastor to a Congregation in that City) and I discoursed

the Gentlewoman spoken of;
she
told
us, that a Son of

hers, who had been a very civil young Man, but more airy

in his Temper than was pleasing to his
serious Mother,

being dead, she was much concerned nrher Thoughts about

his Condition in the other World ; but a Fortnight after

his Death he appeared
to
her,
saying, Mother, you are

solicitous about my Spiritual Welfare ;
trouble your self

no more, for I am happy, and so vanished
; should there

be a continual Intercourse between the Visible and Invisi-

ble World, it would breed Confusion.
But from thence to

infer, that the great Ruler of the Universe will never per-
mit any thing
of
this nature to

is an inconsequent

Conclusion
it
is not usual for Devils to be permitted to

come and violently carry away persons through the Air,

several miles from their Habitations

Nevertheless, this

was done in Sweedland about twenty Years ago, by means

of a cursed Knot of Witches there.

4. It is certain both from Scripture and History,

that Magicians by their Incbantments and Hellish conju-

rations, may cause a false Representation of Persons and

Things. An inchanted eye shall see such things as others

cannot discern
; it is a thing too well known to be denied,

that some by rubbing their eyes with a bewitched Water,
have immediately thereupon seen that which others could

not discern ; and there are Persons in the World, who have

a strange Spectral sight.
Mr. Glanvil 1 speaks of a Dutch-

man that could see Ghosts which
others could perceive

nothing of.
There are in Spain a sort of men whom they

such things, except they be the effects of some old Inchant

ment, I know not; nor what Natural Reason to assign for

that which I find amongst the Observations of the Imperial
Academy for the Year 1687, viz. That in an Orchard where

are choice Damascen Plumbs, the Master of the Family

being sick of a Quartan Ague, whilst he continued very ill,

four of
his Plumb-trees
instead
of Damascens brought

forth a vile sort of yellow Plumbs
: but recovering Health,

the next Year the Tree did (as formerly) bear Damascens

again
; but when after that he fell into a fatal Dropsie, on

those Trees were seen not Damascens, but another sort of

Fruit.
The same Author1 gives Instances of which he had

the certain knowledge,
concerning Apple-trees and Pear-

trees, that the Fruit of them would on a sudden wither as

if they had been baked
in an Oven, when the owners of

them were mortally sick.

As for Mr. Sinclare's Notion that some

Persons may have a second Sight, (as 'tis termed) and yet

be
themselves Innocent,
I am satisfied
that he judgeth

right ;
for this
is common amongst the Laplanders, who

are
horribly
addicted
to
Magical
Incantations
:
They

bequeath their Daemons to their Children as a Legacy, by
whom they are often assisted
(like Bewitched Persons as

they are) to see and do things beyond the Power of Nature.
An Historian who deserves Credit, relates,

1 that a certain

Laplander gave him a true and particular Account of what

had happened to him in
his Journey to Lapland;
and

further complained to him with Tears, that things at great

distance were represented to him, and how much he desired

to be Delivered from that Diabolical Sight, but could not ;

this doubtless was caused by some Inchantment.
But to

proceed to what I intend
;
the Eyes of Persons by reason

of Inchanting Charms, may not only see what others do not,
but be under such power of Fascination,
as
that
things

which are not, shall appear to them as real
: The Apostle

speaks of Bewitched Eyes, Gal.

1. and we know from

Scripture, that the Imaginations of men have by Inchant-

ments been imposed upon ;
and Histories abound with very

strange Instances of this Nature
: The old Witch Circe by

an Inchanted Cup caused Ulysses his Companions to ima-

gine themselves to be turned into Swine
;
and how many

Witches have been themselves so bewitched by the Devil,

as really to believe that they were transformed into Wolves,

or Dogs, or Cats.
It is reported ofSimon Magu,

1 that by

his Sorceries he would so impose on the Imaginations of

People, as that they thought he had really changed himself

into another sort of Creature.
Opollonius of Tyana could

out do Simon with his Magick
: The great Bohemian Con-

jurer Zyto* by his Inchantments, caused
certain Persons

whom he had a mind to try his Art upon, to image that

their Hands were turned into the Feet of an Ox, or into

the Hoofs of a Horse, so that they could not reach to the

Dishes
before them to take any thing
thence
;
he sold

Wisps of Straw to a Butcher who bought them for Swine
;

that many such
prestigious Pranks were played, by the

unhappy Faustm,
is
attested by Camerarius, Wyerus,

Voetius, Lavater, and Lonicer.

There is newly Published a Book (mentioned in the Acta

Eritditorwni) wherein the Author 3

( JViechard Valvassor)

relates, that a Venetian Jew instructed him (only he would

not attend his Instructions) how to make a Magical Glass

which should represent any Person or thing according
as

he should desire.
If a Magician by an Inchanted Glass

can do this, he may as well by the help of a Daemon cause

false Idceas of Persons and Things to be impressed on the

Imaginations of bewitched Persons ; the Blood and Spirits

of a Man, that is bitten with a Mad-Dog, are so envenomed,

as that strange Impressions are thereby made on his Ima-

gination

Looking-Glass, and he
will
(if put upon it) not only say

that he

is no

Dog it may be within 20 Miles of him;
and is it not then

possible for the Dogs of Hell to poyson the Imaginations of

miserable Creatures, so as that they shall believe and swear

that such Persons hurt them as never did so?
I have heard

of an Inchanted Pin, that has caused the Condemnation

and Death of many scores of innocent Persons.
There was

a notorious Witchfinder in Scotland, that undertook by a

Pin, to make an infallible Discovery of suspected Persons,
whether they were Witches or not, if when the Pin was

run an Inch or two into the Body of the accused Party no

Blood appeared, nor any sense of Pain,
then he declared

them
to be Witches
;
by means hereof my Author
tells

me no less then 300 persons were Condemned for Witches

in that Kingdom.
This Bloody Jugler after he had done

enough in Scotland, came to the Town of Berwick upon
Tweed ; an honest Man now living in New-England as-

sureth me, that he saw the Man thrust a great Brass Pin

two Inches into the Body of one, that some would in that

way try whether there was Witchcraft in the Case or no
:

the accused Party was not in the least sensible of what was

done, and therefore in danger of receiving the Punishment

justly due for Witchcraft; only it so happened, that Collonel

Fenwick (that worthy Gentleman, who many years since

lived in New-England) was then the Military Governour

in that Town ; he sent for the Mayor and Magistrates ad-

vising them to be careful and cautious in their proceedings ;

for he told them, it might be an Inchanted Pin, which the

Witchfinder made use of:
Whereupon the Magistrates of

249

the place ordered that he should make his Experiment with

some other Pin as they should appoint :
But that he would

by no means be induced unto, which was a sufficient Dis-

covery of the Knavery and Witchery of the Witchfmder.

There is a strange Diabolical Energy goeth along with In-

cantations.
If Balak had not known that he would not

have sent for Balaam, to see whether he could inchant the

Children of Israel.
The Scripture intimates that Incbant-

ments will keep a Serpent from biting, Eccles. 10. 11.
A

Witch in Sweedland confessed, that the Devil gave her a

wooden Knife ;
and that if she did but touch any living

thing with that Knife, it would die immediately
: And that

there is a wonderful Power of the Devil attending things

inchanted, we have confirmed by a prodigious Instance in

Major Weir, a Scotch Man
:
That wretched Man was a

perfect Prodigy; a Man of great Parts ; esteemed a Saint,

yet lived in secret Uncleanness with his own Sister for thirty

four Years together

: After his wickedness was discovered,

he did not seem to be troubled at any of his Crimes, except-

ing
that he had caused a poor Woman to be publickly

whipped, because she reported that she had seen him com-

mitting Bestiality; which thing was true, only the Woman

could not prove it.
This horrid Creature, if he had his In-

chanted Staff in his Hand could pray to admiration, and do

extraordinary things, as is more amply related in the Post-

script to Mr. Sinclares his Book before mentioned
:
But

if he had not his Inchanted Rod to lean upon, he could not

transform himself into an Angel of Light

: But by all these

things we may conclude, that it is not impossible, but that

a guilty Conjurer, that so he may render himself the less

suspected, may by his Magical Art and Inchantment, cause

innocent Persons to be represented as afflicting those whom

the Devil and himself are the Tormentors of.

Arg.

The Truth we affirm
is
so
evident,
as
that

many Learned and Judicious Men have freely subscribed

unto
it.

The memorable
Relation of the Devils assuming the

shape of an innocent Citizen in Zurich, is in the Judgment

of that great Divine Lud Lavater, of weighty Considera-

tion
: And he declares, that he does therefore mention
it,

that so Judges might be cautelous in their Proceedings in

Cases of this nature, inasmuch as the Devil does often in

that way intangle innocent Persons, and bring them into

great Troubles.
His Words
are,

lHanc Historiam idea

recito, ut Judices, in hujusmodi, Casibus cauti sint: Did-

bolus enim hoc via scepe innocentibus insidiatur.
He con-

firms what he
saith by reciting a Passage out of Alertus

Granzius, who writes that the Devil was seen in the shape

of a Nobleman
to come out of the Empress's Chamber
:

But to clear her Innocency, she (according to the super-

stitious Ordeals then in fashion) walked blindfold over a

great many of glowing hot Irons without touching any of

them.
Voetius in his 2Disputation of Spectres proposeth

that Question, whether the Devil may not untruly personate
a Godly Man, and answers in the Affirmative
: And withal

adds, that it is sufficient Argument (ad hominem) to answer

the Papists with their own Histories, which give Instances

251

of Satan's appearing in the Figure of Saints, nay of Christ

himself.
And in his Discourse concerning the Operations

of Daemons1 he has the like Problem, whether the Devil

may not possibly put on the shape of a true Believer, a real

Saint, not only of such as are dead, but
still
living, and

answers, Quidni ? Why not ?
It is true Popish Casuists*

do
generally
incline
to
the Negative
in
this Question
:

Nevertheless, the Instance of Germanus, who saw a Com-

pany of honest People represented by the Devil, as if they
had been feasting together, when they were really asleep

in their Beds, does a little puzzle them, so as that they are

necessitated to take up with this Conclusion, *That by an

extraordinary Permission of God, innocent Persons may

be represented by Satan in the Nocturnal Conventicles of
Witches : And if
so, much more as
afflicting bewitched

Persons.
Delrio giveth an account of an innocent Monk,

whose Reputation was indangered by a Daemon's appearing

in his shape.
He writes more like a Divine than Jesuits

use to do, when he saith that,

4It is not absolutely to be

denied, but that the Devils may exhibite the Forms ofinno-

cent Persons, if Godpermit it, who when he does permit it,

usually by some Providence discovers
the Fraud of the

Devils, that so the Innocent may be vindicated, or if not,

it is to bring thtm to repentance for some Sin, or to try

their Patience.

cannot call to mind one of any Note, that does deny the

Possibility
of the
affirmative, in the Question before us.

Dr. Henkelius has lately published a learned and elabor-

ate Discourse concerning the right Method of curing such

as are obsessed with Cacodcemons, in which he asserts, that

Satan may possibly assume the Form of innocent andpious

Persons, that so he might thereby'destroy'their Reputations^
and expose them to undue Punishments. As for OUT English

Divines, there
are not many greater
Casuists than Mr.

Perkins ; nor do I know any one that has written on the

Case of Witchcraft with more Judgment and Clearness of

Understanding: He has
these Words,

2 "If a Man being

dangerously sick and like to die upon suspicion, will take

" it on his death, that such an one has bewitched him, it is
" an allegation which may move the Judge to examine the
"

Party, but it is of no moment for Conviction." The like

is asserted by

3Mr. Cooper, Mr. Bernard, (once a famous

Minister at Batcomb in Somerset) his Book called A Guide

to Grand Jury-men in Cases of Witchcraft, is a solid and

wise Treatise.
What his Judgment was in the Case now

under debate, we may see, pay. 209, 210. where his Words

are these ;

" An Apparition of the Party suspected, whom

" the Afflicted in their Fits seem to see, is a great suspicion ;

"yet this is but a presumption, tho' a strong one, because

"these Apparitions
are wrought by the Devil, who can

"

represent to the Phansie such as the Parties use to fear,

" in which his representation he may well lye as in his other

" Witness
: For if the Devil can represent to the Witch

" a seeming Samuel, saying,
I see Gods ascending out of

" the Earth, to beguile Saul, may we not think he can re-

present a common ordinary Person, Man or Woman un-
"

regenerate, tho' no Witch to the Phansie of vain Persons,

" to deceive them and others that will give Credit to the

"Devil."
Thus Mr. Bernard.

As for .the Judgment of the Elders in New-England, so

far as I can learn, they do generally concur with Mr. Per-

kins, and Mr. Bernard.
This I know, that at a Meeting

of Ministers at Cambridge, August
1. 1692. where were

present seven elders besides the President of the Colledge,

the Question then discoursed
on, was, Whether the Devil

may not sometimes have aPermission to represent an inno-

cent Person as tormenting such as are under Diabolical

Molestations?
The Answer which they all concurred in,

was
in
these words,
viz., That the Devil may sometimes

have a Permission to represent an innocent Person as tor-

menting such as are under Diabolical Molestations ;
liit

that such things are rare and extraordinary, especially
when such Matters come before Civil Judicatures: Arid

that some of the most eminent Ministers in the Land, who

were not at that Meeting are of the same Judgment, I am

assured
: And I am also sure, that in Cases of this nature

the Priest's Lips should keep Knoivledge, and they should

seek the Laiv at his Mouth, Mai.
2.
7.

Arg. 6. Our own Experience has confirmed the Truth of

what ive affirm.

I have
in another Book given an account concerning

254
CASES OF CONSCIENCE

Elizabeth Knap of Groton, who complained that a Woman

as eminent for Piety as any in that Town, did appear to

her, and afflict her
: But afterwards she was satisfied that

that Person never did her any harm, but that the Devil

abused them both.
About two Years ago, a bewitched

Person in Chelmsford in her Fits, complained that a worthy

good Man, a near Relation of hers did afflict her
: So did

she likewise complain of another Person
in that town of

known integrity and Piety.

I have my self known several of whom I ought to think

that they are now in Heaves, considering that they were

of good Conversation, and reputed Pious by those that had

the greatest Intimacy with them, of whom nevertheless,
some complained that their Shapes appeared to them, and

threatned them
:
Nor
is this answered by saying, we do

not know but those Persons might be Witches
: We are

bound by the Rule of Charity to think otherwise
: And

they that censure any, meerly because such a sad Affliction

as their being,falsly represented by Satan has befallen them,
do not do as -they would be done by.
I bless the Lord, it

was never the portion allotted to me, nor to any Relation

of mine to be thus abused : But no Man knoweth what may

happen to him, since there be just Men unto whom it hap-

peneth according to
the Work of the
Wicked, Eccles.
8.

1 4.
But what needs more to be said, since there is one

amongst our selves whom no Man
that knows him, can

think him
to be a Wizzard, whom yet some bewitched

Persons complained
of, that they are
in
his Shape
tor-

mented
: And the Devils have of late accused some eminent

Persons.

CONCERNING WITCHCRAFTS.
255

It is an awful thing which the Lord has done to convince

8ouie amongst us of their Error
: This then I declare and

testifie, that to take away the Life of any one, meerly be-

cause a Spectre or Devil, in a bewitched or possessed Person

does accuse them, will bring the Guilt of innocent Blood

on the Land, where such a thing
shall be done
: Mercy

forbid that it should, (and I trust that as it has not it never

will be so) in New-England. What does such an Evidence

amount unto more than this
: Either such an one did afflict

such an one, or the Devil in his likeness, or his Eyea were

bewitched.

The things which have been mentioned make way
for,

and bring us unto the second Case, which is to come under

our Consideration,
viz.

If one bewitched is struck down at the Look or cast of

the Eye of another, and after that recovered again by a

Touchfrom the same Person, Isnot this aninfallible Proof,

that the Person suspected and complained of is in League
with the Devil ?

Answer ; It must be owned that by such things as these

Witchcrafts and Witches have been discovered more than

once or twice
: And
that an
ill Fame, or other Circum-

stances attending the suspected Party, this may be a Ground

for Examination
; but this alone does not afford sufficient

Matter
for
Conviction
: As Spectres or Devils appearing

in the shapes of Men that have been murdered, declaring
that
they were murdered by such Persons and in such a

place, may give just occasion to the Magistrate for Enquiry

into
the
Matter

any Man.
If my Reader
pleaseth,
he
shall hear what

old Mr. Bernard ofBatcomb saith to a Case not unlike to

this, and the former: His Words are these,

1 'The naming

* of the suspected
in their Fits, and also where they have

'

been, and what they have done
here
or
there, as Mr.

' Throgmorton's Children could do, and that often and ever

' found true ;
this is a great Presumption
:- yet is this but

* a Presumption, because this is only the Devils Testimony,
'who
can
lie, and that more
often
than speak Truth.

' Christ would not allow his Witness
of him
in
a point

' most true
; nor St. Paul in the due Praises of him and

' Sylas;
his Witness then may not be received as sufficient

f in case of ones Life
: He may accuse an
Innocent, as
I

' shewed before in Mr. Edmund's giving over his Practice

' to find Stollen Goods ; and Satan we read would accuse

' Job to God himself to be an Hypocrite, and to be ready

4 to be a Blasphemer, and he is called the Accuser of the

' Brethren.
Albeit, I cannot deny but this has very often

* proved true, yet seeing the Devil
is such an one as you

'

heard, Christian Men should not take his Witness, to give

' in Verdict upon Oath, and so swear that the Devil has

* therein spoken the Truth
; be
it
far from good men
to

f confirm any Word of the Devil by Oath,
if
it be not an

ing the Truth, has a lying Intent, and speaks some Truths

pernicious Lye, which cannot be

* ensnare the Blood of the Innocent.'
Thus Mr. Bernard

resolved the Case above sixty Years ago
; and truly in my

Opinion like a Wise and Orthodox Divine, what he says,

reacheth both this and the former
Case.
Dr.
Gotta
(a

Learned
Physician)
in
his
Book, about The Tryal of

Witchcraft, shewing the true and right Method of the Dis-

covery , with a Confutation of Erroneous ways (which Book

he dedicates to the Right Honourable Sir Edwqrd Cook,
Lord Chief Justice of England,)

1 He discourses concerning

Exploration of Witches by the touch of the Witch curing

the touched bewitched, and sheweth the
Fallibility and

Vanity of that way of Tryal, tho' he had often seen Per-

sons bewitched in that way immediately delivered from the

present Fit or Agony which was upon them : But he taketh

it to be a Diabolical Miracle.
He argueth thus,

' No Man

*

indued, is supernatural

:
If
it be
so, How can man
to

is simply possible
that is not natural be

'justly reputed
an Agent
therein ?
If
he
cannot
be

4 esteemed in himself any possible or true Agent, then it

1 remaineth that he can only be interested therein as an

1 Accessary in Consent, or as a Servant unto a Superior

:
If that
Superior Power be the Devil, the least

alone, or with the

* any Man incline rather to credit the Devil's mouth in the

' Bewitched, than
to

If the Devil by

sons, how is it reasonable and just that the Impositions of

1 the Devil should be imputed unto any Man
: And (saith

'

he) God forbid that the Devil's Signs and Wonders, nay

* his Truths, should become any legal Allegations or Evi-

1 dences in Law.
We may therefore conclude
it unjust,

' that theforenamed miraculous Effect by the Devil wrought

' and imputed by the Bewitched, should be esteemed an in-

* fallible mark against any Man, as therefore convinced for

* that the Devil and the Bewitched have so decyphered him

'

Thus that Learned Man.
But to the Case in hand, I have

several things to offer.

1.
It
is possible that the Persons in Question may be

possessed with Cacodcemons : That bewitched Persons are

many times really possessed with evil Spirits,
is most cer-

tain.
And
as Mr. Perkins
observes, no Man can prove

but that Witchcraft might be the Cause of many of those

Possessions, which we read of in the Gospel
: And that

Devils have been immitted into the Bodies of miserable

Creatures by Magicians and Witches, Histories and Ex-

perience do abundantly testifie.
Ilierom1 relates concerning

a certain Virgin, that a young Man, whose Amours she

despised, prevailed with a Magician to send an evil Spirit

into
her, by means whereof she was
strangely besotted.

Tis reported

1 of Simon Magus, that after he had used an

Hellish
Sacrifice, to be revenged of some that had called

him a great Witch, he caused infernal Spirits to enter into

them.
Many confessing Witches have acknowledged, that

they were the Cause
of
such
and
such Persons being

possessed of evil Angels, as -Thyrceus and others have ob-

served
: Now no Credit ought to be given to what Dcemons

in such as are by them obsessed shall say.
Our Saviour by

his own unerring Example has taught us not to receive the

Devil's Testimony in any thing.
The Papists
are justly

condemned
for bringing Diabolical Testimony to confirm

the Principles of their Religion.
Peter Cotton the Jesuite3

enquired of the Devil in a possessed Person, what was the

clearest Scripture to prove Purgatory.
At the time when

Luther died, all the possessed People in the Netherlands

were quiet
: The Devils in them said, the Reason was, be-

cause Luther* had been a great Friend of theirs, and they
owed him that respect as to go as f:,r as Germany to attend

his Funeral.
Another time when there was a talk of some

Ministers of the Reformed Religion, the Devils in the Ob-

sessed laughed and said, they were not at all afraid of them,

for the Calvinists and they were very good Friends.
The

Jesuits insult with these Testimonies as if they were Divine

Oracles
: But the Father of Lyes is never to be believed

He will utter twenty great truths to make way for one lye
:

He will accuse twenty Witches, if he can but thereby bring
one innocent Person into trouble

Lyes, that so those truths giving credit unto lyes, Men may

believe both, and so be deceived
: And whereas some say,

that the Persons
in question are only bewitched and not

possessed, let
it be considered that possessed Persons are

called Energumens from EPFOMAI Agitor :
They whose

Bodies are preternaturally agitated, so as to be in danger of

being thrown into the Fire, or into the Water, though they
may be bewitched, are undoubtedly possessed with Daemons,
Mark 9. 22, 25.
Learned Men1 give it as a most certain

sign of Possession, when the
afflicted Party can see and

hear that which no one else can discern any thing of, and
when they can discover
2seeret things, Acts,
6. 16. past,

or
future,

3as a
possessed
Person
in Germany
foretold

the War which broke out in the Year 1546.
And when

the Limbs of miserable Creatures, are bent and disjointed

so as could not possible be without a Luxation of
Joints,

were
it not done by a preternatural Hand, and yet no hurt

raised thereby that argueth Possession.
Also when Per-

sons are by the Devil cast into Fits, in the which they speak

of things, that afterwards they have no remembrance of,

or,
if they are by
cruel Devils
tortured, so
as
to
cause

horrendous
Clamours
in the
distressed
Sufferers,
that's

another sign of Obsession by evil Spirits

:
If all these things

concur in the Persons concerning where the Question
is,

we may conclude them to be Dcemoniacks : and if
so, no

Juror can with a safe Conscience look on the Testimony of

such, as sufficient to take away the Life of any Man.

a natural, but an arbitrary Cause ? not from any Poyson

in the Eye
of the Witch, but from
the Agency of some

Dcemon : The
opinion
of Fascination by the Eye
is an

old Fable, and (saith Mr. Perkins) as fond as old.
Pliny

speaks of a People that
killed
folks by looking on them ;

and he adds, that they had two Apples in each eye
: and

Tully writes of women who had two Apples in one Eye

that always did mischief with their meer looks
; So Ovid,

Pupula duplexfulminat. And Plutarch? writes that some

persons have
such a Poyson
in their Eyes, as that their

Friends and
Familiars are
Fascinated thereby; nay
he

speaks of one
that Bewitched himself sick by looking on

his own Face in a Glass
: Others write of Fascination by

a meer Prolation of Words
;
and for ought I know, there

may be as much Witchery in the Tongue as there is in the

Eye.
Sennertus* has discovered the Superstition of these

Fancies ; Sight does not proceed from an Emission of Rays
from the Eye, but by a reception of the
visible
Species
;

and if it be (as Philosophers conclude) an innocent Action

and not an Emission of Optick Spirits, so that sight as such,
does receive something from the Object, and not act upon

it, the Notion of Fascination by the Eye is unphilosophical

:

It is true, that sore Eyes will affect those that look upon

them, Dum spectant
Oculi
Lcesos, Leduntur & ipsi, for

which a natural Reason is easily to be assigned
; but if the

Witches Eyes are thus infected with a natural Contagion,
Whence is it, that only Bewitched Persons are hurt thereby

?

CASES OF CONSCIENCE

the Look of his Poysonful Eye were a Truth, whatever

person that Serpent cast his Eye upon would be poysoned.
So if Witches had a physical Venom in their Eyes, others

as well as Fascinated Persons would be
sensible thereof;

there is as much Truth in this fancy of Physical Venom in

the Eye of a Witch, as there is in what Pliny

1 and others

relate concerning the Thibians,
viz. that they have two

Apples in one Eye, and the Effigies of an Horse in the other

Eye
; and that they are a people that cannot be drowned.

3. As for that which concerns the Bewitched Persons

being recovered out of their Agonies by the Touch of the

suspected Party,
it is various and fallible.

For sometimes the afflicted Person is made sick, (instead

of being made whole) by the Touch of the Accused ; some-

times the Power of Imagination is such, as that the Touch

of a Person innocent and not accused shall have the same

effect.
It is related in the Account of the Tryals of Witches

at Bury in Suffolk 1664, during the time2 of the Tryal,

there
were some Experiments made with
the Persons

afflicted, by bringing the accused
to touch them, and
it

was observed that by the least Touch of one of the supposed

Witches, they that were in their Fits, to all mens Appre-
hension wholly deprived of all Sense and Understandings,
would suddenly shriek out and open their Hands.

Mr. Serjeant Keeling did not think
that
sufficient
to

Convict the Prisoners, for admitting that the Children were

in truth Bewitched, yet (saith he)
it cannot be applyed to

the
Prisoners upon the Imagination

Parties

afflicted ;
for if that might be allowed, no Person whatso-

ever can be in safety, for perhaps they might fancy another

Person who might altogether be innocent in such matters :
To avoid this Scruple it was privately desired by the Judge,

that some Gentlemen there in Court would attend one of

the distempered Persons in the farther part of the Hall,

whilst she was in her Fits, and then to send for one of the

Witches to try what would happen, which they did accor-

dingly.
One
of them was conveyed from the
Bar, and

brought to the Afflicted Maid.
They put an Apron before

her Eyes, and then another person (not the Witch) touched

her, which produced the same effect, as the Touch of the

Witch did in the Court.
Whereupon the Gentlemen
re-

turned much
unsatisfied.
Bodin1 relates,
that a Witch

who was Tryed at Nants, was commanded by the Judges

to touch a Bewitched person, a thing
often practised by

the Judges of Germany in the Imperial Chamber.
The

Witch was extreamly unwilling, but being Compelled by

the Judges, she cryed out, / am undone ;
and as soon as

ever she touched the Afflicted person, the Witch fell down

dead, and the other recovered.
That
horrid Witch
of

Salisbury, Ann Bodenham2 who had been Servant to the

Notorious Conjurer Dr. Lamb, could not bear the sight of

one that was Bewitched by her.
As soon as ever she saw

the Afflicted Person, she ran about shrieking, and crying,
and roaring after an hideous manner, that the Devil would

tear her in pieces, if that person came near her.
And whilst

the Witch was in such Torment, the Bewitched was at ease.

CASES OF CONSCIENCE

By these things we see, that the Laws and Customs of the

Kingdom of darkness, are not always and in all places the

same.

And it is good for men to concern themselves with them

as little as may be.

I think there is weight in Dr. Cotta's1 Argument, viz.

Tfiat the Gift of healing the Sick and Possessed, was a

special Grace and Favour of God, for ike Confirmation

of the Truth of the Gospel, but that such a Gift should bt

annexed to the Touch of kicked Witches, as an infallible

sign of their guilt, is not easie to be believed.
It is a thing

well known, that if a person possessed by an Evil Spirit, is

(as
oft
it so happens) never so outragious whilst a good

man is Praying with and for the Afflicted, let him lay his

hand on them, and the Evil
Spirit
is quiet.
I hope this

is no evidence of any Covenant, or voluntary Communion

between the Good Man that is Praying and the Evil Spirit ;
no more does the Case before us evince any such thing.

4.
There are that Question the Lawfulness of the Ex-

periment.
For if this healing power in the Witch is not

a Divine but a Diabolical Gift,
it may be dangerous
to

meddle too much with
it.
If the Witch may be ordered to

touch afflicted Persons in order to their healing or recoveiy

out of a sick Fit, why may not the Deceased Person be as

well ordered to touch the Witch for the same cause ?
And

if to touch him, why not to scratch him and fetch Blood

out of him, which is but an harder kind of touch ?
But as

for this Mr. Perkins doubts not to call it a Practice of

Witchcraft.
It is not safe to meddle with any of the Devils

1 Ubi supra, p. 121.

CONCERNING WITCHCEAFTS.
265

Sacraments or Institutions; For my own part, I should be

loath
to say to a Man, that I knew or thought was d

Witch, do you look on such a Person, and see if you can

Witch them into a Fit, and there is such an afflicted Per-

son do you take them by the Hand, and see if you can

Witch them well again.
If it is by vertue of some Con-

tract with the Devil
that witches have Power to do such,

things, it is hard to conceive how they can be bid to do them,
without being too much concerned in that Hellish Covenant.

I take it to be
(as elsewhere1 I have
expressed) a solid

Principle,
which the Learned Sennertus
insists
on,
viz.

That they who force another to do that which he cannot

possibly do, but by vertue of a Compact with the Devil,
have themselves implicitely Communion with the Diabolical

Covenant.
The Devil is pleased and honoured when any

of his Institutions are made use of;
this way of discovering

Witches, is no better than that of putting the Urine of the

afflicted Person into a Bottle, that so the Witch may be

tormented and discovered
:
the Vanity and Superstition of

which practice I have formerly shewed, and testified against.
There was a Conjurer his name was Edward Drake2 wJw

taught a Man to use tfiat Experiment for the Relief of his

afflicted Daughter, who found
benefit
thereby ; But we

ought not to practice Witchcraft to discover Witches, nor

may we make use of a White healing Witch (as they call

them) to find out a Black and Bloody one.
And how did

men first come to know that Witches would be discovered

in such ways as these, which have been mentioned 1
If

Satan himself were the first Discoverer (as there is reason

to believe) the experiment must needs have
deceit in
it.

And such Experi-

ments better become Pagans or Papists than Professors in

New-England ; whereas 'tis pleaded, that such things are

practised by the Judges of the Imperial Chamber, I reply,

that those Judges (As Bodin relates, Lib. 3, Daemon. Cap.

6.) have required suspected Witches to pronounce over the

afflicted persons, these words, / bless thee in the Name of

the Father, &c. upon which
they have immediately reco-

vered;
but
is the dark
day come upon
us,
that such

Superstitions as these shall be practised in New-England:

Jesus
forbid
it.

5. If the Testimony of a beivitched or possessed Person,

is of validity as to what they see done to themselves, then

it is so as to others, whom they
see
afflicted no less than

themselves : But what they affirm concerning others, is not

to be taken for Evidence.
Whence had they this Super-

natural
Sight ?
It must needs be either from Heaven or

from
Hell
:
If from Heaven, (as
Elisha's
Servant, and

Balaam's Ass could discern Angels) let their Testimony be

received
: But if they had this Knowledge from Hell, tho'

there may possibly be truth in what they affirm, they are

not legal Witnesses
: For the Law
of God
allows of no

Revelation from any other Spirit but himself, Isa.

so as to be an Evidence

of Conviction
:
The

Persons,
concerning whom
the Question
is,
see things

through Diabolical Mediums ; on which account their Evi-

dence is not meer humane Testimony; and if it be in any

part Diabolical,
it is not to be owned as Authentick ;
for

the Devil's Testimony ought not to be received neither in

whole nor in part.
I arn told by credible Persons, who say

it is certainly true, that a bewitched Person has complained

that she was cast into Fits by the Look of a Dog; and that

she was no more able to bear the sight of that Dog, than

of the Person whom she accused as bewitching her
: And

that thereupon the Dog was shot to death
:
This Dog was

no Devil;
for then they could not have killed him.
I sup-

pose no one will say that Dogs are Witches
:
It remains

then
that the
casting down with a Look is no
infallible

sign of a Witch.

6.
It has always been said, that it is a difficult thing to

find
out Witches:
But
if the
Eepresentation
of such a

Person as afflicting, or the Look or Touch be an infallible

proof of the guilt of Witchcraft in the Persons complained

of,
'tis the easiest thing in the World
to
discover them
;

for it is done to our hand, and there needs no enquiry into

the Matter.

268
CASES OF CONSCIENCE

7.
Let them say this is an infallible Proof, produce any

Word out of the Law of God which does in the least coun-

tenance that Assertion: The Word of God instructs Jurors

and Judges to proceed upon clear humane Testimony, Deut.

35. 30.
But the Word no where giveth us the least In-

timation, that every one is a Witch, at whose look the be-

witched Person shall fall into Fits
; nor yet that any other

means should be used for the discovery of Witches, than

what may be used for the finding out of Murderers, Adul-

terers, and other Criminals.

8. Sometimes Antipathies in Nature have strange and

unaccountable Effects.
I have read of a Man that at the

sight of his own Son who was no Wizzard, would fall into

Fits.
There are that find in their Natures an averseness

to some Persons whom they never saw before, of which they
can give no better an account than he in Martial, concern-

ing Sabidius.

Non Amo te Saltidi, nee possum dicere guare.

That some Persons at the Sight of Bruit-Creatures, Cats,

Spiders,
&c.
nay,
at the
sight
of Cheese, Milk, Apples,

will fall into Fits,
is too well known to be denied.
Pen-

singius in his Learned Discourse DePulvere Sympathetico,

p. 128. saith, there was one in the City of Groning that

could not bear the sight of a Swine's Head
: And that he

knew another who was not
able to look on the Picture

thereof.
Amatus Lusitanus speaks of one that at the sight

of a Rose would swoon away
: This proveth that the falling

into a Fit at the sight of another
is not always a sign of

269

Witchcraft.
It may proceed from Nature, and the Power

of Imagination.

To conclude ; Judicious Casuists^ have determined, that to

make use of those Media to come to the Knowledge of any

Matter, which have no such power in them by Nature, nor

by Divine Institution is an Implicit going to the Devil to
make a discovery
: Now there is no natural Power in the

Look or Touch of a Person to bewitch another ; nor is this

by Divine Institution the means whereby Witchcraft is dis-

covered
:
Therefore it is an unwarrantable Practice.

We proceed now to the third Case proposed to Considera-

tion
If the things which have been mentioned are not

infallible Proofs of Guilt in the accused Party,
it is then

Queried, Whether there are any Discoveries of this Crime,
which Jurors and Judges may with a safe Consciencepro-

ceed upon to the Conviction and Condemnation of the Per-

sons under Suspicion ?

Let me here premise Two things,

1. The Evidence in this Crime ought to be as clear as in

any other Crimes of a Capital nature.
The Word of God

does no where intimate, that a less clear Evidence, or that

fewer or other Witnesses may be taken as sufficient to con-

vict a Man of Sorcery, which would not be enough to convict
him were he charged with another evil worthy of Death,
Numb. 35. 30. if we may not take the Oath of a distracted

Person, or of a possessed Person in a Case of Murder, Theft,

Felony of any sort, then neither may we do it in the Case

of Witchcraft.

CASES OF CONSCIENCE

2. Let me premise this also, that there have been ways

of trying Witches
long used in many Nations, especially

in
the dark times of Paganism and Popery, which
the

righteous God never approved
of.
But which (as judicious

Mr. Perkins expresseth it in plain English) were invented

by the Devil, that so innocent Persons might be condemned,
and some
notorious Witches
escape
: Yea, many Super-

stitious and Magical experiments have been used to try
Witches by
: Of this sort is that of scratching the Witch,

or seething the Urine of the Bewitched Person, or making
a Witch-cake with that Urine
: And that tryal of putting

their hands into scalding Water, to see if it will not hurt
them
: And that of sticking an Awl under the Seat of the

suspected Party, yea, and that way of discovering Witches

by tying their Hands and Feet, and casting them on the

Water,
to
try whether they
will
sink or swim
:
I
did

publickly bear my Testimony against this superstition in a

Book printed at Boston eight Years past.

I hear that of
late some in a Neighbour
Colony have

been
playing with
this Diabolical invention
:
It is to be

lamented, that
in
such a Land of Uprightness
as New-

England once was, a Practice which
Protestant Writers

generally condemn as sinful, and which the more sober and

learned Men amongst Papists themselves have not
only

judged unlawful, but (to express it in their own terms) to

be no less than a Mortal Sin, should ever be heard of. Were

it not that the coming of Christ to judge the Earth draweth

near, I should think that
such Practices are an unhappy

Omen that the Devil and Pagans will get these dark Terri-

tories into their Possession again
But that I may not be

CONCERNING WITCHCRAFTS.
271

thought to have no reason for my calling the impleaded

Experiment into Question, I have these things further to

alledge against
it.

1.
It has been rejected long agone, by Christian Nations

as a thing Superstitious and Diabolical
: In Italy and Spain

ii
is wholly disused ; and
1in the Low-Countries, and in

France, where the Judges are Men of Learning.
In some

parts of Germany old Paganism Customs are observed more

than
in other Countries, nevertheless
all the 2Academies

throughout Germany have disapproved of this way of Pur-

gation.

2. The Devil is in
it, all Superstition is from him ; and

when
Secret
things, or latent
Crimes, are discovered by

superstitious
Practices, some
Compact and Communion

with the Devil is the Cause of it, as Austin* has truly inti-

mated ; and so it is here ; for if a Witch cannot be drowned,

this must proceed either from some natural Cause, which

it doth not, for
it
is
against Nature for Humane Bodies,

when Hands and Feet
are
tied, not
to
sink under the

Water
:
Besides, they that plead for this Superstition, say

that
if Witches happen to be condemned for some other

Crime and not for Witchcraft, they will not swim like a

Cork above Water, which Cause sheweth that the Cause of

this Natation is not Physical : Aud if not, then either
it

must proceed from a Divine Miracle to save a Witch from

drowning ;
or lastly, it must be a diabolical Wonder
: This

superstitious Experiment is commonly known by the Name

of, The Vulgar Probation, because it was never appointed

by any lawful Authority, but from the Suggestion of the

Devil taken up by the rude Rabble
: And some learned

Men
are
of Opinion, that
the
first Explorator (being a

white Witch) did explicitly covenant with the Devil, that

he should discover latent Crimes in this way

: And that it is

by Virtue of that first Contract that the Devil goeth to work

to keep his Servants from sinking, when this Ceremony of

his ordaining is used.
Moreover, we know that Diabolus

est Dei Simia, the Devil seeks to imitate Divine Miracles.
We read in Ecclesiastical Story, that some of the Martyrs
when they were by Persecutors ordered
to be drowned,

prov'd to be immersible
: This Miracle would the Devil

imitate in causing Witches, who are his Martyrs, not to sink
when they are cast into the Waters.

3. This way of Purgation is of the same nature with the

old Ordeals of the Pagans.
If Men were accused with any

Crime, to clear their innocency, they were to take an hot

Iron
into
their Hands, or to suffer
scalding Water to be

poured down
their Throats, and if they received no hurt

thereby they were acquitted.
This was the Devil's Inven-

tion, and many times (as the Devil would have it) they that

submitted to these Tryals suffered no inconvenience. Never-

theless, it is astonishing to think what innocent Blood has

been shed in the World by means of this Satanical device.

Witches have often (as ^Sprenger observes) desired that

they might stand or fall by this Tryal by hot Iron, and

sometimes come off well
: Indeed, this Ordeal was used in

other Cases, and not in Cases of Witchcraft only : And so

was
the
Vulgar Probation by
casting
into
the Water

practiced upon Persons accused1 with other Crimes as well

as that of Witchcraft
: How it came
to be restrained to

that of Witchcraft I cannot tell
;
it is as supernatural for a

Body whose Hands and Feet are tied
to swim above the

Water, as it is for their Hands not to feel a red hot Iron.

If the one of these Ordeals is lawful to be used, then so is

the other too
: But as for the fiery Ordeal it is rejected and

exploded out of the World
;
for the same reason then the

tryal by Water should be so.

4.
It is a tempting of God when Men put the Innocency

of their Fellow-Creatures upon such tryals
;
to desire the

Almighty to shew a Miracle to
clear the Innocent, or to

convict the Guilty is a most presumptuous tempting of him.
Was it not a Miracle when Peter was kept from sinking
under the Water by the Omnipotency of Christ ?
As for

Satan, we know that his Ambition is to make his Servants

believe that his Power is equal to God's, and that therefore

he can preserve whom he pleaseth.
I have read2 of certain

Magicians, who were seen walking on the Water
:
If then

guilty Persons shall float on the Waters, either it is the Devil

that causes them to do so, (as no doubt it is) and what have
Men to do to set the Devil on work ;
or else it is a Divine

Miracle,like that of Peter's not sinking, or that ofthe Iron that
swam at the Word of Elisha.
And shall Men try whether

God will work a Miracle to make a discovery 1
If a Criire

cannot be found out but by Miracle, it is not for any Judge
on Earth to usurp that Judgment which is reserved for the

Divine Throne.

This
pretended
Gift
of
Immersibility
attending

Witches,
is a most fallible
deceitful thing
;
for many a

Witch has sunk under the Water.
Godelmannus1 giveth

an account of six notorious and clearly convicted Witches,

that when they were brought to their vulgar Probation,
sunk down under the Water like other Persons ; Althusius

affirms the like concerning others ;
in the Bohemian His-

tory

2 it is related, that UratslausiheKiugof Bohemia, extir-

pated Witches out of
his Kingdom, some of which he de-

livered to the Ax, others of them to the Fire, and others of

them he caused to be drowned
:
If Witches are immersible,

how came they to die by drowning inBohemia ? Besides, it has

sometimes been known that Persons who have floated on the
Waterwhen the Hangman has made the Experiment on them,
have sunk down like a Stone, when others have made the tryal.

6. The Keasons commonly alledged for this Superstition

are of no moment
: It is said they hate the Water ; whereas

they have many times desired that they might be cast on

the Water in order to their purgation

:
It is alledged, that

Water
is used
in Baptism, therefore Witches swim
: A

weak Phansie
;
all the Water in the World is not consecra-

ted Water.
Cannot Witches eat Bread or drink Wine, not-

withstanding those Elements are made use of in the Blessed

Sacrament : But (say some) the Devils by sucking of them
make them so light that the Water bears them
; whereas

some Witches
are twice
as heavy
as many an innocent

Person
:
Well, but then they are possessed with the Devil
:

Suppose so
;
Is the Devil afraid if they should sink, that

he should be drowned with them 1 But why then were the

Gadarens Hogs drowned when the Devil was in them.

These
things being premised, I answer the
Question

affirmatively
; Thereare Proofsfor the Conviction ofWitches

which Jurors may with a safe Conscience proceed upon, so

as to briny them in guilty. The Scripture which saith, Thou

shalt not su/er a Witch to live, clearly implies, that some

in the "World may be known and proved to be Witches
:

For until they be so, they may and must be suffered to live.

Moreover we find in Scripture, that some have been con-

victed and executed
for Witches
: For Saul cut off those

that had familiar Spirits, and
the Wizzards out of the

Land,
1 Sam. 28.
9.

It may be wondered that Saul who
did
like him that

said, Fleeter~e si nequeo Superos Acheronta Movebo, should

cause the Wizzards in the Land to be put to death.
The

Jewish Robbies say, the reason was, because those Wizzards

foretold that David should be King.
It
is, (as Mr. Gaul

observes1

) the Opinion of some
learned Protestants, that

Saul in his Zeal did over do
: And that under the Pretext2

of Witches he slew the Gibeonites, for which
that Judg-

ment followed, 2 Sam. 21.
1.
Neither (saith Mr. Gaule)

want we the storied Examples of God's Judgments upon

those
that
defamed, prosecuted and
executed them for

Witches, that indeed were
none.
But we have
in the

Scripture the Example of a better Man than Saul to en-

courage us to make
enquiry
after Wizzards and Witches

1 In his Cases about Witchcraft, p. 181.

2 So Dr.
Wittet, conjectures on 1 Sam. 21. 1.

276
CASES OF CONSCIENCE

in order to their Conviction and Execution.
This did the

rarest King that ever lived caused to be done, viz. Josiah,

2. Kings, 23. 24.
The Workers withfamiliar Sjnrits and

the
Wizzards, that were spied in the Land of Judah, did

Josiah put aivay, that he might perform the Words of the

Law.
It seems there were some that sought to hide those

Workers of Iniquity, but that incomparable King spied
them out, and rid the Land and the World of them.

Q. But then the Enquiry is, What is sufficient Proof?
A. This Case has been with great Judgment answered

by several Divines of our own, particularly by Mr. Perkins,
and Mr. Bernard
; also Mr. John Gaul a Worthy Minister

at Staughton, in the County of Huntington, has published
a very Judicious
Discourse, called, Select Cases of Con-

science touching Witches and Witchcrafts, Printed at Lon-

don A.D. 1646. wherein he does with great Prudence and

Evidence of Scripture light handle
this and other Cases
:

Such Jurors as can obtain
those Books, I would
advise

them to read, and seriously as in the fear of God to consider

them, and so far as they keep to the Law and to the Testi-

mony, and speak according to that Word, receive the Light
which
is in them.
But the books being now rare to be had,

let me express my Concurrence
with them in these two

particulars.

1. That a free and voluntary Confession of the Crime

made by the Person suspected and accused after Examina-

tion,
is a sufficient Ground of Conviction.

Indeed,
if Persons are
distracted, or under the Power

of Phrenetick Melancholy, that alters the Case ; but the

Jurors that examine them, and their Neighbours that know

CONCERNING WITCHCRAFTS.
Til

them, may easily determine that Case
;
or if Confession be

extorted,

1 the Evidence is not so clear and convictive
; but

if any Persons
out
of Remorse
of Conscience, or from a

Touch of God in their Spirits, confess and shew their Deeds,

as the Converted Magicians in Ephesus did, Acts 19. 18,

1 9. nothing can be more clear.
Suppose a Man to be sus-

pected for Murder, or for committing a Rape, or the like

nefandous. Wickedness,
if he does freely confess the Accu-

sation, that's ground enough to Condemn him.
The Scrip-

ture approveth of Judging thewicked Servant out of his own

Mouth, Luke 19. 22.
It is by some objected, that Persons

in Discontent may falsly accuse themselves.
I say, if they

do so, and it cannot be proved that they are false Accusers

of themselves, they ought to dye for their "Wickedness, and

their Blood will be upon their own Heads
; the Jury, the

Judges, and the Land is Clear
:
I have read a very sad and

amazing, and yet a true Story to this purpose.

There was in the Year 1649, in a Town called Lauder

in Scotland, a certain woman accused and imprisoned on

suspicion of Witchcraft, when others
in the same Prison

with her were Convicted, and their Execution ordered to be

on the Monday following, she desired to speak with a Minis-

ter, to whom she declared freely that she was guilty of Witch-

craft, acknowledging also many other Crimes committed by

her, desiring that she might die with the rest
: She said

particularly that she had Covenanted with the Devil, and

was become his Servant about twenty years
before, and

that he kissed her and gave her a Name, but that since he

had never owned her.
Several Ministers who were jealous

1 V. Bodin, Dcemonomania, L.
4.

278
CASES OF CONSCIENCE

that she accused herself untruly, charged it on her Consci-

ence, telling her that they doubted she was under a Tempta-

tion of the Devil to destroy her own Body and Soul, and

adjuring her in the Name of God to
declare the Truth
:

Notwithstanding all this, she stifly adhered to what she had

said, and was on Monday morning Condemned, and ordered

to be Executed that day.
When she came to the place of

Execution, she was silent until the Prayers were ended,

then going to the Stake where she was to be Burnt, she thus

expressed herself, All you that see me this day! Know ye

that I am to die as a Witch, by my own Confession ! and
I free all Men, especially the Ministers and Magistrates,
from the guilt ofmy Blood, I take it wholly on my self, and

as I must make answer to the God of Heaven, I declare I
am as freefrom ditcheraft as any Child, but being accused

by a Malicious Woman, and Imprisoned under the Name

of a Witch, my Husband and Friends disowned me, and

seeing no hope of ever being in Credit again, through the

Temptation of the Devil, Imade that Confession to destroy
my own Life, being weary of it, and chusing rather to Die

than to Live.
This her lamentable Speech did astonish all

the Spectators, few of whom could restrain from Tears.
The Truth of this Relation (saith my Author1

) is certainly

attested by a worthy Divine now living, who was an Eye
and an Ear-Witness of the whole matter ; but thus did that

miserable Creature suffer Death, and this was a just Execu-

tion.
When the Amalekite confessed that he killed Saul,

whom he had no legal Authority to meddle with, although

Daemons, p. 122.

279

tis probable that he belyed himself, David gave order for

his Execution, and said to him, Thy Blood
be upon thy

Head, for thy Mouth hath Testified against tkee, 2 Sam.

1. 16.
But as for the Testimony of Confessing Witches

against others, the case is not so clear as against themselvep,

they are not such credible Witnesses, as in a Case of Life

and Death is to be desired
:
It is beyond dispute, that the

Devil makes his Witches to dream strange things of their -

selves and others which are not so.
There was (as Authors

beyond Exception relate) in appearance a sumptuous Feast

prepared, the Wine and Meat set forth in Vessels of Gold
;

a certain Person whom an amorous young Man had fallen

in Love with, was represented and supposed
to be really

there
; but Apollonius Tyanwus

1 discovered the Witchery

of the Business, and in an instant
all vanished, and no-

thing but dirty Coals were to be seen
: The like to this is

mentioned in the Arausican Council.
There were certain

Women that imagined they rode upon Beasts in the Night,
and that they had Diana and Herodius in company with

them, besides a Troop of other Persons ;
the Council giveth

this Sentence on it; Satanasqui se transfiguratinAngelum

Lucis, transformat se in diversaram, personarum species,
& mentem quam captivam tenet, in somnis deludit.
Satan

transforms himself into the likeness of divers Persons, and

deludes the Souls that are his Captives with Dreams and

Fancies;
see Dr. Willet on
1 Sam.
28. p. 165.
What

Credit can be given to those that say they can turn Men

into Horses ?
If so, they can as well turn Horses into Men ;

but all the Witches on Earth in Conjunction with all the

1 Boisard in vita Apollonii.

280
CASES OF CONSCIENCE

Devils in Hell, can never make or unmake a rational Soul,
and then they cannot transform a Bruit into a Man, nor a
Man into a Bruit ;
so that this Transmutation is fantasti-

cal.
The Devil may and often does impose on the Imagina-

tion of his Witches and Vassals, that they believe them-

selves
to
be
Converted
into
Beasts, and
reverted
into

Men again
; as Nebuchadnezzar whilst under the Power of

a Dtemon really imagined himself to be an Ox, and would

lye out of Doors and eat Grass
:
The Devil has inflicted

on many a Man the Disease
called Lycanthropia, from

whence they have made lamentable Complaints of their being
Wolves
:
In a word, there
is no more
Reality
in what

many Witches confess of strange things seen or done by

them, whilst Satan had them in his full Power, than there

is in Lucian's ridiculous Fable of his being Bewitched into

an Asse, and what strange Feats he then played
;
so that

what such persons relate concerning Persons and Things at

Witch-meetings, ought not to be received with too much

Credulity.

I could mention dismal Instances
of Innocent Blood

which has been shed by means of the Lies of some Con-

fessing Witches
;
there is a very sad Story mentioned in the

Preface to the Relation of the Witchcrafts in Sweedland,
how that in the Year 1676, at Stockholm, a young Woman

accused her own Mother (who had indeed been a very bad

Woman, but not guilty of Witchcraft,) and Swore that she

had carried her to the Nocturnal Meetings of Witches, upon
which
the Mother was burnt to Death.
Soon after the

Daughter came
crying and howling before the Judges in

open Court, declaring, that to be revenged on her Mother

281

for an Offence received, she had falsely accused her with a

Crime which she was not guilty of ;
for which she also was

justly Executed.
A most wicked Man
in France freely

confessed himself to be a Magician,
and accused many

others, whose Lives where thereupon taken from them
; and

a whole Province had like
to have been ruined
thereby,

but the Impostorwas discovered
: The Confessing pretended

Wizzard was burnt at Paris in the year 1668.
I
shall

only take notice further of an awful Example mentioned by

.A. B. Spotswoodin his History of Scotland, p. 449.
His

words are these,
'This Summer
(viz. Anno 1597.) there

* was a great business for the Tryal of Witches, amongst

*

others, one Margaret Afkin being apprehended on suspi-

'cion, and
threatned with
Torture,
did
confess
herself

' Guilty ; being examined touching her Associates in that

* Trade, she named a few, and perceiving her Delations

* find Credit, made offer to detect all of that
sort, and to

1 purge the Country of them
;
so she might have her Life

* granted
:
For the reason
of her Knowledge,
she
said,

' That they had a secret mark all of that sort in their Eyes,

*

ivhereby she could surely
tell, how soon she looked upon

*

any, whether they were Witches or not ; and in this she

' was so readily believed, that for the space of 3 or 4 Months

' she was carried from Town to Town to make Discoveries

1 iu that kind
; many were brought in question by her De-

'lations,
especially
at Glasgow, where
diverse Innocent

* Women, through the Credulity of the Minister Mr. John

1 Cowper, were condemned and put to Death ;
in the end

1 she was found
to be a meer deceiver, and sent back to

Fife, where she was first apprehended
: At her Tryal she

282
CASES OF CONSCIENCE

' affirmed all to be false that she had confessed of herself

* or others, and persisted in this to her Death, which made

* many fore-think
their too great forwardness that way,

1 and moved the King to recall
his Commission given out

against such Persons, discharging all Proceedings against

1 them, except in case of a voluntary Confession, till a solid

' Order should be taken by the Estates touching the form

' that should be kept in their Tryal.'
Thus that famous

Historian.

2. If two credible Persons shall affirm upon Oath that

they have seen the party accused speaking such words, or

doing things which none but such as have Familiarity with

the Devil ever did or can do, that's a sufficient Groundfor
Conviction.

Some are ready to say, that Wizzards are not so unwise

as to do such things in the sight or hearing of others, but

it is certain that they have very often been known to do so :
How often have they been seen by others using Inchant-

ments?
Conjuring to raise Storms 1 And have been heard

calling upon their Familiar Spirits ? And have been known

to use Spells and Charms?
And to shew in a Glass or in

a Shew-stone persons absent ? And to reveal Secrets which

could not be discovered but by the Devil ? And have not
men been seen
to
do things which
are above humane

Strength, that no man living could do without Diabolical

Assistances ?
Claudia was seen by Witnesses enough, to

draw a Ship which no humane
Strength
could
move.

Tuccia a Vestal Virgin was seen to carry Water in a Sieve
:

The Devil never
assists men to do supernatural things

undesired.
When therefore such like things shall be testi-

CONCERNING WITCHCRAFTS.
283

fied against the accused Party not by Spectres which are

Devils in the Shape of Persons either living or dead, but

by real men or women who may be credited ;
it
is proof

enough that such an one has that Conversation and Corres-

pondence with the Devil, as that he or she, whoever they

be, ought to be exterminated from amongst men.
This

notwithstanding I will add ;
Itwere better that ten suspected

Witches should escape, than that one innocent Person should

be Condemned ;
that
is an old
saying, and true, Prestat

reum nocentem absolvi, quam exprohibitis Indiciis & ille-

gitima probatione condemnari.
It is better that a Guilty

Person should be Absolved, than that he should without

sufficient ground of Conviction be condemned.
I had rather

judge
a Witch
to be an honest woman, than judge an

honest woman as a Witch.
The Word of God directs men

not to proceed
to the execution of the most capital offen-

ders,
until such time
as upon searching
diligently,
the

matter isfound to be a Truth, and the thing certain, Deut.

POSTSCRIPT.

[HE Design of the preceding Dissertation, is

not to plead for Witchcrafts, or to appear as

an Advocate for Witches
:
I have therefore

written another Discourse, proving that there

are such horrid Creatures as Witches in the World ; and

that they are to be extirpated and cut off from amongst the

People of God, which I have Thoughts and Inclinations in

due time to publish ; and I am abundantly satisfied that

there have been, and are still most cursed Witches in the

Land.
More than one or two of those now in Prison, have

freely and credibly acknowledged
their Communion and

Familiarity with the Spirits of Darkness ; and have also

declared unto me the Time and Occasion, with the parti-

cular
Circumstances
of
their
Hellish
Obligations
and

Abominations.

Nor
is
there designed any Reflection on those worthy

Persons who have been concerned in the late Proceedings

at Salem :
They are wise and good Men, and have acted

with all Fidelity according to their Light, and have out of

tenderness declined the doing of some things, which in our
own Judgments they were satisfied about
: Having there-

fore
so arduous a Case

rather than Censures are their due
; on which account I

am glad that there is published to the World (by my Son)
a Breviate of the Tryah of some who were lately executed,

whereby I hope the thinking part of Mankind will be satis-

fied, that there was more than that which is called Spectre
Evidence for the Conviction of the Persons condemned.
I

was not myself present at any of the Tryals, excepting one,

viz. that
of George Burroughs; had
I been one
of his

Judges, I could not have acquitted him
: For several Per-

sons did upon Oath
testifie, that they saw him do such

things as no Man that has not a Devil to be his Familiar

could perform
: And the Judges
affirm, that they have

not convicted any onemeerly on the account of what Spectres
have said, or of what has been represented to the Eyes or

Imaginations of the sick bewitched Persons.
If what is

here exposed to publick view, may be a means to prevent it

for the future, I shall not repent of my Labour in this Un-

dertaking.
I have been prevailed with so far as I am able

to
discern the Truth
in these dark Cases, to
declare my

Sentiments, with the Arguments which are of weight with

me, hoping that what is written may be of some use to dis-

cover the Depths of Satan ; and to prevent innocent ones

having their Lives endangered, or their Reputations ruined,

by being through the Subtility and Power of the Devils, in

consideration with the Ignorance and Weakness of Men,

involved amongst the
Guilty.
It becomes those of my

Profession
to be very
tender in Cases
of Blood, and to

imitate our Lord and Master, Who came not to destroy the

Lives of Men, but to save them.

I likewise design in what I have written, to give my

POSTSCRIPT.
287

testimony
against these unjustifiable ways of discovering

Witchcrafts, which some among us have
practised.
I

hear that of late there was a Witch-cake made with the

Urine of bewitched Creatures as one Ingredient, by several

Persons in a place, which has suffered much by the Attack

of Hell upon it
: This I take to be not only wicked Super-

stition, but great Folly
:
For tho' the Devil does sometimes

operate with the Experiments, yet not always, especially if

a Magical Faith be wanting.
I shall here take occasion

to recite some Passages in a Letter, which I received from

that Eminent pious and learned Man, Mr. Samuel Cradock;

during my abode in London ;
the Letter bears date Febr.

26. 1690.
Then take it in his own Words, which are these ;

1 We have at this present one in our next Town, who has

* a Son who has strange Fits, and such as they impute to

* Witchcraft
: He come to consult with me about
it, but

* before he came, he had used a means which
I
should

4 never had directed him unto,
viz. He took the Nails of

'his Son's Hands and
Feet, and some of his
Hair, and

* mixed them in Rye-Paste with his Water, and so set it

1 all by the Fire
till
it was consumed, and his Son (as he

says) was well
after, and free from his Fits for a whole

* Month, but then they came
again, and He
tried that

' means a second time, and then it would not do ; He re-

4 moved his Son into Cambridgeshire the next County, and

' then he was well, but as soon as he brought him home he

' was afflicted as
before.
The Boy says, He saw a thing

' like a Mole following of him, which once spoke to him,

' and told him he came to do the Office he was to do
:
I

* advised his Father to make use of the Medicine prescribed

288
POSTSCRIPT.

' by our Saviour, viz. Fasting and Prayer.
Here have been

1 others in this Town, that though
they were under III-

* handling as they call it
: One Family had their Milk so

'

affected, that they could not possibly make any Cheese,

* but it hov'd and swelled, and was good for nothing
: They

* are now rid of that trouble, but how they got rid of it I

* do not know

'

: Thus my Letter.
By which it is evident

that Towns
in England as
well
as Neiu-England are

molested with Dcemons, only I wish that the Superstitions

practiced in other
places to get
rid
of such
troublesome

Guests had never been known, much less used amongst us

or them.

Some I hear have taken up a Notion, that the Book

newly published by my Son, is contradictory to this of mine
:

'Tis strange that such Imaginations should enter into the

Minds of Men
: I perused and approved of that Book before

it was printed; and nothing but my Relation to him hindred
me from recommending it to the World
: But my self and

Son agreed unto the humble Advice which twelve Ministers

concurringly presented before his Excellency and Council,

respecting the present
Difficulties, which
let the World

judge, whether there be anything
in
it
dissentant from

what is attested by either of us.

It was in the Words following
:

vHE afflicted State ofourpoor Neighbours, that are
A
now suffering by Molestationsfrom the Invisible

World, we apprehend so deplorable, that we think their

Condition calls for the utmost help of all Persons in their

several Capacities.
II. We cannot but with all Thankful-

ness acknowledge, the Success which the merciful God has

given unto the sedulous and assiduous Endeavours of our

honourable Rulers,
to detect the abominable
Witchcrafts

which Jiave been committed in the Country ; humbly pray-

ing that the discovery of these mysterious and mischievous

Wickednesses, may be perfected.
III.
We judge that in

the jwosecution of these, and all such
Witchcrafts, there

is need ofa very critical and exquisite Caution, lest by too
much Credulity for things received only upon the Devil's

Authority, there be a Door opened for a
long Train of

miserable Consequences, and Satan get an advantage over

us,for ive should not be ignorant of his Devices.
IV. As

in Complaints upon Witchcrafts, there may be Matters of

Enquiry, which do not amount unto matters of Presump-

tion^ and there may be Matters of Presumption which yet
may not be reckoned Matters of Conviction; so 'tisnccessary

that all Proceedings thereabout be managed wit'h anexceed-

especially if they have been Persons formerly ofan unblem-

V. When the first Enquiry is made

into the Circumstances of such as may lie under any just

Suspicion of Witchcrafts, we could wish that there may be

admitted as little as is possible, of suck Noise, Company,
and
Openness, as may too
hastily expose them that are

examined : and that there may nothing be used as a Test,

for the Trial of the suspected, the Laivfulness whereof may

whereupon Persons may be committed, and muck mort

Convictions, whereupon Persons may
be condemned as

guilty of Witchcrafts, ought certainly to be more consider-

able, than barely the accused Person being represented by a

Spectre unto the Afflicted ; inasmuch as 'tis an undoubted
and a notorious
thing,
that a Daemon may,

Permission, appear even to ill purposes, in the Shape of
an innocent, yea, and a vertuous Man : Nor can we esteem

Alterations made in the Sufferers, by a Look or Touch of

the Accused

be an infallible Evidence of Guilt;
but

Affronts

given
to
the Devils, by our disbelieving of those Testi-

may not put a Period, unto the Progress of the dreadful

Calamity begun upon us, in the Accusation of so many

Persons, whereof we hope, some are yet clearfrom the great

Transgression laid unto their Charge.

rendered themselves obnoxious, according to the Direction

given in
t/ie Laws of God, and the wholesome Statutes of

the English Nation, for tJie Detection of JVitdicrafts.

THE END.
