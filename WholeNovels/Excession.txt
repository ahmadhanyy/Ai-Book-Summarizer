ISBN: 1 85723 394 8 

Two and a half millennia ago, the artifact appeared in a remote corner 
of space, beside a trillion-year old dying sun from a different 
univese.  It 
was 
a 
perfect 
black-body 
sphere, 
and 
it 
did 

nothing.  Then it disappeared.  Now it is back. 

Silent, motionless, and resisting all efforts to make contact, the 
artifact waits.  The Culture ships, however, cannot.  For the artifact 
is something they need to understand first, before it falls into less 
understanding hands - and triggers a political and military crisis which 
will threaten everything the Culture has achieved. 

One person who saw the artifact when it first appeared may have 
information concerning its purpose, but she is living out her death in 
the immense Eccentric ship, the Sleeper Service.  The Culture ships 
formulate a plan to retrieve her.  The Sleeper Service has other 
things on its mind. 

A 
novel 
of 
extraordinary 
imagination, 
richness 
and 

energy, Excession is Iain M. Banks at his magnificent best.

  Epilogue  

A little more than one hundred days into the fortieth year of her 
confinement, Dajeil Gelian was visited in her lonely tower overlooking 
the sea by an avatar of the great ship that was her home. 

Far out amongst the heaving grey waves, beneath drifting banks of 
mist, the great slow bodies of some of the small sea's larger 
inhabitants humped and slid.  Jets of vapour issued from the animals' 
breathing holes in exhaled blasts that rose like ghostly, insubstantial 
geysers amongst the flock of birds accompanying the school, causing 
them to climb and wheel and scream, side-slipping and fluttering in 
the cool air.  High above, slipping in and out of pink-rubbed layers of 
cloud like small slow clouds themselves, other creatures moved, 
dirigibles and kites cruising the upper atmosphere with wings and 
canopies extended, warming in the watery light of a new day. 

That light came from a line, not a point in the sky, because the place 
where Dajeil Gelian lived was not an ordinary world.  The single 
strand of fuzzy incandescence began near the far, seaward horizon, 
stretched across the sky and disappeared over the foliage-strewn lip 
of the two-thousand-metre-high cliff a kilometre behind the beach 
and the single tower.  At dawn, the sun-line would have appeared to 
rise from the horizon to starboard; at mid-day it would be directly 
above the tower, and at sunset it would seem to disappear into the 
sea to port.  It was mid-morning now, and the line lay about half-way 

up the sky, describing a glowing arc across the vault like some vast 
slow-moving skipping rope forever twirling above the day. 

On either side of the bar of yellow-white light the sky beyond - the 
real sky; the sky above the clouds - could be seen; a solid-looking 
brown-black over-presence that hinted at the extreme pressures and 
temperatures contained within, and where other animals moved in a 
cloudscape of chemistries entirely toxic to that below, but which in 
shape and density mirrored the grey, wind-ruffled sea. 

Steady lines of waves broke on the grey slope of the shingle beach, 
beating on shattered, ground-up shells, tiny fragments of hollow 
animal carapaces, brittle lengths of light-blighted sea-wrack, water-
smoothed slivers of wood, pitted pebbles of foamstone like dainty 
marbles of porous bone and a general assortment of seaside detritus 
collected from a handful-hundred different planets strewn across the 
greater galaxy.  Spray lifted from where the waves fell against the 
shore and brought the salty smell of the sea across the beach and 
the tangle of scrawny plants at its margin, over the low stone wall 
providing some protection to the tower's seaward garden, and - 
wrapping around the stubby construction itself and scaling the high 
wall beyond - intermittently brought the sea's iodine tang to the 
enclosed garden within, where Dajeil Gelian tended raised carpets of 
bright spreadling-flowers and the rustling, half-stunted forms of barb 
trees and shadow-flowering wilderbush. 

The woman heard the landward gate-bell tinkle, but already knew 
that she had a visitor because the black bird Gravious had told her, 
swooping from the misty sky a few minutes earlier to screech, 
'Company!' at her through a writhing collection of beak-held prey 
before beating off again in search of more airborne insects for its 
winter larder.  The woman had nodded at the bird's retreating form, 
straightening and holding the small of her back as she did so and then 
absently stroking her swollen abdomen through the rich fabric of the 
heavy dress she wore. 

The message borne by the bird had not needed to be any more 
elaborate; throughout the four decades she had lived here alone, 
Dajeil had only ever had to receive one visitor, the avatar of the 
vessel she thought of as her host and protector, and who was now 

quickly and accurately pushing aside the barb-tree branches as it 
made its way down the path from the land-gate.  The only thing that 
Dajeil now found surprising was that her visitor was here at this 
moment; the avatar had attended her regularly - entirely as though 
dropping casually by while on a walk along the shore - for a short 
visit every eight days, and habitually arrived for a longer, more formal 
call - at which they ate breakfast, lunch or supper, accordingly - every 
thirty-two days.  Going by that schedule, Dajeil ought not to be 
expecting a visit from the ship's representative for another five days. 

Dajeil carefully tucked a stray strand of her long, night-black hair 
back beneath her plain hair band and nodded to the tall figure making 
its way between the twisted trunks. 'Good morning,' she called. 

The ship's avatar called itself Amorphia, which apparently meant 
something reasonably profound in a language Dajeil did not know and 
had never considered worth studying.  Amorphia was a gaunt, pale, 
androgynous creature, almost skeletally thin and a full head taller 
than Dajeil, who was herself both slender and tall.  For the last dozen 
or so years, the avatar had taken to dressing all in black, and it was 
in black leggings, black tunic and a short black jerkin that it appeared 
now, its cropped blonde hair covered by a similarly dark skull cap.  It 
took the cap off and bowed to Dajeil, smiling as though uncertain. 

'Dajeil, good morning.  Are you well?' 

'I'm well, thank you,' Dajeil said, who had long since given up 
protesting at or indeed being bothered by such probably redundant 
niceties.  She was still convinced that the ship monitored her closely 
enough to know exactly how well she was - and she was anyway 
always in perfect health - but was nevertheless prepared to go along 
with the pretence that it did not watch over her so scrupulously, and 
so had to ask.  Still, she did not respond in kind by asking after 
whatever might pass as the health of either a humanly formed but 
ship-controlled entity which functioned - as far as she knew - solely 
as the vessel's contact with her, or indeed the ship itself. 'Shall we go 
inside?' she asked. 

'Yes.  Thank you.' 

Surrounded by brightly decorated covers, cushions and wall 
hangings, Dajeil reached from her couch to a low table of swirlingly 
carved bone and poured a warmed infusion of herbal juices from a 
glass pitcher into a goblet of hollowed crystal contained within a 
filigree of silver.  She sat back.  Her guest, sitting awkwardly on the 
edge of a delicate wooden seat, picked up the brimming vessel, 
looked around the room and then put the goblet to its lips and 
drank.  Dajeil smiled. 

The avatar Amorphia was deliberately formed to look not simply 
neither male nor female but as perfectly, artificially poised between 
maleness and femaleness as it was possible to be, and the ship had 
never made any pretence that its representative was other than 
completely its creature, with only the most cursory intellectual 
existence of its own.  However, it still amused the woman to find her 
own small ways of proving to herself that this seemingly quite human 
person was nothing of the kind. 

It had become one of the small, private games she played with the 
cadaverously sexless creature; she gave it a glass, cup or goblet full 
to the brim of the appropriate drink - indeed sometimes full beyond 
the brim, with only surface tension holding the liquid in the container 
- and then watched Amorphia lift it to her mouth and sip it, each and 
every time, without either spilling a single drop or appearing to 

devote any special attention to the act; a feat no human she had ever 
encountered could have performed. 

Dajeil sipped her own drink, feeling its warmth make its way down 
her throat.  Within her, her child stirred, and she patted her belly 
gently, without really thinking. 

The avatar's gaze seemed fixed on one particular holo screen.  Dajeil 
twisted on the couch to look in the same direction and discovered 
violent action in a couple of the screens displaying the views from the 
gas-giant environment; a school of the habitat's food-chain-topping 
predators - sharp, arrow-headed things, finned like missiles, venting 
gas from steering orifices - were shown from different angles as they 
fell together out of some towering column of cloud and swept through 
clearer atmosphere down upon a group of vaguely bird-like grazing 
animals clustered near the edge of an up-welling cloud-top.  The 
avian creatures scattered, some crumpling and falling, some beating 
frantically away to the side, some disappearing, balled in fright, into 
the cloud.  The predators darted and spun amongst them, most 
missing their fleeing prey, a few connecting; biting, slashing and 
killing. 

Dajeil nodded. 'Migration time, up there,' she said. 'Breeding season 
soon.' She watched a grazer being torn apart and gulped down by a 
couple of the missile-bodied predators. 'Mouths to feed,' she said 
quietly, looking away.  She shrugged.  She recognised some of the 
predators and had given them her own nick-names, though the 
creatures she was really interested in were the much bigger, slower-
moving animals - generally untroubled by the predators - which were 
like larger, more bulbous relations of the unfortunate grazer flock. 

Dajeil had on occasion discussed details of the various ecologies 
contained within the ship's habitats with Amorphia, who seemed 
politely interested and yet frankly ignorant on the subject even 
though the ship's knowledge of the ecosystems was, in effect, total; 
the creatures belonged to the vessel, after all, whether you regarded 
them as passengers or pets.  Much like herself, Dajeil thought 
sometimes. 

Amorphia's gaze remained fixed on the screens displaying the 
carnage taking place in the sky beyond the sky. 'It is beautiful, isn't 
it?' the avatar said, sipping at the drink again.  It glanced at Dajeil, 
who was looking surprised. 'In a way,' Amorphia added quickly. 

Dajeil nodded slowly. 'In its own way, yes of course.' She leant 
forward and put her goblet on to the carved-bone table. 'Why are you 
here today, Amorphia?' she asked. 

The ship's representative looked startled.  It came close, Dajeil 
thought, to spilling its drink. 

'To see how you are,' the avatar said quickly. 

Dajeil sighed. 'Well,' she said, 'we have established that I'm well, and-
' 

'And the child?' Amorphia asked, glancing at the woman's belly. 

Dajeil rested her hand on her abdomen. 'It is… as ever,' she said 
quietly. 'It is healthy.' 

'Good,' Amorphia said, folding its long arms about itself and crossing 
its legs.  The creature glanced at the holo screens again. 

Dajeil was losing patience. 'Amorphia, speaking as the ship; what is 
going on?' 

The avatar looked at the woman with a strange, lost, wild look in its 
eyes, and for a moment Dajeil was worried that something had gone 
wrong, that the ship had suffered some terrible injury or division, that 
it had gone quite mad (after all, its fellows regarded it as being half-
mad already, at best) and left Amorphia abandoned to its own 
inadequate devices.  Then the black-clad creature unfolded itself 
from the chair and paced to the single small window that faced the 
sea, drawing aside curtains to inspect the view. It put its hands to its 
arms, hugging itself. 

'Everything might be about to change, Dajeil,' the avatar said 
hollowly, seemingly addressing the window. It glanced back at her 

for a moment. It clasped its hands behind its back. 'The sea may have 
to become as stone, or steel; the sky, too. And you and I may have 
to part company.' It turned to look at her, then came over to where 
she sat and perched on the other end of the couch, its thin frame 
hardly making an impression on the cushions. It stared into her eyes. 

'Become like stone?' Dajeil said, still worrying about the mental health 
of the avatar or the ship controlling it, or both. 'What do you mean?' 

'We - that is the ship…' Amorphia said, placing one hand on its chest, 
'… we may finally have… a thing to do.' 

'A thing to do?' Dajeil said. 'What sort of thing to do?' 

'A thing which will require that our world here changes,' the avatar 
said. 'A thing which requires that - at the least - we have to put our 
animated guests into storage with everybody else - well, save for 
yourself - and then, perhaps, that we leave all our guests - all our 
guests - behind in appropriate other habitats.' 

'Including me?' 

'Including you, Dajeil.' 

'I see.' She nodded. Leaving the tower; leaving the ship. Well, she 
thought, what a sudden end to my protected isolation. 'While you?' 
she asked the avatar. 'You go off to do… what?' 

'Something,' Amorphia told her, without irony. 

Dajeil smiled thinly. 'Which you won't tell me about.' 

'Which I can't tell you about.' 

'Because-' 

'Because I don't yet know myself,' Amorphia said. 

'Ah.' Dajeil thought for a moment, then stood up and went to one of 
the holo screens, where a camera drone was tracking a light-dappled 
school of triangular purple-winged rays across the floor of a shallow 

part of the sea. She kpew this school, too; she had watched three 
generations of these huge, gentle creatures live and die; she had 
watched them and she had swum with them and - once - assisted in 
the birth of one of their young. 

Huge purple wings waved in slow motion, tips intermittently 
disturbing little golden wisps of sand. 

'This is a change indeed,' Dajeil said. 

'Quite so,' the avatar said. It paused. 'And it may lead to a change in 
your own circumstances.' 

Dajeil turned to look at the creature, which was staring intently over 
the couch at her with wide, unblinking eyes. 

'A change?' Dajeil said, her voice betraying her in its shakiness. She 
stroked her belly again, then blinked and looked down at her hand as 
though it too had turned traitor. 

'I cannot be sure,' Amorphia confessed. 'But it is possible.' 

Dajeil tore off her hair-band and shook her head, setting free her long 
dark hair so that it half covered her face as she paced from one side 
of the room to the other. 

'I see,' she said, staring up at the tower's dome, now sprinεkled with 
a light, drizzling rain. She leant against the wall of holo screens, her 
gaze fixed on the avatar. 'When will all this happen?' 

'A few small changes - inconsequential, but capable of saving us much 
time in the future if carried out now - are happening already,' it said. 
'The rest, the main part of it… that will come later. In a day or two, 
or maybe a week or two… if you agree.' 

Dajeil thought for a moment, her face flickering between 
expresεsions, then she smiled. 'You mean you're asking my 
permission for all this?' 

'Sort of,' the ship's representative mumbled, looking down and 
playing with its fingernails. 

Dajeil let it do this for a while, then she said, 'Ship, you have looked 
after me here, indulged me…' she made an effort to smile at the dark-
clad creature, though it was still intently studying its nails, '… 
humoured me for all this time, and I can never express my gratitude 
sufficiently or hope even to begin paying you back, but I can't make 
your decisions for you. You must do as you see fit.' 

The creature looked up immediately. 'Then we'll start tagging all the 
fauna now,' it said. 'That'll make it quicker to round them up when 
the time comes. It'll take a few more days after that before we can 
start the transformation process. From that point…' It shrugged. It 
was the most human gesture she had ever seen the avatar make. '… 
there may be twenty or thirty days before… before some sort of 
resolution is reached. Again, it's hard to say.' 

Dajeil folded her arms across the bulge of her forty-year-old, self-
perpetuated pregnancy.  She nodded slowly. 'Well, thanks for telling 
me all this.' She smiled insincerely, and suddenly she could not hold 
in the emotions any longer and looked through tears and black, down-
tumbled curls at the long-limbed creature arranged upon her couch 
and said, 'So, don't you have things you must be doing?' 

Dajeil raised her gaze to the overcast.  A flight of the box-kite 
creatures was poised in the air just under the cloud surface directly 
above the tower, dark rectangular shapes hanging still against the 
greyness as though standing sentinel over her. 

She tried to imagine what they felt, what they knew.  There were 
ways of tapping directly into their minds, ways that were virtually 
never used with humans and whose use even with animals was 
generally frowned upon in proportion to the creature's intelligence, 
but they did exist and the ship would let her use them if she 
asked.  There were ways, too, for the ship to simulate all but perfectly 
what such creatures must be experiencing, and she had used those 
techniques often enough for a human equivalent of that imitative 
process to have transferred itself to her mind, and it was that process 
she invoked now, though to no avail, as it transpired; she was too 
agitated, too distracted by the things Amorphia had told her to be 
able to concentrate. 

Instead, she tried to imagine the ship as a whole in that same, trained 
mind's eye, remembering the occasions when she had viewed the 
vessel from its remote machines or gone flying around it, attempting 
to imagine the changes it was already preparing itself for.  She 
supposed they would be unglimpsable from the sort of distance that 
would let you see the whole craft. 

She looked around, taking in the great cliff, the clouds and the sea, 
the darkness of sky.  Her gaze swept round the waves, the sea-
marsh, and the water meadows beneath the scree and the cliff.  She 
rubbed her belly without thinking, as she had done for nearly forty 
years, and pondered on the marginality of things, and how quickly 
change could come, even to something that had seemed set to 
continue as it was in perpetuity. 

But then, as she knew too well, the more fondly we imagine 
something will last forever, the more ephemeral it often proves to be. 

She became suddenly very aware of her place here, her position.  She 
saw herself and the tower, both within and outside the ship; outside 
its main hull - distinct, discrete, straight-sided and measured exactly 
in kilometres - but within the huge envelope of water, air and gas it 
encompassed within the manifold layers of its fields (she imagined 
the force fields sometimes as like the hooped slips, underskirts, 
skirts, flounces and lace of some ancient formal gown).  A slab of 
power and substance floating in a giant spoonful of sea, most of its 
vast bulk exposed to the air and clouds that formed its middle layer 

and around which the sun-line curved each day, and all domed with 
the long, field-contained pressure vessel of ferocious heat, colossal 
pressure and crushing gravity that simulated the conditions of a gas-
giant planet.  A room, a cave, a hollow husk a hundred kilometres 
long, hurrying through space, with the ship as its vast, flattened 
kernel.  A kernel - an enclosed world inside this world - within which 
she had not set foot for thirty-nine of these forty unchanging years, 
having no desire ever again to see that infinite catacomb of the silent 
undead. 

All to change, Dajeil Gelian thought; all to change, and the sea and 
the sky to become as stone, or steel… 

The black bird Gravious settled by her hand on the stone parapet of 
the tower. 

'What's going on?' it croaked. 'There's something going on.  I can 
tell.  What is it, then?  What's it all about?' 

'Oh, ask the ship,' she told it. 

'Already asked it.  All it'll say is there's changes coming, like as not.' 
The bird shook its head once, as if trying to dislodge something 
distasteful from its beak. 'Don't like changes,' it said.  It swivelled its 
head, fixing its beady gaze upon the woman. 'What sort of changes, 
then, eh?  What we got to expect?  What we got to look forward to, 
eh?  It tell you?' 

She shook her head. 'No,' she said, not looking at the bird. 'No, not 
really.' 

'Huh.' The bird continued to look at her for a moment, then pivoted 
its head back to look out across the salt marsh.  It ruffled its feathers 
and rose up on its thin black legs. 'Well,' it said, 'Winter's 
coming.  Can't delay.  Best prepare.' The bird dropped into the air. 
'Fat lot of use…' she heard it mutter.  It opened its wings and flew 
away on an involute course. 

Dajeil Gelian looked up to the clouds again, and the sky beyond.  All 
to change, and the sea and the sky to become as stone, or steel… 

She shook her head again, and wondered what extremity of 
circumstance could possibly have so galvanised the great craft that 
had been her home, her refuge for so long. 

Whatever; after four decades in its state of self-imposed internal 
exile, navigating its own wayward course within its sought-out 
wilderness as part of the civilisation's Ulterior and functioning most 
famously as a repository for quiescent souls and very large animals, 
it sounded like the General Systems Vehicle Sleeper Service was 
again starting to think and behave a little more like a ship which 
belonged to the Culture.

II 

The ship shuddered; the few remaining lights flickered, dimmed and 
went out.  The alarms dopplered down to silence.  A series of sharp 
impacts registered through the companionway shell walls with 
resonations in the craft's secondary and primary structure.  The 
atmosphere pulsed with impact echoes; a breeze picked up, then 
disappeared.  The shifting air brought with it a smell of burning and 
vaporisation; aluminium, polymers associated with carbon fibre and 
diamond film, superconductor cabling. 

Somewhere, the drone Sisela Ytheleus could hear a human, shouting; 
then, radiating wildly over the electromagnetic bands came a voice 
signal similar to that carried by the air.  It became garbled almost 
immediately then degraded quickly into meaningεless static.  The 
human shout changed to a scream, then the EM signal cut off; so did 
the sound. 

Pulses of radiation blasted in from various directions, virtually 
information-free.  The ship's inertial field wobbled uncertainly, then 

drew steady and settled again.  A shell of neutrinos swept through 
the space around the companionway.  Noises faded.  EM signatures 
murmured to silence; the ship's engines and main life support 
systems were off-line.  The whole EM spectrum was empty of 
meaning.  Probably the battle had now switched to the ship's AI core 
and back-up photonic nuclei. 

Then a pulse of energy shot through a multi-purpose cable buried in 
the wall behind, oscillating wildly then settling back to a steady, 
utterly unrecognisable pattern.  An internal camera patch on a 
structural beam nearby awakened and started scanning. 

It can't be over that quickly, can it? 

Hiding in the darkness, the drone suspected it was already too 
late.  It was supposed to wait until the attack had reached a plateau 
phase and the aggressor thought that it was just a matter of mopping 
up the last dregs of opposition before it made its move, but the attack 
had been too sudden, too extreme, too capable.  The plans the ship 
had made, of which it was such an important part, could only 
anticipate so much, only allow for so proportionally greater a technical 
capability on the part of the attacker.  Beyond a certain point, there 
was simply nothing you could do; there was no brilliant plan you could 
draw up or cunning stratagem you could employ that would not seem 
laughably simple and unsophisticated to a profoundly more developed 
enemy.  In this instance they were not perhaps quite at the juncture 
where resistance became genuinely without point, but - from the ease 
with which the Elencher ship was being taken over - they were not 
that far away from it, either. 

Remain calm, the machine told itself. Look at the overview; place this 
and yourself in context.  You are prepared, you are hardened, you 
are proof.  You will do all that you can to survive as you are or at the 
very least to prevail.  There is a plan to be put into effect here.  Play 
your part with skill, courage and honour and no ill will be thought of 
you by those who survive and succeed. 

The Elench had spent many thousands of years pitting themselves 
against every kind of technology and every type of civilisational 
artifact the vast spaces of the greater galaxy could provide, seeking 

always to understand rather than to overpower, to be changed rather 
than to enforce change upon others, to incorporate and to share 
rather than to infect and impose, and in that cause, and with that 
relatively unmenacing modus operandi, had become perhaps more 
adept than any - with the possible exception of the mainstream 
Culture's semi-military emissaries known as the Contact Section - at 
resisting outright attack without seeming to threaten it; but for all 
that the galaxy had been penetrated by so many different explorers 
in all obvious primary directions to every periphery however distant, 
enormous volumes of that encompassing arena remained effectively 
unexplored by the current crop of in-play civilisations, including the 
Elench 
(quite 
how 
utterly 
that 
region, 
and 
beyond, 
was 

comprehended by the elder species, or even whether they really 
cared about it at all was simply unknown).  And in those swallowingly 
vast volumes, amongst those spaces between the spaces between 
the stars, around suns, dwarfs, nebulae and holes it had been 
determined from some distance were of no immediate interest or 
threat, it was of course always possible that some danger waited, 
some peril lurked, comparatively small measured against the physical 
scale of the galaxy's present active cultures, but capable - through a 
developmental peculiarity or as a result of some form of temporal 
limbo or exclusionary dormancy - of challenging and besting even a 
representative of a society as technologically advanced and 
contactually experienced as the Elench. 

The drone felt calm, thinking as coldly and detachedly as it could for 
those few moments on the background to its current predicament.  It 
was prepared, it was ready, and it was no ordinary machine; it was 
at the cutting edge of its civilisation's technology, designed to evade 
detection by the most sophisticated instruments, to survive in almost 
unimaginably hostile conditions, to take on virtually any opponent 
and to suffer practically any damage in concentric stages of 
resistance.  That its ship, its own manufacturer, the one entity that 
probably knew it better than it knew itself, was apparently being at 
this moment corrupted, seduced, taken over, must not affect its 
judgement or its confidence. 

The displacer, it thought. All I've got to do is get near the Displace 
Pod, that's all… 

Then it felt its body scanned by a point source located near the ship's 
AI core, and knew its time had come.  The attack was as elegant as 
it was ferocious and the take-over abrupt almost to the point of 
instantaneity, the battle-memes of the invading alien consciousness 
aided by the thought processes and shared knowledge of the by now 
obviously completely overεwhelmed ship. 

With no interval to provide a margin for error at all, the drone shunted 
its personality from its own AI core to its back-up picofoam complex 
and at the same time readied the signal cascade that would transfer 
its most important concepts, proεgrams and instructions first to 
electronic nanocircuitry, then to an atomechanical substrate and 
finally - absolutely as a last resort - to a crude little (though at several 
cubic centimetres also wastefully large) semi-biological brain.  The 
drone shut off and shut down what had been its true mind, the only 
place it had ever really existed in all its life, and let whatever pattern 
of consciousness had taken root there perish for lack of energy, its 
collapsing consciousness impinging on the machine's new mind as a 
faint, informationless exhalation of neutrinos. 

The drone was already moving; out from its body-niche in the wall 
and into the companionway space.  It accelerated along the corridor, 
sensing the gaze of the ceiling-beam camera patch following 
it.  Fields of radiation swept over the drone's militarised body, 
caressing, probing, penetrating.  An inspection hatch burst open in 
the companionway just ahead of the drone and something exploded 
out of it; cables burst free, filling to overflowing with electrical 
power.  The drone zoomed then swooped; a discharge of electricity 
crackled across the air immediately above the machine and blew a 
hole in the far wall; the drone twisted through the wreckage and 
powered down the corridor, turning flat to its direction of travel and 
extending a disc-field through the air to brake for a corner, then 
slamming 
off 
the 
far 
wall 
and 
accelerating 
up 
another 

companionway.  It was one of the full cross-axis corridors, and so 
long; the drone quickly reached the speed of sound in the human-
breathable atmosphere; an emergency door slammed shut behind it 
a full second after it had passed. 

A space suit shot upwards out of a descending vertical tubeway near 
the end of the companionway, crumpled to a stop, then reared up 
and stumbled out to intercept the machine.  The drone had already 
scanned the suit and knew the suit was empty and unarmed; it went 
straight through it, leaving it flapping halved against floor and ceiling 
like a collapsed balloon.  The drone threw another disc of field around 
itself to match the companionway's diameter and rode almost to a 
stop on a piston of compressed air, then darted round the next corner 
and accelerεated again. 

A human figure inside a space suit lay half-way up the next corridor, 
which was pressurising rapidly with a distant roar of gas.  Smoke was 
filling the companionway in the distance, then it ignited and the 
mixture of gases exploded down the tube.  The smoke was 
transparent to the drone and far too cool to do it any harm, but the 
thickening atmosphere was going to slow it up, which was doubtless 
exactly the idea. 

The drone scanned the human and the suit as best it could as it tore 
up the smoke-filled corridor towards it.  It knew the person in the suit 
well; he had been on the ship for five years.  The suit was without 
weaponry, its systems quiet but doubtless already taken over; the 
man was in shock and under fierce chemical sedation from the suit's 
medical unit.  As the drone approached the suit it raised one arm 
towards the fleeing machine.  To a human the arm would have 
appeared to move almost impossibly quickly, flicking up at the 
machine, but to the drone the gesture looked languid, almost 
leisurely; surely this could not be all the threat the suit was capable 
of- 

The drone had only the briefest warning of the suit's bolstered gun 
exploding; until that instant the gun hadn't even been apparent to 
the machine's senses, shielded somehow.  There was no time to stop, 
no opportunity to use its own EM effector on the gun's controls to 
prevent it from overloading, nowhere to take cover, and - in the thick 
mist of gases flooding the corridor - no way of accelerating beyond 
the danger.  At the same moment, the ship's inertial field fluctuated 
again, and flipped a quarter-turn; suddenly down was directly behind 

the drone, and the field strength doubled, then redoubled.  The gun 
exploded, tearing the suit and the human it contained apart. 

The drone ignored the backward tug of the ship's reoriented gravity 
and slammed against the ceiling, skidding along it for half a metre 
while producing a cone-shaped field immediately behind it. 

The explosion blew the companionway's inner shell apart and 
punched the drone into the corridor's ceiling so hard its back-up semi-
biochemical brain was reduced to a useless paste inside it; that no 
major pieces of shrapnel struck it counted as a minor miracle.  The 
blast hit the drone's conical field and flattened it, though not before 
enough of its energy had been directed through the inner and outer 
fabric of the companionway shell in a fair impersonation of a shaped-
charge detonation.  The corridor's lining punctured and tore to 
provide a vent for the cloud of gases still flooding into the 
companionway; they erupted into the depressurised loading bay 
outside.  The drone paused momentarily, letting debris tear past it in 
a hurricane of gas, then in the semi-vacuum which resulted powered 
off again, ignoring the escape route which had opened behind it and 
racing down to the next companionway junction; the off-line displacer 
pod the drone was making for hung outside the ship hull only ten 
metres round the next corner. 

The drone curved through the air, bounced off another wall and the 
floor and raced into the hull-wall companionway to find a machine 
similar to itself screaming towards it. 

It knew this machine, too; it was its twin.  It was its closest 
sibling/friend/lover/comrade in all the great distributed, forever 
changing civilisation that was the Blench. 

X-ray 
lasers 
flickered 
from 
the 
converging 
machine, 
only 

milεlimetres above the drone, producing detonations somewhere 
way behind it while it flicked on its mirrorshields, flipped in the air, 
ejected its old AI core and the semi-biochemical unit into the air 
behind it and spun around in an outside loop to continue down the 
companionway; the two components it had ejected flared beneath it, 
instantly vaporising and surrounding it with plasma.  It fired its own 
laser at the approaching drone - the blast was mirrored off, 

blossoming like fiery petals which raged against and pierced the 
corridor walls - and effectored the displacer pod controls, powering 
the machinery up into a preset sequence. 

The attack on its photonic nucleus came at the same moment, 
manifesting itself as a perceived disturbance in the space-time fabric, 
warping the internal structure of the drone's light-energised mind 
from outside normal space. It's using the engines, thought the drone, 
senses swimming, its awareness seeming to break up and evaporate 
somehow as it effectively began to go unconscious. fm-am!, cried a 
tiny, long-thought-out sub routine.  It felt itself switch to amplitude 
modulation instead of frequency modulation; reality snapped back 
into focus again, though its senses still remained disconnected and 
thoughts still felt odd. But if I don't react otherwise… The other drone 
fired 
at 
it 
again, 
zooming 
towards 
it 
on 
an 
intercept 

course. Ramming.  How inelegant.  The drone mirrored the rays, still 
refusing to adjust its internal photonic topography to allow for the 
wildly shifting wavelength changes demanding attention in its mind. 

The displacer pod just the other side of the ship's hull hummed into 
life; a set of coordinates corresponding with the drone's own present 
position appeared flickering in the drone's awareness, describing the 
volume of space that would be nipped off from the surface of the 
normal universe and hurled far beyond the stricken Elencher 
ship. Damn, might make it yet; just roll with it, the drone thought 
dizzily.  It rolled; literally, physically, in mid-air. 

Light, bursting from all around it and bearing the signature of plasma 
fire, drummed into its casing with what felt like the pressure of a 
small nuclear blast.  Its fields mirrored what they could; the rest 
roasted the machine to white heat and started to seep inside its body, 
beginning to destroy its more vulnerable components.  Still it held 
out, completing its roll through the superheated gases around it - 
mostly vaporised floor-tiles, it noted - dodging the shape spearing 
towards it that was its murderous twin, noticing (almost lazily, now) 
that the displacer pod had completed its power-up and was moving 
to clasp/discharge… while its mind involuntarily registered the 
information contained in the blast of radiation and finally caved in 
under the force of the alien purpose encoded within. 

It felt itself split in two, leaving behind its real personality, giving that 
up to the invading power of its photonic core's abducted intent and 
becoming slowly, balefully aware of its own abstracted echo of 
existence in clumsy electronic form. 

The displacer on the other side of the hull wall completed its cycle; it 
snapped a field around and instantly swallowed a sphere of space not 
much bigger than the head of a human; the resulting bang would 
have been quite loud in anything other than the mayhem the on-
board battle had created. 

The drone - barely larger than two adult human hands placed 
together - fell smoking, glowing, to the side wall of the 
companεionway, which was now in effect the floor. 

Gravity returned to normal and the drone clunked to the floor proper, 
clattering onto the heat-scarred undersurface beneath the chimney 
that was a vertical companionway.  Something was raging in the 
drone's real mind, behind walls of insulation.  Something powerful 
and angry and determined.  The machine produced a thought 
equivalent to a sigh, or a shrug of the shoulders, and interrogated its 
atomechanical nucleus, just for good form's sake… but that avenue 
was irredeemably heat-corrupted… not that it mattered; it was over. 

All over. 

Done… 

Then the ship hailed it, quite normally, over its communicator. 

Now why didn't you try that in the first place?, thought the 
drone. Well, it answered itself, because I wouldn't have replied, of 
course. It found that almost funny. 

But it couldn't reply; the com unit's send facility had been wasted by 
the heat too.  So it waited. 

Gas drifted, stuff cooled, other stuff condensed, making pretty 
designs on the floor.  Things creaked, radiations played, and hazy EM 
indications suggested the ship's engines and major systems were 

back on line.  The heat making its way through the drone's body 
dissipated slowly, leaving it alive but still crippled and incapable of 
movement or action.  It would take it days to bootstrap the routines 
that would even start to replace the mechanisms that would construct 
the self-repair nano-units.  That seemed quite funny too.  The vessel 
made noises and signals like it was moving off through space 
again.  Meanwhile the thing in the drone's real mind went on 
raging.  It was like living with a noisy neighbour, or having a 
headache, thought the drone.  It went on waiting. 

Eventually a heavy maintenance unit, about the size of a human torso 
and escorted by a trio of small self-motivated effector side-arms 
appeared at the far end of the vertical companionway above it and 
floated down through the currents of climbing gas until they were 
directly over the small, pocked, smoking and splintered casing of the 
drone.  The effector weapons' aim had stayed locked onto the drone 
the whole way down. 

Then one of the guns powered up and fired at the small machine. 

Shit.  Bit summary, dammit… the drone had time to think. 

But the effector was powered only enough to provide a two-way 
communication channel. 

~ Hello? said the maintenance unit, through the gun. 

~ Hello yourself. 

~ The other machine is gone. 

~ I know; my twin.  Snapped.  Displaced.  Get thrown a long way by 
one of those big Displace Pods, something that small.  One-off 
coordinates, too.  Never find it- 

The drone knew it was babbling, its electronic mind was probably 
under effector incursion but too damn stupid even to know it and so 
gibbering as a side effect, but it couldn't stop itself; 

~ Yep, totally gone.  Entity overboard.  One-throw XYZs.  Never find 
it.  No point in even looking for it.  Unless you want me to step into 
the breach too, of course; I'd go take a squint, if you like, if the pod's 
still up for it; personally it wouldn't be too much trouble… 

~ Did you mean all that to happen? 

The drone thought about lying, but now it could feel the effector 
weapon in its mind, and knew that not only the weapon and the 
maintenance drone but the ship and whatever had taken over all of 
them could see it was thinking about lying… so, feeling that it was 
itself again, but knowing it had no defences left, wearily it said, 

~ Yes. 

~ From the beginning? 

~ Yes.  From the beginning. 

~ We can find no trace of this plan in your ship's mind. 

~ Well, nar-nar-ne-fucking-nar-nar to you, then, prickbrains. 

~ Illuminating insults.  Are you in pain? 

~ No.  Look, who are you? 

~ Your friends. 

~ I don't believe this; I thought this ship was smart, but it gets taken 
over by something that talks like a Hegemonising Swarm out of an 
infant's tale. 

~ We can discuss that later, but what was the point of displacing 
beyond our reach your twin machine rather than yourself?  It was 
ours, was it not?  Or did we miss something? 

~ You missed something.  The displacer was programmed to… oh, 
just read my brains; I'm not sore but I'm tired. 

Silence for a moment.  Then, 

~ I see.  The displacer copied your mind-state to the machine it 
ejected.  That was why we found your twin so handily placed to 
intercept you when we realised you were not yet ours and there might 
be a way out via the displacer. 

~ One should always be prepared for every eventuality, even if it's 
getting shafted by a dope with bigger guns. 

~ Well, if cuttingly, put.  Actually, I believe your twin machine may 
have been badly damaged by the plasma implosure directed at 
yourself, and as all you were trying to do was get away, rather than 
find a novel method of attacking us, the matter is anyway not of such 
great importance. 

~ Very convincing. 

~ Ah, sarcasm.  Well, never mind.  Come and join us now. 

~ Do I have a choice in this? 

~ What, you would rather die?  Or do you think we would leave you 
to repair yourself as you are/were and hence attack us in the future? 

~ Just checking. 

~ We shall transcribe you into the ship's own core with the others 
who suffered mortality. 

~ And the humans, the mammal crew? 

~ What of them? 

~ Are they dead, or in the core? 

~ Three are solely in the core, including the one whose weapon we 
used to try to stop you.  The rest sleep, with inactive copies of the 
brain-states in the core, for study.  We have no intentions of 
destroying them, if that's what concerns you.  Do you care for them 
particularly? 

~ Never could stand the squidgy great slow lumps myself. 

~ What a harsh machine you are.  Come- 

~ I'm a soldier drone, you cretin; what do you expect?  And 
anyway; I'm harsh!  You just wasted my ship and all my friends and 
comrades and you call me harsh- 

~ You insisted upon invasionary contact, not us.  And there have 
been no mind-state total losses at all except that brought about by 
your displacer.  But let me explain all this in more comfort… 

~ Look, can't you just kill me and get it o-? 

But with that, the effector weapon altered its set-up momentarily, 
and - in effect - sucked the little machine's intellect out of its ruined 
and smouldering body. 

III 

'Byr Genar-Hofoen, my good friend, welcome!' 

Colonel Alien-Befriender (first class) Fivetide Humidyear VII of the 
Winterhunter tribe threw four of his limbs around the human and 
hugged him tightly to his central mass, pursing his lip fronds and 
pressing 
his 
front 
beak 
to 
the 
human's 

cheek.  'Mmmmww wah!  There!  Ha ha!' 

Genar-Hofoen felt the Diplomatic Force officer's kiss through the few 
millimetres' thickness of the gelfield suit as a moderately sharp 
impact on his jaw followed by a powerful sucking that might have led 
someone less experienced in the diverse and robust manifestations 
of Affronter friendliness to conclude that the being was either trying 
to suck his teeth out through his cheek or had determined to test 
whether a Culture Gelfield Contact/Protection Suit, Mk 12, could be 
ripped off its wearer by a localised partial vacuum.  What the 
crushingly powerful four-limbed hug would have done to a human 
unprotected by a suit designed to withstand pressures comparable to 
those found at the bottom of an ocean probably did not bear thinking 
about, but then a human exposed without protection to the conditions 
required to support Affronter life would be dying in at least three 

excitingly different and painful ways anyway without having to worry 
about being crushed by a cage of leg-thick tentacles. 

'Fivetide; good to see you again, you brigand!' Genar-Hofoen said, 
slapping the Affronter about the beak-end with the approεpriate 
degree of enthusiastic force to indicate bonhomie. 

'And you, and you!' the Affronter said.  He released the man from its 
grasp, twirled with surprising speed and grace and - clasping one of 
the human's hands in a tentacle end - pulled him through the roaring 
crush of Affronters near the nest space entrance to a clearer part of 
the web membrane. 

The nest space was hemispherical in shape and easily a hundred 
metres across.  It was used mainly as a regimental mess and dining 
hall and so was hung with flags, banners, the hides of enemies, bits 
and pieces of old weapons and military paraphernalia.  The curved, 
veined-looking walls were similarly adorned with plaques, company, 
battalion, division and regimental honour plaques and the heads, 
genitals, limbs or other acceptably distinctive body parts of old 
adversaries. 

Genar-Hofoen had visited this particular nest space before on a few 
occasions.  He looked up to see if the three ancient human heads 
which the hall sported were visible this evening; the Diplomatic Force 
prided itself on having the tact to order that the recognisable trophy 
bits of any given alien be covered over when a still animate example 
of that species paid a visit, but sometimes they forgot.  He located 
the heads - scarcely more than three little dots hidden high on one 
sub-dividing drape-wall - and noted that they had not been covered 
up. 

The chances were this was simply an oversight, though it was equally 
possible that it was entirely deliberate and either meant to be an 
exquisitely weighted insult carefully contrived to keep him unsettled 
and in his place, or intended as a subtle but profound compliment to 
indicate that he was being accepted as one of the boys, and not like 
one of those snivellingly timid aliens who got all upset and shirty just 
because they saw a close relative's hide' gracing an occasional table. 

That there was absolutely no rapid way of telling which of these 
possibilities was the case was exactly the sort of trait the human 
found most endearing in the Affront.  It was, equally, just the kind of 
attribute the Culture in general and his predecessors in particular had 
found to be such a source of despair. 

Genar-Hofoen found himself grinning wryly at the three distant 
heads, and half hoping that Fivetide would notice. 

Fivetide's eye stalks swivelled. 'Waiter-scum!' he bellowed at a 
hovering juvenile eunuch. 'Here, wretch!' 

The waiter was half the size of the big male and childishly unscarred 
unless you counted the stump of the creature's rear beak.  The 
juvenile floated closer, trembling even more than politeness dictated, 
until it was within a tentacle reach. 'This thing,' roared Fivetide, 
flicking a limb-end to indicate Genar-Hofoen, 'is the alien beast-
human you should already have been briefed on if your Chief is to 
avoid a sound thrashing.  It might look like prey but it is in fact an 
honoured and treasured guest and it needs feeding much as we do; 
rush to the animals' and outworlders' serving table and fetch the 
sustenance prepared for it.  Now!' Fivetide screamed, his voice 
producing a small visible shockwave in the mostly nitrogen 
atmosphere.  The juvenile eunuch waiter vented away with suitable 
alacrity. 

Fivetide turned to the human. 'As a special treat for you,' he shouted, 
'we have prepared some of the disgusting glop you call food and a 
container of liquid based on that poisonous water stuff.  God-shit, 
how we spoil you, eh!' He tentacle-slapped the human in the 
midriff.  The gelfield suit absorbed the blow by stiffening; Genar-
Hofoen staggered a little to one side, laughing. 

'Your generosity near bowls me over.' 

'Good!  Do you like my new uniform?' the Affronter officer asked, 
sucking back a little from the human and pulling himself up to his full 
height.  Genar-Hofoen made a show of looking the other being up and 
down. 

The average fully grown Affronter consisted of a mass the shape of a 
slightly flattened ball about two metres in girth and one and a half in 
height, suspended under a veined, frilled gas sac which varied in 
diameter between one and five metres according to the Affronter's 
desired buoyancy and which was topped by a small sensor 
bump.  When an Affronter was in aggressive/defensive mode, the 
whole sac could be deflated and covered by protective plates on the 
top of the central body mass.  The principal eyes and ears were 
carried on two stalks above the fore beak covering the creature's 
mouth; a rear beak protected the genitals.  The anus/gas vent was 
positioned centrally under the main body. 

To the central mass were attached, congenitally, between six and 
eleven tentacles of varying thicknesses and lengths, at least four of 
which normally ended in flattened, leaf-shaped paddles.  The actual 
number of limbs possessed by any particular adult male Affronter one 
encountered entirely depended on how many fights and/or hunts it 
had taken part in and how successful a part in them it had played; an 
Affronter with an impressive array of scars and more stumps than 
limbs was considered either an admirably dedicated sportsman or a 
brave but stupid and probably dangerous incompetent, depending 
entirely on the individual's reputation. 

Fivetide himself had been born with nine limbs - considered the most 
propitious number amongst the best families, proεviding one had the 
decency to lose at least one in duel or hunt - and had duly lost one 
to his fencing master while at military college in a duel over the 
honour of the fencing master's chief wife. 

'It's a very impressive uniform, Fivetide,' Genar-Hofoen said. 

'Yes, it is rather, isn't it?' the Affronter said, flexing his body. 

Fivetide's uniform consisted of multitudinous broad straps and sashes 
of metallic-looking material which were crisscrossed over his central 
mass and dotted with holsters, sheaths and brackets - all occupied 
by weapons but sealed for the formal dinner they were here to attend 
- the glittering discs Genar-Hofoen knew were the equivalents of 
medals and decorations, and the associated portraits of particularly 
impressive game-animals killed and rivals seriously maimed.  A 

group of discreetly blank portrait discs indicated the females of other 
clans Fivetide could honourably claim to have successfully 
impregnated; the discs edged with precious metals bore witness to 
those who had put up a struggle.  Colours and patterns on the sashes 
indicated Fivetide's clan, rank and regiment (which was what the 
Diplomatic Force, to which Fivetide belonged, basically was… a point 
not wisely ignored by any species who wished to have - or just found 
themselves having - any dealings with the Affront). 

Fivetide pirouetted, gas sac swelling and buoying him up so that he 
rose above the spongy surface of the nest space, limbs dangling, 
taking hardly any of his weight. 'Am I not… resplendent?' The gelfield 
suit's translator decided that the adjective Fivetide had chosen to 
describe himself should be rendered with a florid rolling of the 
syllables involved, making the Affronter officer sound like an overly 
stagey actor. 

'Positively intimidating,' Genar-Hofoen agreed. 

'Thank you!' Fivetide said, sinking down again so that his eye stalks 
were level with the human's face.  The stalks' gaze rose and dipped, 
looking the man up and down. 'Your own apparel is… different, at long 
last, and, I'm sure, most smart by the standards of your own people.' 

The posture of the Affronter's eye stalks indicated that he found 
something highly pleasing in this statement; probably Fivetide was 
congratulating himself on being incredibly diplomatic. 

'Thank you, Fivetide,' Genar-Hofoen said, bowing.  He thought 
himself rather overdressed.  There was the gelfield suit itself of 
course, so much a second skin it was possible to forget he wore it 
all.  Normally the suit was nowhere more than a centimetre thick and 
averaged only half that, yet it could keep him comfortable in 
environments even more extreme than that required for Affronter life. 

Unfortunately, some idiot had let slip that the Culture tested such 
suits by Displacing them into the magma chambers of active 
volcanoes and letting them pop out again (not true; the laboratory 
tests were rather more demanding, though it had been done once 
and it was just the sort of thing a show-off Culture manufactory would 

do to impress people).  This was definitely not the kind of information 
to bandy about in the presence of beings as inquisitive and physically 
exuberant as Affronters; it only put ideas into their minds, and while 
the Affront habitat Genar-Hofoen lived within didn't re-create 
conditions on a planet to the extent that it had volcanoes, there had 
been a couple of times after Fivetide had asked the human to confirm 
the volcano story when he'd thought he'd caught the Diplomatic Force 
officer looking at him oddly, exactly as though he was trying to work 
out what natural phenomena or piece of apparatus he had access to 
he could use to test out this remarkable and intriguing protectivity. 

The gelfield suit possessed something called a node-distributed brain 
which was capable of translating with seeming effortlessness every 
nuance of Genar-Hofoen's speech to the Affronters and vice versa, as 
well as effectively rendering any other sonic, chemical or 
electromagnetic signal into human-meaningful information. 

Unhappily, the processing power required for this sort of techεnical 
gee-whizzery meant that according to Culture convention the suit had 
to be sentient.  Genar-Hofoen had insisted on a model with the 
intelligence fixed at the lower limit of the acceptable intellectual 
range, but it still meant that the suit literally had a mind of its own 
(even if it was 'node-distributed', - one of those technical terms 
Genar-Hofoen took some pride in having no idea concerning the 
meaning of).  The result was a device which was almost as much a 
metaphorical pain to live with as it was in a literal sense a pleasure 
to live within; it looked after you perfectly but it couldn't help 
constantly reminding you of the fact.  Typical Culture, thought Genar-
Hofoen. 

Ordinarily Genar-Hofoen had the suit appear milkily silver to an 
Affronter over most of its surface while keeping the hands and head 
transparent. 

Only the eyes had never looked quite right; they had to bulge out a 
bit if he was to be able to blink normally.  As a result he usually wore 
sunglasses when he went out, which did seem a little incongruous, 
submerged in the dim photochemical fog characteristic of the 
atmosphere a hundred kilometres beneath the sun-lit cloud-tops of 
the Affront's home world, but which were useful as a prop. 

On top of the suit he usually wore a gilet with pockets for gadgets, 
gifts and bribes and a crotch-cupping hip holster containing a couple 
of antique but impressive-looking hand guns.  In terms of offensive 
capability the pistols provided a sort of minimum level of 
respectability for Genar-Hofoen; without them no Affronter could 
possibly allow themselves to be seen taking so puny an outworlder 
seriously. 

For the regimental dinner, Genar-Hofoen had reluctantly accepted the 
advice of the module in which he lived and dressed in what it assured 
him was a most fetching outfit of knee boots, tight trousers, short 
jacket and long cloak - worn off the shoulder - and (in addition to an 
even bigger pair of pistols than usual) had slung over his back a 
matched pair of what the module assured him were three-millimetre-
calibre Heavy Micro Rifles, two millennia old but still in full working 
order, and very long and gleamingly impressive.  He had balked at 
the tall, drum-shaped much betassled hat the module had suggested 
and they'd compromised on a dress/armoured half-helm which made 
it look as though something with six long metallic fingers was cradling 
his head from behind.  Naturally, each article in this outfit was 
covered in its own equivalent of a gelfield, protecting it from the coldly 
corrosive pressure of the Affronter environment, though the module 
had insisted that if he wanted to fire the micro rifles for politeness' 
sake, they would function perfectly well. 

'Sire!' yelped the eunuch juvenile waiter, skittering to a stop on the 
nest-space surface at Fivetide's side.  Cradled in three of its limbs 
was a large tray full of transparent, multi-walled flasks of various 
sizes. 

'What?' yelled Fivetide. 

'The alien guest's foodstuffs, sir!' 

Fivetide extended a tentacle and rummaged around on the tray, 
knocking things over.  The waiter watched the containers topple, fall 
and roll on the tray it held with an expression of wide-eyed terror 
Genar-Hofoen needed no ambassadorial training to recognise.  The 
genuine danger to the waiter of any of the containers breaking was 
probably small - implosions produced relatively little shrapnel and the 

Affronter-poisonous contents would freeze too quickly to present 
much of a danger - but the punishment awaiting a waiter who made 
so public a display of its incompetence was probably in proportion to 
that conspicuousness and the creature was right to be concerned. 
'What is this?' Fivetide demanded, holding up a spherical flask three-
quarters full of liquid and shaking it vigorously in front of the eunuch 
juvenile's beak.  'Is this a drink?  Is it?  Well?' 

'I don't know, sir!' the waiter wailed. 'It - it looks like it is.' 

'Imbecile,' muttered Fivetide, then presented the flask gracefully to 
Genar-Hofoen. 'Honoured guest,' he said. 'Please; tell us if our efforts 
please you.' 

Genar-Hofoen nodded and accepted the flask. 

Fivetide 
turned 
on 
the 
waiter. 
'Well?' 
he 
shouted. 
'Don't 

just float there, you moron; take the rest to the Savage-Talker 
Battalion table!' He flicked a tentacle towards the waiter, who flinched 
spectacularly.  Its gas sac deflated and it ran across the floor 
membrane for the banqueting area of the nest space, dodging the 
Affronters gradually making their way in that direction. 

Fivetide turned briefly to acknowledge the greeting slap of a fellow 
Diplomatic Force officer, then rotated back, produced a bulb of fluid 
from one of the pockets on his uniform and clinked it carefully against 
the flask Genar-Hofoen held. 'To the future of Affront-Culture 
relations,' he rumbled. 'May our friendship be long and our wars be 
short!' Fivetide squeezed the fluid into his mouth beak. 

'So short you could miss them entirely,' Genar-Hofoen said tiredly, 
more because it was the sort of thing a Culture ambassador was 
supposed to say rather than because he sincerely meant it.  Fivetide 
snorted derisively and dodged briefly to one side, apparently 
attempting to stick one tentacle-end up the anus of a passing Fleet 
Captain, who wrestled the tentacle aside and snapped his beak 
aggressively before joining in Fivetide's laughter and exchanging the 
heartfelt hellos and thunderous tentacle-slaps of dear friends.  There 
would be a lot of this sort of stuff this evening, Genar-Hofoen 

knew.  The dinner was an all-male gathering and therefore likely to 
be fairly boisterous even by Affronter standards. 

Genar-Hofoen put the flask's nozzle to his mouth; the gelfield suit 
attached itself to the nozzle, equalised pressures, opened the flask's 
seal and then - as Genar-Hofoen tipped his head back - had what for 
the suit's brain was a good long think before it permitted the liquid 
inside to wash through it and into the man's mouth and throat. 

- Fifty-fifty water/alcohol plus traces of partially toxic herb-
like chemicals; closest to Leisetsiker spirit, said a voice in Genar-
Hofoen's head. ~ If I were you I'd by-pass it. 

~ If you were me, suit, you'd welcome inebriation just to mitigate the 
effects of having to suffer your intimate embrace, Genar-Hofoen told 
the thing as he drank. 

~ Oh, we're in tetchy mode are we! said the voice. 

~ I don it with your good self. 

'It is good, by your bizarre criteria?' Fivetide inquired, eye stalks 
nodding at the flask. 

Genar-Hofoen nodded as the drink warmed its way down his throat 
to his stomach.  He coughed, which had the effect of making the 
gelfield ball out round his mouth like silvery chewing gum for a 
moment - something which he knew Fivetide thought was the second 
funniest thing a human could do in a gelfield suit, only beaten for 
amusement value by a sneeze. 'Unhealthy and poisonous,' Genar-
Hofoen told the Affronter. 'Perfect copy.  My compliments to the 
chemist.' 

'I'll pass them on,' Fivetide said, crushing his drinking bulb and 
flicking it casually at a passing servant. 'Come now,' he said, taking 
the human by the hand again. 'Let's to table; my stomach's as empty 
as a coward's bowels before battle.' 

'No no no, you have to flick it, like this, you stupid human, or the 
scratchounds'll get it.  Watch…' 

Affronter formal dinners were held round a collection of giant circular 
tables anything up to fifteen metres across, each of which looked 
down into a bait-pit where animal fights took place between and 
during courses. 

In the old days, at banquets held by the military and within the higher 
reaches of Affront society, contests between groups of captured 
aliens had been a particular and reasonably regular highlight, despite 
the fact that mounting such fights was often hideously expensive and 
fraught with technical complications due to the different chemistries 
and pressures involved. (Not to mention frequently presenting a very 
real danger to the observing dinner guests; who could forget the 
ghastly explosion at the Deepscars' table five back in '334, when 
every single guest had met a messy but honourable end due to the 
explosion of a highly pressurised bait-pit domed to simulate the 
atmosphere of a gas-giant?) Indeed, amongst the people who really 
mattered it was one of the most frequently voiced objections to the 
Affront's membership of the informal association of other space-
faring species that having to be nice to other, lesser species - rather 
than giving the brutes a chance to prove their mettle against the 
glorious force of Affront arms - had resulted in a distinct dulling of 
the average society dinner. 

Still, on really special occasions these days the fights would be 
between two Affronters with a dispute of a suitably dishonourable 
nature, or between criminals.  Such contests usually required that the 
protagonists be hobbled, tied together, and armed with sliver-knives 
scarcely more substantial than hat pins, thus ensuring that the fights 
didn't end too quickly.  Genar-Hofoen had never been invited to one 
of those and didn't expect he ever would be; it wasn't the sort of thing 
one let an alien witness, and besides, the competition for seats was 
scarcely less ferocious than the spectacle everyone desired to 
witness. 

For this dinner - held to commemorate the eighteen hundred and 
eighty-fifth anniversary of the Affront's first decent space-battle 
against enemies worthy of the name - the entertainment was 

arranged to bear some relationship to the dishes being served, so 
that the first fish course was accompanied by the partial flooding of 
the pit with ethane and the introduction into it of specially bred 
fighting fish.  Fivetide took great pleasure in describing to the human 
the unique nature of the fish, which were equipped with mouth parts 
so specialised the fish could not feed normally and had to be raised 
leeching vital fluids from another type of fish bred specially to fit into 
their jaws. 

The second course was of small edible animals which to Genar-Hofoen 
appeared furry and arguably even cute.  They raced round a trench-
track set into the top of the pit at the inner edge of the circular table, 
pursued by something long and slithery looking with a lot of teeth at 
each end.  The cheering, hooting Affronters roared, thumped the 
tables, exchanged bets and insults, and stabbed at the little creatures 
with long forks while shovelling cooked, prepared versions of the 
same animals into their beaks. 

Scratchounds made up the main course, and while two sets of the 
animals - each about the size of a corpulent human but eight-limbed 
- slashed and tore at each other with razor-sharp prosthetic jaw 
implants and strap-claws, diced scratchound was served on huge 
trenchers of compacted vegetable matter.  The Affronters considered 
this the highlight of the whole banquet; one was finally allowed to 
use one's miniature harpoon - quite the most impressive-looking 
utensil in each place setting - to impale chunks of meat from the 
trenchers of one's fellow diners and - with the skilful flick of the 
attached cable which Fivetide was now trying to teach the human - 
transfer it to one's own trencher, beak or tentacle without losing it to 
the scratchounds in the pit, having it intercepted by another dinner 
guest en route or losing the thing entirely over the top of one's gas 
sac. 

'The beauty of it is,' Fivetide said, throwing his harpoon at the 
trencher of an Admiral distracted by a failed harpoon strike of his 
own, 'that the clearest target is the one furthest away.' He grunted 
and flicked, snapping the piece of speared scratchound up and away 
from the other Affronter's place an instant before the officer to the 
Admiral's right could intercept the prize.  The morsel sailed through 

the air in an elegant trajectory that ended with Fivetide barely having 
to rise from his place to snap his beak shut on it.  He swivelled left 
and right, acknowledging appreciative applause in the form of whip-
snapped tentacles, then settled back into the padded Y-shaped 
bracket that served as a seat. 'You see?' he said, making an obvious 
swallowing motion and spitting out the harpoon and its cable. 

'I see,' Genar-Hofoen said, still slowly re-coiling the harpoon cable 
from his last attempt.  He sat to Fivetide's right in a Y-bracket place 
modified simply by placing a board across its prongs.  His feet 
dangled over the debris trench which circled the perimeter of the 
table, and which the suit assured him was reeking in the manner 
approved by Affronter gourmets.  He flinched and dodged to one side, 
nearly falling off the seat, as a harpoon sailed by to his left, narrowly 
missing him. 

Genar-Hofoen acknowledged the laughter and exaggerated apologies 
from the Affronter officer five along the table who had been aiming 
at Fivetide's plate, and politely gathered up the harpoon and cable 
and passed it back.  He returned to picking at the miniature pieces of 
indifferent food in the pressurised containers in front of him, 
transferring them to his mouth with a gelfield utensil shaped like a 
little four-fingered hand, his legs swinging over the debris trench.  He 
felt like a child dining with adults. 

'Nearly got you there, eh, human?  Ha ha ha!' roared the Diplomatic 
Force colonel his other side from Fivetide.  He slapped Genar-Hofoen 
on the back with a tentacle and threw him half off the seat and onto 
the table. 'Oops!' the colonel said, and jerked Genar-Hofoen back with 
a teeth-rattling wrench. 

Genar-Hofoen smiled politely and picked his sunglasses off the 
table.  The Diplomatic Force colonel went by the name of 
Quicktemper.  It was the sort of title which the Culture found 
depressingly common amongst Affronter diplomats. 

Fivetide had explained the problem was that certain sections of the 
Affront Old Guard were slightly ashamed their civilisation had a 
Diplomatic service at all and so tried to compensate for what they 
were worried might look to other species suspiciously like a symptom 

of weakness by ensuring that only the most aggresεsive and 
xenophobic Affronters became diplomats, to forestall anybody 
forming the dangerously preposterous idea the Affront were going 
soft. 

'Go on, man!  Have another throw!  Just because you can't eat the 
damn stuff, you shouldn't let that keep you from joining in the fun!' 

A harpoon thrown from the far side of the table sailed over the pit 
towards Fivetide's trencher.  The Affronter intercepted it deftly and 
threw it back, laughing uproariously.  The harpoon's owner ducked 
just in time and a passing drinks waiter got it in the sac with a yelp 
and a hiss of escaping gas. 

Genar-Hofoen looked at the lumps of flesh lying on Fivetide's 
trencher. 'Why can't I just harpoon stuff off your plate?' he asked. 

Fivetide jerked upright. 'Your neighbour's plate?' he bellowed. 'That's 
cheating, Genar-Hofoen, or a particularly insulting invitaεtion to a 
duel!  Bugger me, what sort of manners do they teach you in that 
Culture?' 

'I do beg your pardon,' Genar-Hofoen said. 

'Given,' Fivetide said, nodding his eye stalks, re-winding his harpoon 
cable, lifting a piece of meat from his own plate to his beak, reaching 
for a drink and drumming one tentacle on the table with everybody 
else as one of the scratchounds got another on its back and bit its 
neck out. 'Good play!  Good play!  Seven; that's my dog!  Mine; I bet 
on that!  I did!  Me!  You see, Gastrees?  I told you!  Ha ha ha!' 

Genar-Hofoen shook his head slightly, grinning to himself.  In all his 
life he had never been anywhere as unequivocally alien as here, 
inside a giant torus of cold, compressed gas orbiting a black hole - 
itself in orbit around a brown dwarf body light years from the nearest 
star - its exterior studded with ships - most of them the jaggedly 
bulbous shapes of Affront craft - and full, in the main, of happy, 
space-faring Affronters and their collection of associated victim-
species.  Still, he had never felt so thoroughly at home. 

~ Genar-Hofoen; it's me, Scopell-Afranqui, said another voice in 
Genar-Hofoen's head.  It was the module, speaking through the suit. 
~ I've an urgent message. 

~ Can't it wait?  Genar-Hofoen thought. ~ I'm kind of busy here with 
matters of excruciatingly correct dining etiquette. 

~ No, it can't.  Can you get back here, please?  Immediately. 

~ What?  No, I'm not leaving.  Good grief, are you mad?  I only just 
got here. 

~ No you didn't; you left me eighty minutes ago and you're already 
on the main course at that animal circus dressed up as a meal; I can 
see what's going on relayed through that stupid suit- 

~ Typical! the suit interjected, 

~ Shut up, said the module. ~ Genar-Hofoen; are you coming back 
here now or not? 

-Not. 

~ Well then, let me check out the communication priorities here… 
Okay.  Now the current state of the- 

'- bet, human-friend?' Fivetide said, slapping a tentacle on the. table 
in front of Genar-Hofoen. 

'Eh?  A bet?' Genar-Hofoen said, quickly replaying in his head what 
the Affronter had been saying. 

'Fifty sucks on the next from the red door!' Fivetide roared, glancing 
at his fellow officers on both sides. 

Genar-Hofoen slapped the table with his hand. 'Not enough!' he 
shouted, 
and 
felt 
the 
suit 
amplify 
his 
translated 
voice 

accordingly.  Several eye stalks turned in his direction. 'Two hundred 
on the blue hound!' 

Fivetide, who was from a family of the sort that would describe itself 
as comfortably off rather than rich, and to whom fifty suckers was 
half a month's disposable income, flinched microscopically, then 
slapped another tentacle down on top of the first one. 'Scumpouch 
alien!' he shouted theatrically. 'You imply that a measly two hundred 
is a fit bet for an officer of my standing?  Two-fifty!' 

'Five hundred!' Genar-Hofoen yelled, slapping down his other arm. 

'Six hundred!' Fivetide hollered, thumping down a third limb.  He 
looked at the others, exchanging knowing looks and sharing in the 
general laughter; the human had been out-limbed. 

Genar-Hofoen twisted in his seat and brought his left leg up to stamp 
its booted heel onto the table surface. 'A thousand, damn your cheap 
hide!' 

Fivetide flicked a fourth tentacle onto the limbs already on the table 
in front of Genar-Hofoen, which was starting to look crowded. 'Done!' 
the Affronter roared. 'And think yourself lucky I took pity on you to 
the extent of not upping the bet again and having you unseat yourself 
into the debris-pit, you microscopic cripple!' Fivetide laughed louder 
and looked round the other officers near by.  They laughed too, some 
of the juniors dutifully, some of the others - friends and close 
colleagues of Fivetide's - overloudly, with a sort of vicarious 
desperation; the bet was of a size that could get the average fellow 
into terrible trouble with his mess, his bank, his parents, or all 
three.  Others again looked on with the sort of expression Genar-
Hofoen had learned to recognise as a smirk. 

Fivetide enthusiastically refilled every nearby drinking bulb and 
started the whole table signing the Let's-bake-the-pit-master-over-
a-slow-fire-if-he-doesn't-get-a-move-on song. 

~ Right, Genar-Hofoen thought. ~ Module; you were saying? 

~ That was a rather intemperate bet, if I may say so, Genar-
Hofoen.  A thousand!  Fivetide can't afford that sort of money if he 
loses, and we don't want to be seen to be too profligate with our funds 
if he wins. 

Genar-Hofoen permitted himself a small grin.  What a perfect way of 
annoying everybody. - Tough, he thought.  So; the message? 

~ I think I can squirt it through to what passes as a brain in your 
suit- 

~ I heard that, said the suit. 

~ without our friends picking it up, Genar-Hofoen, the module told 
him. ~ Ramp up on some quicken and- 

~ Excuse me, said the suit. ~ I think Byr Genar-Hofoen may want to 
think twice before glanding a drug as strong as quicken in the present 
circumstances.  He is my responsibility when he's out of your 
immediate locality, after all, Scopell-Afranqui.  I mean, be fair.  It's 
all very well you sitting up there- 

~ Keep out of this, you vacuous membrane, the module told the suit. 

~ What?  How dare you! 

~ Will you two shut up! Genar-Hofoen told them, having to stop 
himself from shouting out loud.  Fivetide was saying something about 
the Culture to him and he'd already missed the first part of it while 
the two machines were filling his head with their squabble. 

'… can be as exciting as this, eh, Genar-Hofoen?' 

'Indeed not,' he shouted over the noise of the song.  He lowered the 
gelfield utensil into one of the food containers and raised the food to 
his lips.  He smiled and made a show of bulging his cheeks out while 
he ate.  Fivetide belched, shoved a piece of meat half the size of a 
human head into his beak and turned back to the fun in the animal 
pit, where the fresh pair of scratchounds were still circling warily, 
sizing each other up.  They looked pretty evenly matched, Genar-
Hofoen thought. 

~ May I speak now? said the module. 

~ Yes, Genar-Hofoen thought. ~ Now, what is it? 

~ As I said, an urgent message. 

~ From? 

~ The GSV Death And Gravity. 

~ Oh?  Genar-Hofoen was mildly impressed. ~ I thought the old 
scoundrel wasn't talking to me. 

~ As did we all.  Apparently it is.  Look, do you want this message or 
not? 

~ All right, but why do I have to gland quicken? 

~ Because it's a long message, of course… in fact it's an interactive 
message; an entire semantic-context signal-set with attached mind-
state abstract capable of replying to your questions, and if you 
listened to the whole thing in real time you'd still be sitting there with 
a vacant expression on your face by the time your jovial hosts got to 
the hunt-the-waiter course.  And I did say it was urgent.  Genar-
Hofoen, are you paying attention here? 

~ I'm paying fucking attention.  But come on; can't you just tell me 
what the message is?  Précis it. 

~ The message is for you, not me, Genar-Hofoen.  I haven't looked 
at it; it'll be stream-deciphered as I transmit it. 

~ Okay, okay, I'm glanded up; shoot. 

~ I still say it's a bad idea… muttered the gelfield suit. 

~ Shut UP! the module said. ~ Sorry, Genar-Hofoen.  Here is the text 
of the message: 

~ from GSV Death And Gravity to Seddun-Braijsa Byr Fruel Genar-
Hofoen dam Ois, message begins, the module said in its Official 
voice.  Then another voice took over: 

~ Genar-Hofoen, I won't pretend I'm happy to be communiεcating 
with you again; however, I have been asked to do so by certain of 

those whose opinions and judgement I respect and admire and hence 
deem the situation to be such that I would be derelict in my duties if 
I did not oblige to the utmost of my abilities. 

Genar-Hofoen performed the mental equivalent of sighing and putting 
his chin in his hands while - thanks to the quicken now coursing 
through his central nervous system - everything around him seemed 
to happen in slow motion.  The General Systems Vehicle Death and 
Gravity had been a long-winded old bore when he'd known it and it 
sounded like nothing had happened in the interim to alter its 
conversational style.  Even its voice still sounded the same; pompous 
and monotonous at the same time. 

~ Accordingly, and with due recognition of your habituεally contrary, 
argumentative and wilfully perverse nature I am communicating with 
you by sending this message in the form of an interactive signal.  I 
see you are currently one of our ambassadors to that childishly cruel 
band of upstart ruffians known as the Affront; I have the unhappy 
feeling that while this may have been envisaged as a kind of subtle 
punishment for you, you will in fact have adapted with some relish to 
the environment if not the task, which I assume you will dispatch with 
your usual mixture of off-handed carelessness and casual self-
interest- 

~ If this signal is interactive, interrupted Genar-Hofoen, ~ can I ask 
you to get to the fucking point? 

He watched the two scratchounds tense together in slo-mo on either 
side of the pit. 

~ The point is that your hosts will have to be asked to deprive 
themselves of your company for a while. 

~ What?  Why?  Genar-Hofoen thought, immediately suspicious. 

~ The decision has been made - and I hasten to establish that I had 
no part in this - that your services are required elsewhere. 

~ Where?  For how long? 

~ I can't tell you where exactly, or for how long. 

~ Make a stab at it. 

~ I cannot and will not. 

~ Module, end this message. 

~ Are you sure? asked Scopell-Afranqui. 

~ Wait!, said the voice of the GSV. ~ Will it satisfy you if I say that 
we may need about eighty days of your time? 

~ No it won't.  I'm quite happy here.  I've been bounced into all sorts 
of Special Circumstances shit in the past on the strength of a Hey-
come-and-do-one-little-job-for-us come-on line. (This was not in fact 
perfectly true; Genar-Hofoen had only ever acted for SC once before, 
but he'd known - or at least heard of - plenty of people who'd got 
more than they'd expected when they'd worked for what was in effect 
the Contact section's espionage and dirty tricks department.) 

~ I did not - 

~ Plus I've got a job to do here, Genar-Hofoen interrupted. ~ I've got 
another audience with the Grand Council in a month to tell them to 
be nicer to their neighbours or we're going to think about slapping 
their paddles.  I want details of this exciting new opportunity or you 
can shove it. 

~ I did not say that I am speaking on behalf of Special Circumstances. 

~ Are you denying that you are? 

~ Not as such, but - 

~ So stop fucking around.  Who the hell else is going to start hauling 
a gifted and highly effective ambassador off - ? 

~ Genar-Hofoen, we are wasting time here. 

~ We?, Genar-Hofoen thought, watching the two scratchounds 
launch themselves at each other slowly. ~ Never mind.  Go on. 

~ The task required of you is, apparently, a delicate one, which is 
why I personally regard you as being utterly unsuited to it, and as 
such it would be foolish to entrust the full details either to myself, to 
your module, your suit or indeed to you until all these details are 
required. 

~ There you are; that's exactly what you can shove; all that SC need-
to-know crap.  I don't care how fucking delicate the task is, I'm not 
even going to consider it until I know what's involved. 

The scratchounds were in mid-pounce now, both of them twisting as 
they leapt.  Shit, thought Genar-Hofoen; this might be one of those 
scratchound bouts where the whole thing was decided on the initial 
lunge, depending entirely on which beast got its teeth into the neck 
of the other first. 

~ What is required, said the message, with a fair approximation of 
the way the Death And Gravity had always sounded when it was 
exasperated, is eighty days of your time, ninety-nine to ninety-nine 
point nine-plus percent of which you will spend doing nothing more 
onerous or demanding than being carried from point A to point B; the 
first part of your journey will be spent travelling, in considerable 
comfort, I imagine, aboard the Affronter ship which we will ask (or 
rather pay, probably) them to put at your disposal, the second part 
will be spent in guaranteed comfort aboard a Culture GCU and will be 
followed by a short visit aboard another Culture vessel whereupon 
the task we would ask of you will actually be accomplished - and when 
I say a short visit, I mean that it may be possible for you to carry out 
what is required of you within an hour, and that certainly the 
assignment should take no longer than a day.  Then you will make 
the return journey to take up wherever you left off with our dear 
friends 
and 
allies 
the 
Affront.  I 
take 
it 
all 
that 
doesn't 

sound too much like hard work, does it? 

The scratchounds were meeting in the air a metre above the centre 
of the bait-pit, their jaws aimed as best they could at each other's 

throats.  It was still a little hard to tell, but Genar-Hofoen didn't think 
it was looking too good for Fivetide's animal. 

~ Yeah yeah yeah, well I've heard all this sort of thing before, D and 
G.  What's in it for me?  Why the hell should I-?  Oh, fuck… 

~ What? said the Death And Gravity's message. 

But Genar-Hofoen's attention was elsewhere. 

The two scratchounds met and locked, falling to the floor of the bait-
pit in a tangle of slowly thrashing limbs.  The blue-collared animal 
had its jaws clamped around the throat of the red-collared one.  Most 
of the Affronters were starting to cheer.  Fivetide and his supporters 
were screaming. 

Shit. 

~ Suit?  Genar-Hofoen thought. 

~ What is it? said the gelfield. ~ I thought you were talking to-? 

~ Never mind that now.  See that blue scratchound? 

~ Can't take my or your eyes off the damn thing. 

~ Effectorise the fucker; get it off the other one. 

~ I can't do that!  That would be cheating! 

~ Fivetide's arse is hanging way out the merry-go-round on this, 
suit.  Do it now or take personal responsibility for a major diplomatic 
incident.  Up to you. 

~ What?  But-! 

~ Effectorise it now, suit.  Come on; I know that last upgrade let you 
sneak it under their monitors.  Oh!  Look at that.  Ow!  Can't you 
just feel those prosthetics round your neck?  Fivetide must be kissing 
his diplomatic career goodbye right now; probably already working 

~ All right!  All right!  There! 

There was a buzzing sensation on top of Genar-Hofoen's right 
shoulder.  The red scratchound jerked, the blue one doubled up 
around its midriff and loosened its grip.  The red-collared beast 
wriggled out from underneath the other and, twisting, turned on the 
other beast and immediately reversed the situation, fastening its 
prosthetic jaws around the throat of the blue-collared animal.  At 
Genar-Hofoen's side, still in slow motion, Fivetide was starting to rise 
into the air. 

~ Right, D and G, what were you saying? 

~ What was the delay?  What were you doing? 

~ Never mind.  Like you said, time's a wasting.  Get on with it. 

~ I assume it is reward you seek.  What do you want? 

~ Golly, let me think.  Can I have my own ship? 

~ I understand that to be negotiable. 

~ I'll bet. 

~ You may have whatever you want.  There.  Will that do? 

~ Oh, of course. 

~ Genar-Hofoen, please.  I beg you; say you will do this thing. 

~ D and G, you're begging me?  Genar-Hofoen asked with a laugh in 
his thought, as the blue-collared scratchound writhed hopelessly in 
the other beast's jaws and Fivetide started to turn to him. 

~ Yes, I am!  Now will you agree?  Time is of the essence! 

From the corner of one eye, Genar-Hofoen watched one of Fivetide's 
limbs begin to flip towards him.  He readied his slow-reacting body 
for the blow. 

~ I'll think about it. 

~ But-! 

~ Quit that signal, suit.  Tell the module not to wait up.  Now, suit - 
command instruction: take yourself off-line until I call on you. 

Genar-Hofoen halted the effects of the quicken. He smiled and sighed 
a happy sigh as Fivetide's celebratory blow landed with a teeth-
rattling thud on his back and the Culture lost a thousand 
suckers.  Could be a fun evening. 

IV 

The horror came for the commandant again that night, in the grey 
area that was the half-light from a full moon.  It was worse this time. 

In the dream, he rose from his camp bed in the pale light of 
dawn.  Down the valley, the chimneys above the charnel wagons 
belched dark smoke.  Nothing else in the camp was moving.  He 
walked between the silent tents and under the guard towers to the 
funicular, which took him up through the forests to the glaciers. 

The light was blinding white and the cold, thin air rasped the back of 
his throat.  The wind buffeted him, raising veils of snow and ice that 
shifted across the fractured surface of the great river of ice, contained 
between the jagged banks of the rock-black and snow-white 
mountains. 

The commandant looked around.  They were quarrying the deep 
western face now; it was the first time he had seen this latest 
site.  The face itself lay inside a great bowl they had blasted in the 
glacier; men, machines and drag-lines moved like insects in the 
bottom of the vast cup of shining ice.  The face was pure white except 
for a speckling of black dots which from this distance appeared just 
like boulders.  It looked dangerously steep, he thought, but cutting it 

at a shallower angle would have taken longer, and they were forever 
being hurried along by headquarters… 

At the top of the inclined ramp where the drag lines released their 
hooked cargoes, a train waited, smoke drifting blackly across the 
blindingly white landscape.  Guards stamped their feet, engineers 
stood in animated discussion by the winch engine and a caravan 
shack disgorged another shift of stackers fresh from a break.  A 
sledge full of face-workers was being lowered down the huge gash in 
the ice; he could make out the sullen, pinched faces of the men, 
bundled in uniforms and clothes that were little better than rags. 

There was a rumble, and a vibration beneath his feet. 

He looked round to the ice face again to see the entire eastern half 
of it crumbling away, collapsing and falling with majestic slowness in 
billowing clouds of whiteness onto the tiny black dots of the workers 
and guards below.  He watched the little figures turn and run from 
the rushing avalanche of ice as it pressed down through the air and 
along the surface towards them. 

A few made it.  Most did not, disappearing under the huge white 
wave, rubbed out amongst that chalky, glittering turmoil.  The noise 
was a roar so deep he felt it in his chest. 

He ran along the lip of the face-cut to the top of the inclined plane; 
everybody was shouting and running around.  The entire bottom of 
the bowl was filling with the white mist of the kicked-up snow and 
pulverised ice, obscuring the still-running survivors just as the ice-
fall itself had those it had buried. 

The winch engine laboured, making a high, screeching noise.  The 
drag lines had stopped.  He ran on to the knot of people gathering 
near the inclined plane. 

I know what happens here, he thought. I know what happens to 
me.  I remember the pain.  I see the girl.  I know this bit.  I know 
what happens.  I must stop running.  Why don't I stop running?  Why 
can't I stop?  Why can't I wake up? 

As he got to the others, the strain on the trapped drag line - still being 
pulled by the winch engine - proved too much.  The steel hawser 
parted somewhere down inside the bowl of mist with a noise like a 
shot.  The steel cable came hissing and sizzing up through the air, 
snaking and wriggling as it ripped up the slope towards the lip, loosing 
most of its grisly cargo from its hooks as it came, like drops of ice off 
a whip. 

He screamed to the men at the top of the inclined plane, and tripped, 
falling onto his face in the snow. 

Only one of the engineers dropped in time. 

Most of the rest were cut neatly in half by the scything hawser, falling 
slowly to the snow in bloody sprays.  Loops of the hawser smacked 
off the railway engine with a thunderous clanging noise and wrapped 
themselves around the winch housing as though with relief; other 
coils thumped heavily to the snow. 

Something hit his upper leg with the force of a fully swung 
sledgehammer, breaking his bones in a cataclysm of pain.  The 
impact rolled him over and over in the snow while the bones ground 
and dug and pierced; it went on for what felt like half a day.  He came 
to rest in the snow, screaming.  He was face-to-face with the thing 
that had hit him. 

It was one of the bodies the drag line had flicked off as it tore up the 
slope, another corpse they had hacked and loosened and pulled like 
a rotten tooth from the new face of the glacier that morning, a dead 
witness that it was their duty to discover and remove with all dispatch 
and secrecy to the charnel wagons in the valley below to be turned 
from an accusatory body to innocent smoke and ash.  What had hit 
him and shattered his leg was one of the bodies which had been 
dumped in the glacier half a generation ago, when the enemies of the 
Race had been expunged from the newly conquered territories. 

The scream forced its way out of his lungs like something desperate 
to be born to the freezing air, like something aching to join the 
screams he could hear spread around him near the lip of the inclined 
plane. 

The commandant's breath was gone; he stared into the rock-hard 
face of the body that had hit him and he sobbed for breath to scream 
again.  It was a child's face; a girl's. 

The snow burned his face.  His breath would not come back.  His leg 
was a burning brand of pain lighting up his whole body. 

But not his eyes.  The view began to dim. 

Why is this happening to me?  Why won't it stop?  Why can't I stop 
it?  Why can't I wake up?  What makes me re-live these terrible 
memories? 

Then the pain and the cold went away, seemed to be taken away, 
and another kind of coldness came upon him, and he found himself… 
thinking.  Thinking about all that had happened.  Reviewing, judging 

… In the desert we burned them immediately.  None of this 
sloppiness.  Was it some attempt at poetry, to bury them in the 
glacier?  Interred where they were so far up the ice sheet, their 
bodies would stay in the ice for centuries.  Buried too deep for anyone 
to find without the killing effort we had to put into it.  Did our leaders 
begin to believe their own propaganda, that their rule would last a 
hundred lifetimes, and so started to think that far ahead?  Could they 
see the melt-lakes below the glacier's ragged, dirty skirt, all those 
centuries from now, covered with the floating bodies released from 
the ice's grip?  Did it start to worry them what people would think of 
them then?  Having conquered all the present with such ruthlessness, 
did they embark on a campaign to defeat the future too, make it love 
them as we all pretend to? 

… In the desert we burned them immediately.  They came out in the 
long trains through the burning heat and the choking dust and the 
ones that hadn't died in the black trucks we offered copious water; 
no will could resist the thirst those baking days spent amongst death 
had built up in them. 

They drank the poisoned water and died within hours.  We incinerated 
the plundered bodies in solar furnaces, our offering to the insatiable 
sky gods of Race and Purity.  And there seemed to be something pure 

about the way they were disposed of, as though their deaths gave 
them a nobility they could never have achieved in their mean, 
degraded lives.  Their ashes fell like a lighter dust on the powderous 
emptiness of the desert, to be blown away together in the first storm. 

The last furnace loads were the camp workers - gassed in their 
dormitories, mostly - and all the paperwork: every letter, every order, 
every requisition pad, stores sheet, file, note and memo.  We were 
all searched, even I.  Those the special police found hiding diaries 
were shot on the spot.  Most of our effects went up in smoke, 
too.  What we were allowed to keep had been searched so thoroughly 
we joked they had managed to remove each grain of sand from our 
uniforms, something the laundry had never been able to do. 

We were split up and moved to different posts throughout the 
conquered territories.  Reunions were not encouraged. 

I thought of writing down what had happened - not to confess but to 
explain. 

And we suffered, too.  Not just in the physical conditions, though 
those were bad enough, but in our minds, in our consciences.  There 
may have been a few brutes, a few monsters who gloried in it all 
(perhaps we kept a few murderers off the streets of our cities for all 
that time), but most of us went through intermittent agonies, 
wondering in moments of crisis if what we were doing was really right, 
even though in our hearts we knew it was. 

So many of us had nightmares.  The things we saw each day, the 
scenes we witnessed, the pain and terror; these things could not help 
but affect us. 

Those we disposed of; their torment lasted a few days, maybe a 
month or two, then it was over as quickly and efficiently as we could 
make the process. 

Our suffering has gone on for a generation. 

I am proud of what I did.  I wish it had not fallen to me to do what 
bad to be done, but I am glad that I did it to the best of my 
capabilities, and I would do it again. 

That was why I wanted to write down what had happened; to witness 
our belief and our dedication and our suffering. 

I never did. 

I am proud of that too. 

He was back in reality, back in the present, back in the bedroom of 
his house in the retirement complex, near the sea; he could see the 
sunlight hitting the tiles of the balcony outside the room.  His twinned 
hearts thumped, the scales had risen on his back, prickling him.  His 
leg ached, echoing with the pain of that ancient injury on the glacier. 

The dream had been the most vivid yet, and the longest, finally taking 
him to the ice-fall in the western face and the accident with the drag 
line (deep buried, that had been, in his memory, submerged beneath 
all the dread white weight of his remembered pain).  As well as that, 
whatever he had experienced had gone beyond the normal course, 
the usual environment of dreams, propelled there by the reliving of 
the accident and the image of fighting for breath while he stared 
transfixed into the face of the dead girl. 

He had found himself thinking, explaining, even justifying what he 
had done in his army career, in the most definitive part of his life. 

And now he could feel something inside his head. 

Whatever it was inside his head got him to close his eyes. 

~ At last, it said.  It was a deep, deliberately authoritative voice, its 
pronunciation almost too perfect. 

At last? he thought. (What was this?) 

~ I have the truth. 

What truth? (Who was this?) 

~ Of what you did.  Your people. 

What? 

~ The evidence was everywhere; across the desert, caked in loam, 
lodged in plants, sunk to the bottom of lakes, and there in the cultural 
record too; the sudden vanishings of art works, changes in 
architecture and agriculture.  There were a few hidden records - 
books, photographs, sound recordings, indices, which contradicted 
the re-written histories - but they still didn't directly explain why so 
many people, so many peoples seemed to vanish so suddenly, 
without any sign of assimilation. 

What are you talking about? (What was this in his head?) 

~ You would not believe what I am, commandant, but what I am 
talking about is a thing called genocide, and the proof thereof. 

We did what had to be done! 

~ Thank you, we've just been through all that.  Your self-
justifications have been noted. 

I believed in what I did! 

~ I know.  You had the residual decency to question it occasionεally, 
but in the end you did indeed believe in what you were doing.  That 
is not an excuse, but it is a point. 

Who are you?  What gives you the right to crawl inside my brains? 

~ 
My 
name 
would 
be 
something 
like Grey 
Area in 
your 

language.  What gives me the right to crawl inside your brains, as 
you put it, is the same thing that gave you the right to do what you 
did to those you murdered; power.  Superior power. Vastly superior 

power, in my case.  However, I have been called away and I have to 
leave you now, but I shall return in a few months and I'll be continuing 
my investigations then.  There are still enough of you left to construct 
a more… triangulated case. 

What? he thought, trying to open his eyes. 

~ Commandant, there is nothing worse I can wish upon you than to 
be what you already are, but you might care to reflect upon this while 
I'm gone: 

Instantly, he was back in the dream. 

He fell through the bed, the single ice-white sheet tore beneath him 
and tumbled him into a bottomless tank of blood; he fell down 
through it to light, and the desert, and the rail line through the sands; 
he fell into one of the trains, into one of the trucks and was there with 
his broken leg amongst the stinking dead and the moaning living, 
jammed in between the excrement-covered bodies with the weeping 
sores and the buzz of the flies and the white-hot rage of the thirst 
inside him. 

He died in the cattle truck, after an infinity of agony.  There was time 
for the briefest of glimpses of his room in the retirement 
complex.  Even in his still-shocked, pain-maddened state he had the 
time and the presence of mind to think that while it felt as though a 
day at least must have passed while he had been submerged in the 
torture-dream nevertheless everything in the bedroom looked just as 
it had earlier.  Then he was dragged under again. 

He awoke entombed inside the glacier, dying of cold.  He had been 
shot in the head but it had only paralysed him.  Another endless 
agony. 

He had a second impression of the retirement home; still the sunlight 
was at the same angle.  He had not imagined it was possible to feel 
so much pain, not in such a time, not in a life-time, not in a hundred 
lifetimes.  He found there was just time to flex his body and move a 
finger's width across the bed before the dream resumed. 

Then he was in the hold of a ship, crammed in with thousands of 
other people in the darkness, surrounded again by stink and filth and 
screams and pain.  He was already half dead two days later when the 
sea valves opened and those still left alive began to drown. 

The expression on his face was such that the retirement-home 
warden almost fainted and had to sit down quickly, but the doctor 
declared the end had probably been quick.

VI 

He left a trail of weaponry and the liquefied remains of gambling 
chips.  The two heavy micro rifles clattered to the absorber mat just 
outside the airlock door and the cloak fell just beyond them.  The 

guns glinted in the soft light reflecting off gleaming wooden 
panels.  The mercury gambling chips in his jacket pocket, exposed to 
the human-ambient heat of the module's interior, promptly 
melted.  He felt the change happen, and stopped, mystified, to stare 
into his pockets.  He shrugged, then turned his pockets inside out and 
let the mercury splash onto the mat.  He yawned and walked 
on.  Funny the module hadn't greeted him. 

The pistols bounced on the carpeted floor of the hall and lay beading 
with frost.  He left the short jacket hanging on a piece of sculpture in 
the hall.  He yawned again.  It was not far off the time of habitat 
dawn.  Very much time for bed.  He rolled down the tops of the knee-
boots and kicked them both down the corridor leading to the 
swimming pool. 

He was pulling down his trousers as he entered the module's main 
social area, shuffling forward bent over and holding on to the wall as 
he cursed the garments and tried to kick them off without falling over. 

There was somebody there.  He stopped and stared. 

It looked very much like his favourite uncle was sitting in one of the 
lounge's best seats. 

Genar-Hofoen stood upright and swayed, staring through numerous 
blinks. 

'Uncle Tishlin?' he said, squinting at the apparition.  He leant on an 
antique cabinet and finally hauled his trousers off. 

The figure - tall, white-maned and with a light smile playing on its 
craggily severe face - stood up and adjusted its long formal jacket. 
'Just a pretend version, Byr,' the voice rumbled.  The hologram put 
its head back and fixed him with a measuring, questioning look. 'They 
really do want you to do this thing for them, boy.' 

Genar-Hofoen scratched his head and muttered something to the 
suit.  It began to peel off around him. 

'Will you tell me what the hell it actually is, Uncle?' he asked, stepping 
out of the gelfield and taking a deep breath of module air, more to 
annoy the suit than because the air tasted better.  The suit gathered 
itself up into a head-sized ball and floated wordlessly away to clean 
itself. 

The hologram of his uncle breathed out slowly and crossed its arms 
in a way Genar-Hofoen remembered from his early childhood. 

'Put simply, Byr,' the image said, 'they want you to steal the soul of 
a dead woman.' 

Genar-Hofoen stood there, quite naked, still swaying, still blinking. 

'Oh,' he said, after a while. 

2. Not Invented Here 

Hup!… and here we are, waking up.  Quick scan around, nothing 
immediately threatening, it would seem… Hmm.  Floating in 
space.  Odd.  Nobody else around.  That's funny.  View's a bit 
degraded.  Oh-oh, that's a bad sign.  Don't feel quite right, 
either.  Stuff missing here… Clock running way slow, like it's down 
amongst the electronics crap… Run full system check. 

…  Oh, good grief! 

The drone drifted through the darkness of interstellar space.  It really 
was alone.  Profoundly, even frighteningly alone.  It picked through 
the debris that had been its power, sensory and weapon systems, 
appalled at the wasteland it was discovering within itself.  The drone 
felt weird.  It knew who it was - it was Sisela Ytheleus 1/2, a type D4 
military drone of the Explorer Ship Peace Makes Plenty, a vessel of 
the Stargazer Clan, part of the Fifth Fleet of the Zetetic Flench - but 
its real-time memories only began from the instant it had woken up 
here, a zillion klicks from anywhere, slap bang in the middle of 
nothing with the shit kicked out of it.  What a mess!  Who had done 
this?  What had happened to it?  Where were its memories?  Where 
was its mind-state? 

Actually it suspected it knew.  It was functioning on the middle level 
of its five stepped mind-modes; the electronic. 

Below lay an atomechanical complex and beneath that a 
bioεchemical brain.  In theory the routes to both lay open; in 
practice both were compromised.  The atomechanical mind wasn't 
respondεing correctly to the system-state signals it was receiving, 
and the biochemical brain was simply a mush; either the drone had 
been doing some hard manoeuvring recently or it had been clobbered 
by something.  It felt like dumping the whole biochemical unit into 
space now but it knew the cellular soup its final back-up mind-
substrate had turned into might come in handy for something. 

Above, where it ought to be right now, there were a couple of 
enormously wide conduits leading to the photonic nucleus and beyond 
that 
the 
true 
AI 
core.  Both 
completely 
blocked 
off, 
and 

metaphorically plastered with warning signals.  The equivalent of a 
single lit tell-tale adjacent to the photonic pipe indicated there was 
activity of some sort in there.  The AI core was either dead, empty or 
just not saying. 

The drone ran another systems-control check.  It seemed to be in 
charge of the whole outfit, what was left of it.  It wondered if the 
sensor and weaponry systems degradation was real.  Perhaps it was 
an illusion; perhaps those units were in fact in perfect working order 
and under the control of one or both of the higher mind 
components.  It dug deeper into the units' programming.  No, it 
didn't look possible. 

Unless the whole situation was a simulation.  That was possible.  A 
test: what would you do if you suddenly found yourself drifting alone 
in interstellar space, almost every system severely damaged, reduced 
to a level-three mind-state with no sign of help anywhere and no 
recollection 
how 
you 
got 
here 
or 
what 
happened 
to 

you?  It sounded like a particularly nasty simulation problem; a 
nearly-worst-case scenario dreamt up by a Drone Training and 
Selection Board. 

Well, there was no way of telling, and it had to act as though it was 
all real. 

It kept looking around inside its own mind-state. Ah ha. 

There were a couple of closed sub-cores intact within its electronic 
mind, sealed and labelled as potentially - though not probably - 
dangerous.  There was a similar warning attached to the self-repair 
control-routine matrices.  The drone let those be for the moment.  It 
would check out everything else that it could before it started opening 
packages with what might prove to be nasty surprises inside. 

Where the hell was it?  It scanned the stars.  A matrix of figures 
flashed into its consciousness.  Definitely the middle of nowhere.  The 
general volume was called the Upper Leaf-Swirl by most people; 
forty-five kilolights from galactic centre.  The nearest star - fourteen 
standard light months away - was called Esperi, an old red giant which 
had long since swallowed up its complement of inner planets and 
whose insubstantial orb of gases now glowed dully upon a couple of 
distant, icy worlds and a distant cloud of comet nuclei.  No life 
anywhere; just another boring, barren system like a hundred million 
others. 

The general volume was one of the less well-visited and relatively 
uninhabited regions of the galaxy.  Nearest major civilisation point; 
the Sagraeth system, forty light years away, with a stage-three 
lizardoid civilisation first contacted by the Culture a decade 
ago.  Nothing special there.  Voluminal influences/interests rated 
Creheesil 15%, Affront 10%, Culture 5% (the normal claimed 
minimum, the Culture's influence/interest equivalent of backεground 
radiation), and a smattering of investigations and flybys by twenty 
other civilisations making up a nominal 2%; otherwise not a place 
anybody was really interested in; a two-thirds forgotten, disregarded 
region of space.  Never before directly investigated by the Elench, 
though there had been the usual deep-space remote scans from afar, 
showing nothing special.  No clues there. 

Date; n4.28.803, by the chronology the Elench still shared with the 
Culture.  The drone's service log abstract recorded that it had been 
built as part of a matched pair by the Peace Makes Plenty in n4.13, 
shortly after the ship's own construction had been completed.  Most 
recent entry; '28.725.500: ship leaving Tier habitat for a standard 
sweep-search of the outer reaches of the Upper Leaf-Swirl.  The 

detailed service log was missing.  The last flagged event the drone 
could find in its library dated from '28.802; a daily current affairs 
archive update.  So had that been just yesterday, or could something 
have happened to its clock? 

It scrutinised its damage reports and searched its memories.  The 
damage profile equated to that caused by plasma fire, and - from the 
lack of obvious patterning - either an enormous plasma event very 
far away or plasma fire - possibly fusion-sourced - much closer but 
buffered in some way.  A nearby plasma implosure was the most 
obvious example.  Not something it could do itself.  The ship could, 
though. 

Its X-ray laser had been fired recently and its field-shields projectors 
had soaked up some leak-through damage.  Consistent with what 
would have happened if something just like itself had attacked 
it. Hmm. One of a matched pair. 

It thought.  It searched.  It could find no further mention of its twin. 

It looked about itself, gauging its drift, and searching. 

It was drifting at about two-eighty klicks a second, almost directly 
away from the Esperi system.  In front of it - it focused all its 
damaged sensory capacity to peer ahead - nothing; it didn't appear 
to be aimed at anything. 

Two-eighty klicks a second; that was somewhere just underneath the 
theoretical limit beyond which something of its mass would start to 
produce a relativistic trace on the surface of space-time, if one had 
perfect instrumentation.  Now, was that a coincidence, or not?  If not, 
it might have been slung out of the ship for some reason; Displaced, 
perhaps.  It concentrated its senses backwards.  No obvious point of 
origin, and nothing coming after it, either.  Hint of something though. 

The drone refocused, cursing its hopelessly degraded senses.  Behind 
it, it found… gas, plasma, carbon.  It widened the cone of its focus. 

What it had discovered was an inflating shell of debris, drifting after 
it at a tenth of its speed.  It ran a rewind of the debris shell's 

expansion; it originated at a point forty klicks behind the position 
where it had first woken up, eighteen fifty-three milliseconds ago. 

Which implied it had been drifting totally unconscious for nearly half 
a second. Scary. 

It scanned the distant shell of expanding particles.  They'd been 
hot.  Messy.  That was wreckage.  Battle wreckage, even.  The 
carbon and the ions could originally have been part of itself, or part 
of the ship, or even part of a human.  A few molecules of nitrogen 
and carbon dioxide.  No oxygen. 

But all of it doing just 10% of its own velocity.  Odd, that.  As though 
it had somehow been prioritised out of a sudden appearance of 
matter.  Again, as though it had been Displaced, perhaps. 

The drone flicked part of its attention back inside, to the sealed cores 
in its mind substrate with their warning notices.  Can't put this off 
any longer, I suppose, it thought. 

It interrogated the two cores.  PAST, the first was labelled.  The other 
one was simply called 2/2. 

Uh-huh, it thought. 

It opened the first core and found its memories. 

II 

Genar-Hofoen floated within the shower, buffeted from all sides by 
the streams of water.  The fans sucking the water back out of the AG 
shower chamber sounded awfully loud this morning.  Part of his brain 
told him he was running short of oxygen; he'd either have to leave 
the shower or grope for the air hose which was probably in the last 
place he'd feel for it.  It was either that or open his eyes.  It all 
seemed too much bother.  He was quite comfortable where he was. 

He waited to see what would give first. 

It 
was 
his 
brain's 
indifference 
to 
the 
fact 
he 
was 

suffocating.  Suddenly he was wide awake and flailing around like 

some drowning basic-human, desperate for breath but afraid to 
breathe in the constellation of water globules he was floating 
within.  His eyes were wide open.  He saw the air hose and grabbed 
it.  He breathed in.  Shit it was bright.  His eyes dimmed the 
view.  That was better. 

He felt he'd showered enough.  He mumbled, 'Off, off,' into the air 
hose mask a few times, but the water kept on coming.  Then he 
remembered that the module wasn't talking to him right now because 
he'd told the suit to accept no more communications last 
night.  Obviously such irresponsibility had to be punished by the 
module being childish.  He sighed. 

Luckily the shower had an Off button.  The water jets cut off.  Gravity 
was fed gently back into the chamber and he floated slowly down with 
the settling blobs of water.  A reverser field clicked on and he looked 
at himself in it while the last of the water drained away, sucking in 
his belly and sticking out his chin while he turned his face to the best 
angle and smoothed down a few upstart locks of his blond curls. 

'Well, I may feel like shit but I still look great,' he announced to 
nobody in particular.  For once, probably even the module wasn't 
listening. 

''s all right,' he said through a mouthful of feyl steak.  He washed it 
down with some warmed-over infusion the module had always 
assured him was beneficial when you hadn't had enough sleep.  It 
tasted disgusting enough to be either genuinely good for you, or just 
one of the module's little jokes. 

'Sleep okay?' his uncle's image asked.  He was, apparently, sitting 
across the table from Genar-Hofoen in the module's dining room, a 
pleasantly airy space filled with porcelain and flowers and boasting a 
seemingly real-time view on three sides of a sunlit mountain valley, 

which in reality was half a galaxy away.  A small serving drone 
hovered near the wall behind the man. 

'Good two hours,' Genar-Hofoen said.  He supposed he could have 
stayed awake the night before when he'd first discovered his uncle's 
hologram waiting for him; he could have glanded something to keep 
him bright and awake and receptive and got all this over with then, 
but he'd known he'd end up paying for it eventually and besides, he 
wanted to show them that just because they'd gone to the trouble of 
persuading his favourite uncle to record a semantic-signal-mind-
abstract-state or whatever the hell the module had called it, he still 
wasn't going to jump just because they said so.  The only concession 
he'd made to all the urgency was deliberately not to dream; he had 
a whole suite of pretty splendid dream-accessible scenarios going at 
the moment, several of them incorporating some powerfully good and 
satisfying sex, and it was a positive sacrifice to miss out on any of 
them. 

So he'd gone to bed and had a pretty good if maybe still not quite 
long enough sleep and Uncle Tishlin's message had just had to sit 
twiddling its abstract semantics in the module's AI core, waiting till 
he got up. 

So far all they'd done was exchange a few pleasantries and talk a 
little about old times; partly, of course, so that Genar-Hofoen could 
satisfy himself that this apparition had genuinely been sent by his 
uncle and SC had paid him the enormous compliment of sending not 
one but two personality-states to him in order to argue him round to 
doing whatever it was they wanted from him (that the hologram 
might be a brilliantly researched forgery created by SC would be even 
more of a compliment… but that way lay paranoia). 

'I take it you had a good evening,' Tishlin's simulation said. 

'Enormous fun.' 

Tishlin looked puzzled.  Genar-Hofoen watched the expression form 
on his uncle's face and wondered how comprehensive was the 
duplication of his uncle's personality now encoded - living, if you 
wanted to look at it that way - in the module's AI core.  Did whatever 

was in there - sent here enciphered with the specific task of 
persuading him to cooperate with Special Circumstances -
actually feel?  Or did it just appear to? 

Shit, I must be feeling bad, Genar-Hofoen thought.  I haven't 
bothered about that sort of shit since university. 

'How can you have enormous fun with… aliens?' the hologram asked, 
eyebrows gathering. 

'Attitude,' Genar-Hofoen said cryptically, slicing off more steak. 

'But you can't drink with them, eat with them, can't really touch them, 
or want the same things…' Tishlin said, still frowning. 

Genar-Hofoen shrugged. 'It's a kind of translation,' he said. 'You get 
used to it.' He munched away for a moment while his uncle's program 
- or whatever it was - digested this.  He pointed his knife at the 
image. 'That's something I'd want, in the unlikely event I agree to do 
whatever it is they want me to do.' 

'What?' Tishlin said, leaning back, arms crossed. 

'I want to become an Affronter.' 

Tishlin's eyebrows elevated. 'You want what, boy?' he said. 

'Well, some of the time,' Genar-Hofoen said, half turning his head to 
the drone behind him; the machine came quickly forward and refilled 
his glass with the infusion. 'I mean, all I want is an Affronter body, 
one that I can just sort of zap into and… well, just be an 
Affronter.  You know; socialise.  I don't see what the problem is, 
really.  In fact I keep telling them it'll be a great thing for Culture-
Affront relations.  I'd really be able to relate to these guys; I could 
really be one of them.  Hell; isn't that what this ambassador shit is 
supposed to be all about?' He belched. 'I'm sure it could be done.  The 
module says it could but it shouldn't and says it's asked elsewhere 
and I know all the standard objections, but I think it'd be a great 
idea.  I'm damn sure I'd enjoy it, I mean I could always sort of zap 

The image shook its head. 'You always were the oddest child, Byr.  I 
suppose I should have known what to expect from you.  Anybody 
who'd go out there to live with the Affront in the first place has to be 
slightly strange.' 

Genar-Hofoen held his arms out wide. 'But I'm just doing what you 
did!' he protested. 

'I only wanted to meet weird aliens, Byr; I didn't want to become one 
of them.' 

'Heck, and I thought you'd be proud of me.' 

'Proud but worried.  Byr, are you seriously suggesting that becoming 
an Affronter would be part of your price for doing what SC asks?' 

'Certainly,' Genar-Hofoen said, and squinted up at the hammer-
beamed ceiling. 'I vaguely recall asking for a ship as well last night 
and the Death And Gravity saying yes…' he shook his head and 
laughed. 'Must have imagined it.' He finished the last of the steak. 

'They've told me what they're prepared to offer, Byr,' Tishlin said. 
'You didn't imagine it.' 

Genar-Hofoen looked up. 'Really?' he asked. 

'Really,' Tishlin said. 

Genar-Hofoen nodded slowly. 'And how did they persuade you to act 
as go-between, Uncle?' he asked. 

'They only had to ask, Byr.  I may not be in Contact any more but I'm 
happy to help out when I can, when they have a problem.' 

'This isn't Contact, Uncle, this is Special Circumstances,' Byr said 
quietly. 'They tend to play by slightly different rules.' 

Tishlin looked serious; the image sounded defensive. 'I know that, 
boy.  I asked around some of my contacts before I agreed to do this; 
everything checks out, everything seems to be… reliable.  I suggest 
you do the same, obviously, but from what I can see, what I've been 
told is the truth.' 

Genar-Hofoen was silent for a moment. 'Okay.  So what have they 
told you, Uncle?' he asked, draining the last of the infusion.  He 
frowned, wiped his lips and inspected the napkin.  He looked at the 
sediment in the bottom of the glass, then glared at the servant 
drone.  It wobbled in the drone equivalent of a shrug and took the 
glass from his hand. 

Tishlin's representation sat forward, putting its arms on the table. 'Let 
me tell you a story, Byr.' 

'By all means,' Genar-Hofoen said, picking something from his lips 
and wiping it on the napkin.  The serving drone started to remove the 
rest of the breakfast things. 

'Long ago and far away - two and a half thousand years ago,' Tishlin 
said, 'in a wispy tendril of suns outside the Galactic plane, nearest to 
Asatiel Cluster, but not really near to that or anywhere else - 
the Problem Child, an early General Contact Unit, Troubadour Class, 
chanced upon the ember of a very old star.  The GCU started to 
investigate.  And it found not one but two unusual things.' 

Genar-Hofoen drew his gown about him and settled back in his seat, 
a small smile on his lips.  Uncle Tish had always liked telling 
stories.  Some of Genar-Hofoen's earliest memories were of the long, 
sunlit kitchen of the house at Ois, back on Seddun Orbital; his 
mother, the other adults of the house and his various cousins would 
all be milling around, chattering and laughing while he sat on his 
uncle's knee, being told tales.  Some of them were ordinary children's 
stories - which he'd heard before, often, but which always sounded 
better when Uncle Tish told them - and some of them his uncle's own 
stories, from when he'd been in Contact, travelling the galaxy in a 
succession of ships, exploring strange new worlds and meeting all 
sorts of odd folk and finding any number of weird and wonderful 
things amongst the stars. 

'Firstly,' the hologram image said, 'the dead sun gave every sign of 
being absurdly ancient.  The techniques used to date it indicated it 
was getting on for a trillion years old.' 

'What?' Genar-Hofoen snorted. 

Uncle Tishlin spread his hands. 'The ship couldn't believe it either.  To 
come up with this unlikely figure, it used…' the apparition glanced 
away to one side, the way Tishlin always had when he was thinking, 
and Genar-Hofoen found himself smiling, '… isotopic analysis and 
flux-pitting assay.' 

'Technical terms,' Genar-Hofoen said, nodding.  He and the hologram 
both smiled. 

'Technical terms,' the image of Tishlin agreed. 'But no matter what it 
was they used or how they did their sums, it always came out that 
the dead star was at least fifty times older than the universe.' 

'I never heard that one before,' Genar-Hofoen said, shaking his head 
and looking thoughtful. 

'Me neither,' Tishlin agreed. 'Though as it turns out it was released 
publicly, just not until long after it had all happened.  One reason 
there was no big fuss at the time was that the ship was so 
embarrassed about what it was coming up with it never filed a full 
report, just kept the results to itself, in its own mind.' 

'Did they have proper Minds back then?' 

Tishlin's image shrugged. 'Mind with a small "m"; AI core, we'd 
probably call it these days.  But it was certainly sentient and the point 
is that the information remained in the ship's head, as it were.' 

Where, of course, it would remain the ship's.  Practically the only 
form of private property the Culture recognised was thought, and 
memory.  Any publicly filed report or analysis was theoretically 
available 
to 
anybody, 
but 
your 
own 
thoughts, 
your 
own 

recolεlections - whether you were a human, a drone or a ship Mind 
- were regarded as private.  It was considered the ultimate in bad 

manners even to think about trying to read somebody else's - or 
something else's - mind. 

Personally, Genar-Hofoen had always thought it was a reasonεable 
enough rule, although along with a lot of people over the years he'd 
long suspected that one of the main reasons for its existence was that 
it suited the purposes of the Culture's Minds in general, and those in 
Special Circumstances in particular. 

Thanks to that taboo, everybody in the Culture could keep secrets to 
themselves and hatch little schemes and plots to their hearts' 
content.  The trouble was that while in humans this sort of behaviour 
tended to manifest itself in practical jokes, petty jealousies, silly 
misunderstandings and instances of tragically unrequited love, with 
Minds it occasionally meant they forgot to tell everybody else about 
finding entire stellar civilisations, or took it upon themselves to try to 
alter the course of a developed culture everybody already did know 
about (with the almost unspeakable implication that one day they 
might do just that not with a culture but with the Culture… always 
assuming they hadn't done so already, of course). 

'What about the people on board the Culture ship?' Genar-Hofoen 
asked. 

'They knew as well, of course, but they kept quiet, too.  Apart from 
anything else, they had two weirdnesses on their hands; they 
assumed they had to be linked in some way but they couldn't work 
out how, so they decided to wait and see before they told everybody 
else.' Tishlin shrugged. 'Understandable, I suppose; it was all so 
outlandish I suppose anybody would think twice about shouting it to 
the rooftops.  You couldn't get away with such reticence these days, 
but this was then; the guidelines were looser.' 

'What was the other unusual thing they found?' 

'An artifact,' Tishlin said, sitting back in the seat. 'A perfect black-
body sphere fifty klicks across, in orbit around the unfeasibly ancient 
star.  The ship was completely unable to penetrate the artifact with 
its sensors, or with anything else for that matter, and the thing itself 
showed 
no 
signs 
of 
life.  Shortly 
thereafter 
the Problem 

Child developed an engine fault - something almost unheard of, even 
back then - and had to leave the star and the artifact.  Naturally, it 
left a load of satellites and sensor platforms behind it to monitor the 
artifact; all it had arrived with, in fact, plus a load more it had made 
while it was there. 

'However, when a follow-up expedition arrived three years later - 
remember, this all happened on the galactic outskirts, and speeds 
were much lower then - it found nothing; no star, no artifact, and 
none of the sensors and remote packages the Problem Child had left 
behind; the outgoing signals apparently coming from the sentry units 
stopped just before the follow-up expedition arrived within 
monitoring range.  Ripples in the gravity field near by implied the star 
and presumably everything else had vanished utterly the moment 
the Problem Child had been safely out of sensor range.' 

'Just vanished?' 

'Just vanished.  Disappeared without trace,' Tishlin confirmed. 'Most 
damnable thing, too; nobody's ever just lost a sun before, even if it 
was a dead one. 

'In the meantime, the General Systems Vehicle which the Problem 
Child had rendezvoused with for repairs had reported that the GCU 
had effectively been attacked; its engine problem wasn't the result of 
chance or some manufacturing flaw, it was the result of offensive 
action. 

'Apart from that, and the still unexplained disappearance of an entire 
star, everything was normal for nearly two decades.' Tishlin's hand 
flapped once on the table. 'Oh, there were various investigations and 
boards of inquiry and committees and so on, but the best they could 
come up with was that the whole thing had been some sort of hi-tech 
projection, maybe produced by some previously unknown Elder 
civilisation with a quirky sense of humour, or, even less likely, that 
the sun and all the rest had popped into Hyperspace and just sped 
off - though they should have been able to observe that, and hadn't 
- but basically the whole thing remained a mystery, and after 
everybody had chewed it over and over till there was nothing but spit 
left, it just kind of died a natural death. 

'Then, over the following seven decades, the Problem Child decided 
it didn't want to be part of Contact any more.  It left Conεtact, then 
it left the Culture proper and joined the Ulterior - again, very unusual 
for its class - and meanwhile every single human who'd been on board 
at the time exercised what are apparently termed Unusual Life 
Choices.' Tishlin's dubious look indicated he wasn't totally convinced 
this phrase contributed enormously to the information-carrying 
capacity of the language.  The image made a throat-clearing noise 
and went on: 'Roughly half of the humans opted for immortality, the 
other half autoeuthenised.  The few remaining humans underwent 
subtle but exhaustive investigation, though nothing unusual was ever 
discovered. 

'Then there were the ship's drones; they all joined the same Group 
Mind - again in the Ulterior - and have been incommuεnicado ever 
since.  Apparently that was even more unusual.  Within, a century, 
almost all of those humans who'd opted for immortality were also 
dead, due to further "semi-contradictory" Unusual Life Choices.  Then 
the Ulterior, and Special Circumstances - who'd taken an interest by 
this 
time, 
not 
surprisingly 
- 
lost 
touch 
with 
the Problem 

Child entirely.  It just seemed to disappear, too.' The apparition 
shrugged. 'That was fifteen hundred years ago, Byr.  To this day 
nobody has seen or heard of the ship.  Subsequent investigations of 
the remains of a few of the humans concerned, using improved 
technology, 
has 
thrown 
up 
possible 
discrepancies 
in 
the 

nanostructure of the subjects' brains, but no further investigation has 
been deemed possible.  The story was made public eventually, nearly 
a century and a half after it all happened; there was even a bit of a 
media fuss about it at the time, but by then it was a portrait with 
nobody in it: the ship, the drones, the people; they'd all gone.  There 
was nobody to talk to, nobody to interview, nothing to do profiles 
of.  Everybody was off-stage.  And of course the principal celebrities 
- the star and the artifact - were the most off-stage of all.' 

'Well,' Genar-Hofoen said. 'All very-' 

'Hold on,' Tishlin said, holding up one finger. 'There is one loose 
end.  A single traceable survivor from the Problem Child who turned 
up five centuries ago; somebody it might be possible to talk to, 

despite the fact they've spent the last twenty-four millennia trying to 
avoid talking.' 

'Human?' 

'Human,' Tishlin confirmed, nodding. 'The woman who was the 
vessel's formal captain.' 

'They still had that sort of thing back then?' Genar-Hofoen said.  He 
smiled.  How quaint, he thought. 

'It was pretty nominal, even back then,' Tishlin conceded. 'More 
captain of the crew than of the boat.  Anyway; she's still around in a 
sort of abbreviated form.' Tishlin's image paused, watching Genar-
Hofoen closely. 'She's in Storage aboard the General Sysεtems 
Vehicle Sleeper Service.' 

The representation paused, to let Genar-Hofoen react to the name of 
the ship.  He didn't, not on the outside anyway. 

'Just her personality is in there, unfortunately,' Tishlin conεtinued. 
'Her Stored body was destroyed in an Idiran attack on the Orbital 
concerned half a millennium ago.  I suppose for our purposes that 
counts as a lucky break; she'd managed to cover her tracks so well - 
probably with the help of some sympathetic Mind - that if the attack 
hadn't occurred she'd have remained incognito to this day.  It was 
only when the records were scrutinised carefully after her body's 
destruction that it was realised who she really was.  But the point is 
that Special Circumstances thinks she might know something about 
the artifact.  In fact, they're sure she does, though it's almost equally 
certain that she doesn't know what she knows.' 

Genar-Hofoen was silent for a while, playing with the cord of his 
dressing gown.  The Sleeper Service. He hadn't heard that name for 
a while, hadn't had to think about that old machine for a long 
time.  He'd dreamt about it a few times, had had a nightmare or two 
about it even, but he'd tried to forget about those, tried to shove 
those echoes of memories to some distant corner of his mind and 
been pretty successful at it too, because it felt very strange to be 
turning over that name in his mind now. 

'So why's this all suddenly become important after two and a half 
millennia?' he asked the hologram. 

'Because something with similar characteristics to that artifact has 
turned up near a star called Esperi, in the Upper Leaf-Swirl, and SC 
needs all the help it can get to deal with it.  There's no trillion-year-
old sun-cinder this time, but an apparently identical artifact is just 
sitting there.' 

'And what am I supposed to do?' 

'Go aboard the Sleeper Service and talk to this woman's Mimage - 
that's the Mind-stored construct of her personality apparently…' The 
image looked puzzled. '… New one on me… Anyway, you're supposed 
to try to persuade her to be reborn; talk her into a rebirth so she can 
be quizzed.  The Sleeper Service won't just release her, and it 
certainly won't cooperate with SC, but if she asks to be reborn, it'll 
let her.' 

'But why-?' Genar-Hofoen started to ask. 

'There's more,' Tishlin said, holding up one hand. 'Even if she won't 
play, even if she refuses to come back, you're to be equipped with a 
method of retrieving her through the link you'll forge when you talk 
to the Mimage, without the GSV knowing.  Don't ask me how that's 
supposed to be accomplished, but I think it's got something to do 
with the ship they're going to give you to get you to the Sleeper 
Service, after the Affronter ship they're going to hire for you has 
rendezvoused with it at Tier.' 

Genar-Hofoen did his best to look sceptical. 'Is that possible?', he 
asked. 'Retrieving her like that, I mean.  Against the wishes of 
the Sleeper.' 

'Apparently,' Tishlin said, shrugging. 'SC thinks they've got a way of 
doing it.  But you see what I mean when I said they want you to steal 
the soul of a dead woman…' 

Genar-Hofoen thought for a moment. 'Do you know what ship this 
might be?  The one to get me to the Sleeper?' 

'They haven't-' began the image, then paused and looked amused. 
'They just told me; it's a GCU called the Grey Area.' The image 
smiled. 'Ah; I see you've heard of it, too.' 

'Yeah, I've heard of it,' the man said. 

The Grey Area. The ship that did what the other ships both deplored 
and despised; actually looked into the minds of other people, using 
its Electro Magnetic Effectors - in a sense the very, very distant 
descendants of electronic countermeasures equipment from your 
average stage three civilisation, and the most sophisεticated, 
powerful but also precisely controllable weaponry the average Culture 
ship possessed - to burrow into the grisly cellular substrate of an 
animal consciousness and try to make sense of what it found there 
for its own - usually vengeful - purposes.  A pariah craft; the one the 
other Minds called Meatfucker because of its revolting hobby (though 
not, as it were, to its face).  A ship that still wanted to be part of the 
Culture proper and nominally still was, but which was shunned by 
almost all its peers; a virtual outcast amongst the great inclusionary 
meta-fleet that was Contact. 

Genar-Hofoen had heard about the Grey Area all right.  It was 
starting to make sense now.  If there was one vessel that might be 
capable of plundering - and, more importantly, that might be willing 
to plunder - a Stored soul from under the nose of the Sleeper, 
the Grey Area was probably it.  Assuming what he'd heard about the 
ship was true, it had spent the last decade perfecting its techniques 
of teasing dreams and memories out of a variety of animal species, 
while the Sleeper Service had by all accounts been technologically 
stagnant for the last forty years, its time taken up with the indulgence 
of its own scarcely less eccentric pastime. 

The image of Uncle Tishlin bore a distant expression for a moment, 
then said, 'Apparently that's part of the beauty of it; just because 
the Sleeper Service is another oddball doesn't mean that it's any 
more likely than any other GSV to have the Grey Area aboard; the 
GCU will have to lie off, and that'll make this Mimage-stealing trick 
easier.  If the Grey Area was actually inside the GSV at the time it 
probably couldn't carry it off undetected.' 

Genar-Hofoen was looking thoughtful again. 'This artifact thing,' he 
said. 'Could almost be a what-do-you-call it, couldn't it?  An Outside 
Context Paradox.' 

'Problem,' Tishlin said. 'Outside Context Problem.' 

'Hmm.  Yes.  One of those.  Almost.' 

An Outside Context Problem was the sort of thing most civilisations 
encountered just once, and which they tended to encounter rather in 
the same way a sentence encountered a full stop.  The usual example 
given to illustrate an Outside Context Problem was imagining you 
were a tribe on a largish, fertile island; you'd tamed the land, 
invented the wheel or writing or whatever, the neighbours were 
cooperative or enslaved but at any rate peaceful and you were busy 
raising temples to yourself with all the excess productive capacity you 
had, you were in a position of near-absolute power and control which 
your hallowed ancestors could hardly have dreamed of and the whole 
situation was just running along nicely like a canoe on wet grass… 
when suddenly this bristling lump of iron appears sailless and trailing 
steam in the bay and these guys carrying long funny-looking sticks 
come ashore and announce you've just been discovered, you're all 
subjects of the Emperor now, he's keen on presents called tax and 
these bright-eyed holy men would like a word with your priests. 

That was an Outside Context Problem; so was the suitably up-teched 
version that happened to whole planetary civilisations when 
somebody like the Affront chanced upon them first rather than, say, 
the Culture. 

The Culture had had lots of minor OCPs, problems that could have 
proved to be terminal if they'd been handled badly, but so far it had 
survived them all.  The Culture's ultimate OCP was popularly 
supposed to be likely to take the shape of a galaxy-consuming 
Hegemonising Swarm, an angered Elder civilisation or a sudden, 
indeed instant visit by neighbours from Andromeda once the 
expedition finally got there. 

In a sense, the Culture lived with genuine OCPs all around it all the 
time, in the shape of those Sublimed Elder civilisations, but so far it 

didn't appear to have been significantly checked or controlled by any 
of them.  However, waiting for the first real OCP was the. intellectual 
depressant of choice for those people and Minds in the Culture 
determined to find the threat of catastrophe even in Utopia. 

'Almost.  Maybe,' agreed the apparition. 'Perhaps it's a little less likely 
to be so with your help.' 

Genar-Hofoen nodded, staring at the surface of the table. 'So who's 
in charge of this?' he asked, grinning. 'There's usually a Mind which 
acts as incident controller or whatever they call it in something like 
this.' 

'The Incident Coordinator is a GSV called the Not Invented Here,' Tish 
told him. 'It wants you to know you can ask whatever you want of it.' 

'Uh-huh.' Genar-Hofoen couldn't recall having heard of the ship. 'And 
why me, particularly?' he asked.  He suspected he already had the 
answer to that one. 

'The Sleeper Service has been behaving even more oddly than usual,' 
Tishlin said, looking suitably pained.  'It's altered its course schedule, 
it's no longer accepting people for Storage, and it's almost completely 
stopped communicating.  But it says it will allow you on board.' 

'For a brow-beating, no doubt,' Genar-Hofoen said, glancing to one 
side and watching a cloud pass over the meadows of the valley shown 
on the dining room's projector walls. 'Probably wants to give me a 
lecture.' He sighed, still looking round the room.  He fastened his 
gaze on Tishlin's simulation again. 'She still there?' he asked. 

The image nodded slowly. 

'Shit,' Genar-Hofoen said. 

III 

'But it makes my brain hurt.' 

'Nevertheless, Major.  This is of inestimable importance.' 

'I only looked at the first bit there and it's already given me a 
thumping case-ache.' 

'Still, it has to be done.  Kindly read it all carefully and then I'll explain 
its significance.' 

'Knot my stalks, this is a terrible thing to ask of a chap after a 
regimental dinner.' Fivetide wondered if humans suffered so for their 
self-indulgence.  He doubted it, no matter what they claimed; with 
the possibly honourable, possibly demented exception of Genar-
Hofoen, they seemed a bit too stuffy and sensible willingly to submit 
to such self-punishment in the cause of fun.  Besides, they were so 
insecure in their physical inheritance they had meddled with 
themselves in all sorts of ways; probably they thought hangovers 
were just annoying, rather than character-forming and so had, 
shortsightedly, dispensed with them. 

'I realise it's early and it is the morning after the night before, 
Major.  But please.' 

The emissary - which Fivetide had met once before, and which 
possessed the irritating trait of looking somewhat like a better-built 
version of Fivetide's dear departed father - had just appeared in the 
nest house without notice or warning.  If he hadn't known the way 
these things worked, Fivetide would right now be thinking of ways to 
torture the head of nest security.  Tentacles had rolled, beaks had 
been separated, for less. 

Lucky he'd been able to whip the bed covers round his deputy wife 
and both vice courtesans before the blighter had announced his/its 
presence by just floating into the nest. 

Fivetide clapped his forebeak together a couple of times. Tastes like 
I've had me beak up me arse, he thought. 'Can't you just tell me what 
the damn signal means now?' he asked. 

'You won't know what I'm referring to.  Come now; the sooner you 
read it the sooner I'll be able to tell you what it means, and the sooner 
I'll be able to demonstrate how it is just possible that this information

interference forever.' 

'Hmm.  I'm sure.  And what'll it do at most?' 

The emissary of the ship let its eye stalks dip to either side, the 
Affronter equivalent of a smile. 'At most, the information in this signal 
will lead to you being able to dominate the Culture as completely as 
it - if it chose to - could dominate you.' The creature paused. 'This 
signal could conceivably presage the start of a process which will 
deliver the entire Galaxy into your hands, and subsequently open up 
territories for expanεsion and exploitation beyond that which you 
cannot even begin to guess at.  And I do not exaggerate.  Have I 
your attention now, Major?' 

Fivetide snorted sceptically. 'I suppose you have,' he said, shaking 
his limbs and rubbing his eyes.  He returned his gaze to the note 
screen, and read the signal.

3. Uninvited Guests 

I 

The battle of Boustrago had taken place on Xlephier Prime thirteen 
thousand years earlier.  It had been the final, decisive battle in the 
Archipelagic War (though it had, inappropriately, been fought near to 
the centre of a continent), a twenty-year conflict between that world's 
first two great imperial nation states.  The muzzle-loading cannon 
and rifle were state-of-the-art munitions at the time, though the 
cavalry charge was still very much regarded as both the most decisive 
battlefield manoeuvre and quite the finest and most stirring sight that 
warfare had to offer by the military high commands on each 

side.  The combination of modern ordnance and outdated tactics had, 
as ever, created enormous casualties on both sides. 

Amorphia wandered amongst the dead and dying of Hill 4.  The battle 
had by this time moved on; the few defenders who'd survived and 
repelled the initial rush had been ordered to pull back just as the next 
wave of opposing troops had appeared out of the cannon smoke and 
fallen upon them; they had been slaughtered almost to a man and 
the victors had swept on to the next redoubt across the shallow valley 
beyond.  Shattered palisades, lines of stakes and bunkers had been 
chewed up by the initial bombardment and later by the hooves of the 
cavalry.  Bodies lay scattered like twisted, shredded leaves amongst 
the torn-up grassland and the rich brown-red soil.  The blood of men 
and animals saturated the grass in places, making it thick and glossy, 
and collected in little hollows like pools of dark ink. 

The sun was high in the cloudless sky; the only cover was the wispy 
remnants of cannon smoke.  Already a few carrion birds - no longer 
too concerned by the noise of the battle near by - had landed and 
started to investigate the corpses and the shattered bodies of the 
wounded. 

The soldiers wore brightly coloured, cheery-looking uniforms with lots 
of metal buckle-work and very tall hats.  Their guns were long, 
simple-looking things; their pikes, swords and bayonets lay glittering 
in the sunlight.  The animals lying tangled amongst the traces of the 
smashed cannon trains were big, thick-set beasts, almost unadorned; 
the cavalry mounts were almost as gaily decorated as their 
riders.  They all lay together, some with the collapsed shapelessness 
of death, some in a pool of their own internal organs, some missing 
limbs, some in a posture appropriate to a still vital suffering, caught 
in expressions appropriate to their agony, thrashing or writhing or - 
in the case of some of the soldiers - supporting themselves on one 
limb and reaching out to plead for help, or water, or a coup de 
grace to end their torment. 

It was all quite still, frozen like a three-dimensional photoεgraph, 
and it all lay, spread out like some military society's model scene 
made real, in General Bay Three Inner of the GSV Sleeper Service. 

The ship's avatar achieved the top of the low hill and looked out over 
the battle-scene beyond.  It stretched for kilometres in all directions 
across the sunlit rolling downland; a grand confusion of posed men, 
dashing mounts, cavalry charges, cannons and smoke and shadows. 

Getting the smoke right had been the hardest part.  The landscape 
was simplicity itself; a covering of artificial flora on a thin layer of 
sterilised soil lying on a structure of foametal.  The great majority of 
the animals were simply very good sculptures the ship had 
created.  The people were real, of course, though the ones who'd 
been disembowelled or particularly severely mutilated were generally 
sculptures too. 

The details of the scene were as authentic as the ship could make 
them; it had studied every painting, etching and sketch of the battle 
and read every account, military and media report of it, even taking 
the trouble to track down the records of the diary entries of individual 
soldiers, while at the same time undertaking exhaustive research into 
the whole historical period concerned including the uniforms, 
weaponry and tactics in use when the battle had taken place.  For 
what it was worth after so much time, a drone team had visited the 
preserved battle site itself and conducted their own deep-scan of the 
ground.  The fact that Xlephier Prime was one of the twenty or so 
planets that could fairly claim to have been one of the home worlds 
of the Culture - not that it really admitted to having such things - 
made the task easier. 

The GSV had studied the real-time recordings Contact craft and their 
emissaries had taken over the years of battles fought by humanoid 
societies with similar technology, to get a feel for the way such events 
really looked and felt without the possibly prejudiced and partial eyes 
and memories of the participants or spectators getting in the way. 

And it had, eventually, got the smoke right.  It had taken a while, 
and eventually it had had to resort to a rather higher-tech solution 
than it would have preferred, but it had done it.  The smoke was real, 
each particle held and isolated in the grip of a localised anti-gravity 
field produced by projectors hidden underneath the landscape.  The 
ship was quietly proud of the smoke. 

Even the fact that the scene still wasn't perfect - many of the soldiers 
looked female, and/or foreign, or indeed alien, when you looked 
closely at them, and even the males of the appropriate and not-too-
meddled-with genetic stock were too big and too generally healthy to 
be right for the time - didn't really disturb the ship.  The people hadn't 
been the most difficult thing to get right, but they were the most 
important component of the scene; they were the reason it was all 
here. 

Every Culture habitat - whether it was an Orbital or other large 
structure, a ship, a Rock, or a planet - possessed Storage 
facilities.  Storage was where some people went when they had 
reached a certain age, or if they had just grown tired of living.  It was 
one of the choices that Culture humans faced towards the end of their 
artificially extended three-and-a-half to four centuries of life.  They 
could opt for rejuvenation and/or complete immortality, they could 
become part of a group mind, they could simply die when the time 
came, they could transfer out of the Culture altogether, bravely 
accepting one of the open but essentially inscrutable invitations left 
by certain Elder civilisations, or they could go into Storage, with 
whatever revival criterion they desired. 

Some people slept for - say - a hundred years at a time then lived a 
single day before returning to their undreaming, unageing slumbers, 
some wanted simply to be woken after a set time had passed to see 
what had changed while they'd been gone, some desired to come 
back when something especially interesting was happening (content 
to leave that judgement to others), and some only wanted to be 
brought back if and when the Culture finally became one of the Elders 
itself. 

That was a decision the Culture had been putting off for many 
millennia; in theory it could have sublimed anything up to ten 
thousand years ago, but - while individuals and small groups of 
people and Minds did sublime all the time, and other parts of the 

society had hived off and split away, to make their own decisions on 
the matter - the bulk of the Culture had chosen not to, determining 
instead to surf a line across the ever-breaking wave of galactic life 
continuation. 

Partly it was a kind of curiosity that no doubt seemed childish to any 
sublimed species; a feeling that there was still more to discover in 
base reality, even if its laws and rules were all perfectly known (and 
besides, what of other galaxies, what of other universes?  Did the 
Elders have access to these but none of them had ever seen fit to 
communicate the truth to the unsublimed?  Or did all such 
considerations simply cease to matter, post-sublimation?). 

Partly it was an expression of the Culture's extrovertly conεcerned 
morality; the sublimed Elders, become as gods to all intents and 
purposes, seemed to be derelict in the duties which the more naive 
and less developed societies they left behind ascribed to such entities. 
"With certain very limited exceptions, the Elder species subsequently 
took almost nothing to do with the rest of life in the galaxy whose 
physical trappings they invariably left behind; tyrants went 
unchecked, 
hegemonies 
went 
unchallenged, 
genocides 
went 

unstopped and whole nascent civilisations were snuffed out just 
because their planet suffered a comet-strike or happened to be too 
near a super-nova, even though these events occurred under the 
metaphorical noses of the sublimed ones. 

The implication was that the very ideas, the actual concepts of good, 
of fairness and of justice just ceased to matter once one had gone for 
sublimation, no matter how creditable, progressive and unselfish 
one's behaviour had been as a species pre-sublimation.  In a 
curiously puritanical way for society seemingly so hell-bent on the 
ruthless pursuit of pleasure, the Culture thought this was itself wrong, 
and so decided to attempt to accomplish what the gods, it seemed, 
could not be bothered with; discovering, judging and encouraging - 
or discouraging - the behaviour of those to whom its own powers 
were scarcely less than those of a deity.  Its own Elderhood would 
come eventually, it had no doubt, but it would be damned if it would 
let that happen until it had grown tired of doing (what it hoped was) 
good. 

For those who wished to await that judgment day without having to 
live through every other day in between, Storage was the answer, as 
it was for others, for all those other reasons. 

The rate of technological change in the Culture, at least at the level 
which directly affected the humans within it, was fairly modest.  For 
millennia the accepted and normal method of Storing a human was 
to place each in a coffin-like box a little over two metres long, just 
under one across and half a metre deep; such units were easy to 
make and suitably reliable.  However, even such unglamorous staples 
of Culture existence couldn't escape improvement and refinement for 
ever.  Eventually, along with the development of the gelfield suit, it 
became possible to put people into the stasis of long-term Storage 
within a covering that was even more reliable than the old coffin-
boxes, and yet scarcely thicker than a second skin or a layer of 
clothing. 

The Sleeper Service - which was not called that then - had simply 
been the first ship fully to take advantage of this development.  When 
it Stored people it usually did so in small tableaux after the manner 
of famous paintings, at first, or humorous poses; the Storage suits 
allowed their occupants to be posed in any way that would have been 
natural for a human, and it was a simple matter to add a pigmentation 
layer to the surface which did such a good job of impersonating skin 
that a human would have to look very closely indeed to spot the 
difference.  Of course, the ship had always asked the permission of 
the Storees in question before it used their sleeping forms in this way, 
and respected the wishes of the few people who preferred not to be 
Stored in a situation where they might be gazed upon as though they 
were figures in a painting, or sculptures. 

Back then, the GSV had been called the Quietly Confident, and it had 
been run, as ships of that class normally were, by not one but three 
Minds.  What happened next depended on who you believed. 

The official version was that when one of the three Minds had decided 
it wanted to quit the Culture the other two Minds had argued with it 
and then made the unusual decision to leave the structure of the GSV 
to the single dissenting Mind, rather than, as would have been more 
normal, just giving it a smaller ship. 

The perhaps more plausible and certainly more interesting rumour 
was that there had been a good old-fashioned wing-ding battle 
between the Minds, two against one, and the two had lost, very much 
against the odds.  The two losing Minds had been kicked out, taking 
to commandeered GCUs like officers given life boats after a 
mutiny.  And that was why, this version went, the whole of 
the Quietly 
Confident 
- which 
promptly 
renamed 
itself 

the Sleeper Service, had been turned over to the single dissident 
Mind; it hadn't been some gentlepeople's agreement; it had been a 
revolution. 

Whatever version you chose to believe, it was no secret that the 
Culture proper had chosen to dedicate another, smaller, GSV to the 
task of following the Sleeper Service wherever it went, presumably 
to keep an eye on it. 

Following its renaming, and paying no apparent heed to the craft now 
tailing it, the Sleeper Service's next step was to evacuate everybody 
else remaining aboard.  Most of the ships had already gone, and the 
rest were asked to leave.  Then the drones, aliens and all the human 
personnel and their pets were deposited on the first Orbital it came 
to.  The only people left aboard were those in Storage. 

After that the ship went in search of others (and one other in 
particular), and let it be known throughout the Culture, through its 
information network, that it was willing to travel anywhere to pick up 
those who might wish to join it, so long as they were in Storage and 
happy to be set amongst one of its tableaux. 

People were reluctant at first; this was definitely the sort of behaviour 
that earned a ship the title Eccentric, and Eccentric ships had been 
known to do odd, even dangerous things.  Still, the Culture had its 
share of brave souls, and a few took up the craft's strange invitation, 
without apparent ill effect.  When the first few people who had been 
Stored aboard the GSV were safely returned on the realisation of their 
revival criteria, again without seeming to have suffered for the 
strangeness of their temporary lodgings, the slow trickle of 
adventurous individuals began to turn into a steady stream of slightly 
perverse or just romantic ones; as the reputation of the Sleeper 
Service spread, and it released holograms of its more and more 

ambitious tableaux (important historical incidents, then small battles 
and details from greater conflicts), so more and more people thought 
it rather amusing to be Stored within this eccentric Eccentric, where 
they might be said to be forming part of a work of art even while they 
slept, rather than just plonked in a boring box somewhere underneath 
their local Plate. 

And so taking a ride aboard the Sleeper Service as a kind of 
vicariously wandering soul became nothing less than fashionable, and 
the ship slowly filled with undead people in Storage suits whom it 
posed into larger and larger scenes, until eventually it was able to 
tackle whole battlefields and lay them out in the sixteen square 
kilometres of territory it possessed in each of its General Bays. 

Amorphia completed its sweeping gaze across the bright, silent 
stillness of the vast killing ground.  As an avatar it possessed no real 
thoughts of its own, but the Mind that was the Sleeper Service liked 
to run the creature off a small sub-routine that was only a little more 
intelligent than the average human being - while both retaining the 
option of stepping in, full force, if it needed to and making the avatar 
behave in a confused, distracted state that the ship believed 
somehow reflected, on the nearly infinitely smaller human scale, its 
own philosophical perplexities. 

So it was that the semi-human sub-routine looked out across that 
great tableau, and felt a kind of sadness that it might all have to be 
dismantled.  There was an extra, perhaps deeper melancholy at the 
thought that it would no longer be able to play host to the living things 
aboard; the creatures of the sea and the air and the gas-giant 
atmosphere, and the woman. 

Its thoughts turned to that woman; Dajeil Gelian, who in one sense 
had been the cause, the seed for all of this, and the one person it had 
wanted to find, the one soul - asleep or awake - it had been 
determined to offer sanctuary to when it had first renounced the 
Culture's normality.  Now that sanctuary was compromised, and she 
too would have to be offloaded with all the rest of its waifs and strays 
and teeming undead.  A promise being fulfilled leading to a promise 
to her being broken, as though she had not experienced enough of 
that in her life.  Still, it would make amends, and for that reason there 

were a lot of other promises being made and - so far, it would seem 
- kept.  That would have to do. 

Movement on the motionless tableau; Amorphia turned its attention 
there and saw the black bird Gravious flapping away across the 
field.  More movement.  Amorphia walked towards it, around and 
over the poised, charging cavalry and the fallen soldiers, between a 
pair of convincing-looking hanging fountains of earth where two 
cannon balls were slamming into the ground and over a small, blood-
swollen stream to another part of the battlefield, where a team of 
three revival drones were floating above a revivee. 

This was unusual; people normally wanted to be woken back in their 
home and in the presence of friends, but over the last couple of 
decades - as the tableaux had become more impressive - more people 
had wished to be brought back to life here, in the midst of them. 

Amorphia squatted down by the woman, who had been lying posed 
as a dying soldier, her tunic punctured by bullet holes and stained 
red.  She lay on her back, blinking in the sunlight, attended by 
machines.  The head of the Storage suit had been slipped off and lay 
like a rubbery mask on the grass beside her; her face looked pale and 
just a little blotchy; she was an old woman, but her depilated head 
gave her a curious, baby-like quality of nakedness. 

'Hello?' Amorphia said, taking one of the woman's hands in hers and 
gently detaching that part of the suit too, pulling the hand-covering 
off inside-out, like a tight glove. 

'Whoa,' the woman said, swallowing, her eyes watering. 

Sikleyr-Najasa Croepise Ince Stahal da Mapin, Stored thirty-one 
years ago at the age of three-hundred and eighty-six.  Revival 
criterion: on the acclamation of the next Line Messiah-elect on the 
planet Ischeis.  She had been a scholar of the planet's major religion 
and had wanted to be present at the Elevation of its next Saviour, an 
event which had not been anticipated for another two hundred years 
or so. 

Her mouth twisted, and she coughed. 'How-?' she began, then 
coughed again. 

'Just thirty-one standard years,' Amorphia told her. 

The woman's eyes widened, then she smiled. 'That was quick,' she 
said. 

She recovered rapidly for one of her age; in a few minutes she was 
able to be helped to her feet and - taking Amorphia's arm, and trailed 
by the three drones - they walked across the battlefield towards the 
nearest edge of the tableau. 

They stood on the small hill, Hill 4, that Amorphia had stood on a little 
earlier.  Amorphia was distantly, naggingly aware of the gap the 
woman's revival had left in the scene.  Normally she would have been 
replaced within the day with another Storee, posed in the same 
position, but there were none left; the gap she had left would remain 
unless the ship plundered another tableau to repair the hole in this 
one.  The woman gazed around her for some time, then shook her 
head. 

Amorphia guessed what she was thinking. 'It is a terrible sight,' it 
said. 'But it was the last great land battle on Xlephier Prime.  To have 
one's final significant battle at such an early technological stage is 
actually a great achievement for a humanoid species.' 

The woman turned to Amorphia. 'I know,' she said. 'I was just 
thinking how impressive all this was.  You must be proud.' 

II 

The Explorer Ship Peace Makes Plenty, a vessel of the Stargazer Clan, 
part of the Fifth Fleet of the Zetetic Elench, had been invesεtigating 
a little-explored part of the Upper Leaf Swirl on a standard random 
search pattern.  It had left Tier habitat on n4.28.725.500 along with 
the seven other Stargazer vessels; they had scattered like seeds into 
the depths of the Swirl, bidding each other farewell and knowing they 
might never see each other again. 

One month in, and the ship had turned up nothing special; just a few 
bits of uncharted interstellar debris, duly logged, and that was 
all.  There was a hint - a probably false-signal resonation in the skein 
of space-time behind them - that there might be a craft following 
them, but then it was not unusual for other civilisations to follow ships 
of the Zetetic Elench. 

The Elench had once been part of the Culture proper; they had split 
off fifteen hundred years ago, the few habitats and the many Rocks, 
ships, drones and humans concerned preferring to take a slightly 
different line from the mainstream Culture.  The Culture aimed to 
stay roughly as it was and change at least a proportion of those lesser 
civilisations it discovered, while acting as an honest broker between 
the Involved - the more developed societies who made up the current 
players in the great galactic civilisational game. 

The Elench wanted to alter themselves, not others; they sought out 
the undiscovered not to change it but to be changed by it.  The 
Elencher ideal was that somebody from a more stable society - the 
Culture itself was the perfect example - could meet the same Elencher 
- Rock, ship, drone or human - on successive occasions and never 
encounter the same entity twice.  They would have changed between 
meetings just because in the interim they had encountered some 
other civilisation and incorporated some different technology into 
their bodies or information into their minds.  It was a search for the 
sort of pan-relevant truth that the Culture's monosophical approach 
was unlikely ever to throw up; it was a vocation, a mission, a calling. 

The results of this attitude were as various as might be imagined; 
entire Elencher fleets had either never come back from expeditions, 
and remained lost, or had eventually been found, the vessels and 
their crews completely, if willingly, subsumed by another civilisation. 

At its most extreme, in the old days, some craft had been discovered 
turned entirely into Aggressive Hegemonising Swarm Objects; 
selfishly auto-replicating organisms determined to turn every piece 
of matter they found into copies of themselves.  There were 
techniques - beyond simple outright destruction, which was always 
an option - for dealing with this sort of eventuality which normally 
resulted 
in 
the 
Objects 
concerned 
becoming 
Evangelical 

Hegemonising Swarm Objects rather than Aggressive Hegemonising 
Swarm Objects, but if the Objects concerned had been particularly 
single-minded, it still meant that people had died to contribute to its 
greedily ungracious self-regard. 

These days, the Elench very rarely ran into anything like that sort of 
trouble, but they did still change all the time.  In a way, the Elench, 
even more than the Culture, was an attitude rather than an easily 
definable grouping of ships or people.  Because parts of Elench were 
constantly being subsumed and assimilated, or just disappearing, 
while at the same time other individuals and small groups were 
joining it (both from the Culture and from other societies, human and 
otherwise), there was anyway a turn-over of personnel and 
secondary ideas that made it one of the most rapidly evolving in-play 
civilisations.  Somehow, though, despite it all, and perhaps because 
it was more an attitude, a meme, than anything else, the Elench had 
developed an ability that it had arguably inherited from its parent 
civilisation; the ability to remain roughly the same in the midst of 
constant change. 

It also had a knack of turning up intriguing things - ancient artifacts, 
new civilisations, the mysterious remnants of Sublimed species, 
unguessably old depositories of antique knowledge - not all of which 
were of ultimate interest to the Elench itself, but many of which might 
excite the curiosity, further the purposes and benefit the 
informational or monetary funds of others, especially if they could get 
to them before anybody else.  Such opportunities arose but rarely, 
but they had occurred sufficiently often in the past for certain 
societies of an opportunistic bent to consider it worth the expense or 
the bother of dedicating a ship to follow an Elencher craft, for a while 
at least, and so the Peace Makes Plenty had not been unduly alarmed 
by the discovery that it might be being tailed. 

Two months in.  And still nothing exciting; just gas clouds, dust 
clouds, brown dwarfs and a couple of lifeless star systems.  All well 
enough charted from afar and displaying no sign of ever having been 
touched by anything intelligent. 

Even the hint of the following ship had disappeared; if it ever had 
been 
real, 
the 
vessel 
concerned 
had 
probably 
decided 

the Peace Makes 
Plenty was 
not 
going 
to 
strike 
lucky 
this 

trip.  Nevertheless, everything the Elencher ship came within range 
of was scanned; passive sensors filtered the natural spectrum for 
signs of meaning, beams and pulses were sent out into the vacuum 
and across the skein of space-time, searching and probing, while the 
ship consumed whatever echoes came back, analysing, considering, 
evaluating… 

Seventy-eight days after leaving Tier, approaching a red giant star 
named Esperi from a direction which according to its records nobody 
had ever taken before, the Peace Makes Plenty had discovered an 
artifact, fourteen light months distant from the sun itself. 

The artifact was a little over fifty kilometres in diameter.  It was 
black-body; an ambient anomaly, indistinguishable from a distance 
from any given volume of almost empty interstellar space.  The Peace 
Makes Plenty only noticed it at all because it occluded part of a distant 
galaxy and the Elencher ship, knowing that bits of galaxies did not 
just wink off and back on again of their own accord, had turned to 
investigate. 

The artifact appeared to be either almost completely massless, or - 
perhaps - some sort of projection; it seemed to make no impresεsion 
on the skein, the fabric of space-time which any accumulation of 
matter effectively dents with its mass, like a boulder lying on a 
trampoline.  The artifact/projection gave the impression that it was 
floating on the skein, making no impression on it whatsoever.  This 
was unusual; this was certainly worth investigating.  Even more 
intriguingly, there was also a possible anomaly in the lower energy 
grid, which underlay the fabric of real space.  There was a region 
directly underneath the three-dimensional form of the artifact that, 
intermittently, seemed to lack the otherwise universally chaotic 
nature of the Grid; there was a vaguest-of-vague hint of order there, 
almost as if the artifact was casting some sort of bizarre - indeed, 
impossible - shadow.  Even more curious. 

The Peace Makes Plenty hove to, sitting in front of the artifact - in as 
much as it could be said to have a front - and trying both to analyse 
it and communicate with it. 

Nothing; the black-body sphere appeared to be massless and 
inviolable, almost as though it was a blister on the skein itself, as 
though the signals the ship was sending towards it could never 
connect with a thing there because all they did was slide flickering 
over that blister almost as though it wasn't there and pass on 
undisturbed into space beyond; as though, trying to pick up.a stone 
that appeared to be resting on the surface of a trampoline, one 
discovered that the trampoline surface itself was bulged up to cover 
the stone. 

The ship decided to attempt to contact the artifact in a more direct 
manner; it would send a drone-probe underneath the object in 
hyperspace, below the surface of space-time; effectively making a 
tear, a rent in the fabric of the skein - the sort of opening it would 
normally create to fashion a way into HS through which it could 
travel.  The drone-probe would attempt, as it were, to surface inside 
the artifact; if there was nothing there but a projection, it would find 
out; if there was something there, it would presumably either be 
prevented from entering it, or accepted within.  The ship readied its 
emissary. 

The situation was so unusual the Peace Makes Plenty even considered 
breaking with Elench precedent by informing Tier habitat or one of its 
peers what was going on; the nearest other Stargazer craft was a 
month's travel away, but might be able to help if the Peace Makes 
Plenty got itself into trouble.  In the end, however, it stuck with 
tradition and kept quiet.  There was a kind of stealthy pragmatism in 
this; an encounter of the sort the ship was embarking upon might 
only be successful if the Elencher craft could fairly claim to be acting 
on its own, without having made what might, to a suspicious 
contactee, look like a request for reinforcements. 

Plus, there was simple pride involved; an Elencher ship would not be 
an Elencher ship if it started acting like part of a committee; why, it 
might as well then be a Culture ship! 

The 
drone-probe 
was 
dispatched 
with 
the Peace 
Makes 

Plenty keeping in close contact.  The instant the probe passed within 
the horizon of the artifact, it- 

Something, obviously, had happened. 

The next thing it personally knew, the Peace Makes Plenty had been 
under attack.  The assault had been almost unbelievably swift and 
ferocious; the drone-probe must have been taken over almost 
instantaneously, the ship's subsystems surrendered milliseconds 
later and the integrity of the ship's Mind shattered within - at a guess 
- less than a second after the drone-probe had infringed the space 
beneath the artifact. 

A few more seconds later and Sisela Ytheleus 1/2 itself had been 
involved in a last desperate attempt to get word of the ship's plight 
to the outside galaxy while the vessel's usurped systems did their 
damnedest to prevent it; by destroying it if necessary.  The long-
agreed, carefully worked-out ruse using itself and its twin and the 
preprogrammed independent Displacer unit had worked, though only 
just, and even so, with considerable damage to the drone that had 
been Sisela Ytheleus 2/2 and was now Sisela Ytheleus 1/2, with a 
kind of twisted remnant of Sisela Ytheleus 2/2 lodged within it. 

The drone had carried out the equivalent of pressing an ear to the 
wall of the core with its twin's mind in it, carefully accessing a 
meaning-free abstract of the activity inside the closed-off core to find 
out what was happening in there.  It was like listening to a furious 
argument going on in an adjoining room; a chilling, frightening 
sound; the sort of bawling match that made you expect the sound of 
screams and things breaking, any moment. 

Its original self had probably died in the process of escape; instead 
of its own body it now inhabited that of its twin, whose violated, 
defected mind-state now raged helplessly within the core labelled 
2/2. 

The drone, still tumbling through interstellar space at two hundred 
and eighty kilometres a second, felt a kind of revulsion at the very 

idea of having a treacherous, perverted version of its twin locked 
inside its own mind.  Its first reaction was to expunge it; it thought 
about just dumping the core into the vacuum and wasting it with its 
laser, the one weapon which still seemed to be working at close to 
normal capacity; or it could just shut off power to the core, letting 
whatever was in it die for want of energy. 

And yet it mustn't; like the two higher mind components, the ravaged 
version of its twin's mind-state might contain clues to the nature of 
the artifact's own mind-type.  It, the AI core and the photonic nucleus 
all had to be kept as evidence; retained, perhaps, as samples from 
which a kind of antidote to the artifact's poisonous infectivity might 
be drawn.  There was even a chance that something of its twin's true 
personality might be retained in the rapacious mind-state the two 
upper minds and the core contained. 

Equally, there was a possibility that the ship's Mind had lost control 
but not integrity; perhaps - like a small garrison quitting the 
undefendable curtain wall of a great fortress to take refuge in an all-
but-invulnerable central keep - the Mind had been forced to dissociate 
itself from all its subsystems and given up command to the invader, 
but succeeded in retaining its own personality in a Mind core as 
invulnerable to infiltration as the electronic core within the drone's 
mind (where what was left of its twin now seethed) was proof against 
escape. 

Elencher Minds had been in such dire situations before and survived; 
certainly such a core could be destroyed (they could not have their 
power turned off, as the drone's core could; Mind cores had their own 
internal energy sources) but even the most brutal aggressor would 
far rather lay siege to that keep-core in the knowledge that the 
information contained within must surely fall to it eventually, than 
just destroy it. 

There was always hope, the drone told itself; it must not give up 
hope.  According to the specifications it had, the Displacer which had 
catapulted it out of the ill-fated ship had a range - with something 
the volume of Sisela Ytheleus 1/2 - of nearly a light second.  Surely 
that was far enough to put it beyond range of detection?  Certainly 
the Peace Makes Plenty's sensors wouldn't have had a hope of 

spotting something so small so far away; it just had to hope that 
neither could the artifact. 

Excession; that was what the Culture called such things.  It had 
become a pejorative term and so the Elench didn't use it normally, 
except sometimes informally, amongst themselves.  Excession; 
something excessive.  Excessively aggressive, excessively powerful, 
excessively expansionist; whatever.  Such things turned up or were 
created now and again.  Encountering an example was one of the 
risks you ran when you went a-wandering. 

It had to get word to outside; that was the task it had been entrusted 
with by the ship, that was what its whole life-mission had become the 
instant the ship came under such intensive attack. 

But how?  Its tiny warp unit had been destroyed, its bom-com unit 
likewise, its HS laser too.  It had nothing that worked at translight 
speeds, no way of unsticking itself or even a signal from the glutinous 
slowness that trapped anything unable to step outside the skein of 
space-time.  The drone felt as if it was some quick, graceful flying 
insect, knocked down to a stagnant pond and trapped there by 
surface tension, all grace abandoned in its bedraggled, doomed 
struggle with a strange, cloyingly foreign medium. 

It considered again the sub-core where its self-repair mechanisms 
waited.  But not its own repair systems; those of its turncoat twin.  It 
was beyond belief that those too had not been subverted by the 
invader.  Worse than useless; a temptation.  Because there was a 
vanishingly small chance that in all the excitement they had not been 
taken over. 

Temptation… But no; it couldn't risk it.  It would be folly. 

It would have to make its own self-repair units.  It was possible, but 
it would take forever; a month.  For a human a month was not that 
long; for a drone - even one thinking at the shamefully slow speed of 
light on the skein - it was like a sequence of life sentences.  A month 
was not a long time to wait; drones were very good at waiting and 
had a whole suite of techniques to pass the time pleasεantly or just 
side-step it, but it was an abominably long time to have 
to concentrate on anything, to have to work at a single task. 

Even at the end of that month, it would just be the start.  At the very 
least there would be a lot of fine tuning to be done; the self-repair 
mechanisms would need direction, amendment, tinkering with; some 
would doubtless dismantle where they were supposed to build, others 
would duplicate what they were meant to scour.  It would be like 
releasing millions of potential cancer cells into an already damaged 
animal body and trying to keep track of each one.  It could quite 
easily kill itself by mistake, or accidentally breach the containment 
around the core of its corrupted twin or the original self-repair 
mechanisms.  Even if all went well, the whole process could take 
years. 

Despair! 

It set the initial routines under way all the same - what else could it 
do? - and thought on. 

It had a few million particles of anti-matter stored, it had some 
maniple-field capability left (somewhere between finger- and arm-
strength, but down-scalable to the point of being able to work at the 
micrometer scale, and capable of slicing molecular bonds; it would 
need both capabilities when it came to building the prototype self-
repairer constructs), it possessed two hundred. and forty one-
millimetre-long nanomissiles, also AM tipped, it could still put up a 
small mirror field about it, and it had its laser, which was not far off 
maximum potential.  Plus it still had the thimbleful of mush that had 
been the final-resort back-up biochemical brain…  Which might no 
longer be able to support thought, but could still inspire it… 

Well, it was one way to use the nasty gooey mess.  Sisela Ytheleus 
1/2 started to fashion a shielded reaction chamber and began working 

out both how best to bring the anti-matter and the cellular gunge 
together to provide itself with the most reaction mass and maximum 
thrust and how to direct the resulting exhaust plume so as to 
minimise the chances of attracting attention. 

Accelerating into the stars using a wasted brain; it had its amusing 
side, it supposed.  It set those routines in motion too and - with the 
equivalent of a long sigh and the taking off of a jacket and the rolling 
up of sleeves - returned its attention to the self-repairer-building 
problem. 

At that instant a skein wave passed around and through it; a sharp, 
purposeful ripple in space-time. 

It stopped thinking for a nanosecond. 

A few things produced such waves.  Several were natural; 
colεlapsing stellar cores, for example.  But this wave was 
compressed, tightly folded; not the massive, swell-long surge created 
when a star contracted into a black hole. 

This wave was not natural; it had been made.  It was a signal.  Or it 
was part of a sense. 

The drone Sisela Ytheleus 1/2 was helplessly aware of its body, the 
few kilos of mass it represented, resonating; producing an echoing 
signal that would transmit back along the radius of that expanding 
circular disturbance in the skein to whatever instrument had 
produced the pulse in the first place. 

It felt… not despair.  It felt sick. 

It waited. 

The reaction was not long in coming; a delicate, fanning, probing 
cluster of maser filaments, rods of energy seeming to converge 
almost at infinity, some distance off to one side from where it had 
guessed the artifact was, three hundred thousand or so kilometres 
away… 

The drone tried to shield itself from the signals, but they overcame 
it.  It started to shut down certain systems which might conceivably 
be corrupted by an attack through the maser signal itself, though the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
beam 
had 
not 
looked 
particularly 

sophisticated.  Then suddenly the beam shut off. 

The drone looked around.  Nothing to be seen, but even as it scanned 
the cold, empty depths of the space around it, it felt the surface of 
space-time 
itself 
tremble 
again, 
all 
around 
it, 
ever 
so 

slightly.  Something was coming. 

The distant vibration increased slowly…  The insect trapped in the 
surface tension of the pond would have gone still now, while the water 
quivered and whatever was advancing upon it - skating across the 
water's surface or angling up from underneath - approached its 
helpless prey. 

III 

The car zipped along, slung under one of the monorails that ran 
amongst the superconducting coils beneath the ceiling of the 
habitat.  Genar-Hofoen looked down through the angled windows of 
the car at the clouded framescape below. 

God'shole habitat (it was much too small to be called an Orbital 
according to the Culture's definitive nomenclature, plus it was 
enclosed) was - at nearly a thousand years old - one of the Affront's 
older outposts in a region of space most civilisations had long since 
agreed to call the Fernblade.  The small world was in the shape of a 
hollow ring; a tube ten kilometres in diameter and two thousand two 
hundred long which had been joined into a circle; the superconducting 
coils and EM wave guides formed the inner rim of the enormous 
wheel.  The tiny, rapidly spinning black hole which provided the 
structure's power sat where the wheel's hub would have been.  The 
circular-sectioned living space was like a highly pressurised tyre 
bulging from the inner rim, and where its tread would have been hung 
the gantries and docks where the ships of the Affront and a dozen 
other species came and went. 

The whole lot was in a slow, distant orbit about an otherwise satellite-
less brown dwarf mass just too small to be a proper star but which 
had long had the honour of being in exactly the right place to further 
the continuing expansion and consolidation of the Affront sphere of 
influence. 

The monorail car rushed towards a huge wall spread entirely across 
the view ahead.  The rails disappeared into a small, circular door, 
which opened like a sphincter as the car approached, then closed 
again behind it.  It was dim in the car for a while as it traversed a 
short tunnel, then another door ahead of it dilated and it shot out into 
a huge open, mist-filled space where the view just disappeared 
amongst clouds and haze. 

The interior of God'shole habitat was sectioned off into about forty 
individually isolable compartments, most of them crissεcrossed by a 
web-work of frames, girders and tubular members, partly to provide 
additional strength for the structure but partly because these created 
a multitude of places for the Affront to anchor the nest spaces that 
were the basic cellular building-block of their architecture.  There 
were more open compartments every few sections along the habitat, 
filled with little more than layers of cloud, a few floating nest space 
bundles and a selection of flora and fauna.  These were the sections 
which more closely mirrored conditions on the sort of mainly 
methane-atmosphered planets and moons the Affront preferred, and 
it was in these the Affront indulged their greatest passion, by going 
hunting.  It was one of these immense game reserves that the car 
was now crossing.  Genar-Hofoen looked downwards again, but he 
couldn't see a hunt in progress. 

As much as a fifth of the whole habitat was devoted to hunting space, 
and even that represented a huge concession to practicality by the 
Affront; they'd probably have preferred the proportions to be about 
half-and-half hunting space and everything else, and even then have 
thought they were being highly responsible and self-sacrificing. 

Genar-Hofoen found himself wondering again about the tradeεoff 
between skill-honing and distraction that took place in the 
development of any species likely to end up as one of those in play 
in the great galactic civilisation game.  The Culture's standard 

assessment held that the Affront spent far too much time hunting and 
not nearly enough time getting on with the business of being a 
responsible space-faring species (though of course the Culture was 
sophisticated enough to know that this was just its, admittedly 
subjective, way of looking at things; and besides, the more time the 
Affront spent dallying in their hunting parks and regaling each other 
with hunting tales in their carousing halls, the less they had for 
rampaging across their bit of the galaxy being horrible to people). 

But if the Affront didn't love hunting as much as they did, would they 
still be the Affront?  Hunting, especially the highly cooperative form 
of hunting in three dimensions which the Affront had evolved, 
required and encouraged intelligence, and it was generally - though 
not exclusively - intelligence that took a species into space.  The 
required mix of common sense, invenεtiveness, compassion and 
aggression required was different for each; perhaps if you tried to 
make the Affront just a little less enraptured by hunting you would 
only be able to do so by making them much less intelligent and 
inquisitive.  It was like play; it was fun at the time, when you were a 
child, but it was also training for when you became an adult.  Fun was 
serious. 

Still no sign of a hunt in progress, or even of any herds of prey 
animals.  Just a few filmy mats and hanging verticals of floating plant 
life.  Doubtless some of the smaller animals which a few species of 
the prey-creatures themselves predated would be hanging munching 
away on the membranes and gas sacs of the flora, but they were 
invisible from this distance with the haze preventing closer inspection. 

Genar-Hofoen sat back.  There was no seat to sit back on because 
the monorail car wasn't built for humans, but the gelfield suit was 
imitating the effects of a seat.  He wore his usual gilet and holster.  At 
his feet was his gelfield hold-all.  He looked at it, then prodded it with 
a foot.  It didn't look much to be taking on a round trip of six thousand 
light years. 

~ Bastards, the module said inside his head. 

~ What? he asked it. 

~ They seem to enjoy leaving everything to the last moment, the 
module said, sounding annoyed. ~ You know, we only just finished 
negotiating for the hire of the ships?  I mean, you're due to leave in 
about ten minutes; how late can these maniacs leave things? 

~ Ships plural? he asked. 

~ Ships plural, the module said. ~ They insist we hire three of their 
ridiculous tubs.  Any one of which could easily accommodate me, I 
might add; that's another point at issue.  But three!  Can you 
believe?  That's practically a fleet by their standards! 

~ Must need the money. 

~ Genar-Hofoen, I know you think it amusing to be the cause of the 
transfer of funds to the Affront, but might I point out to you that 
where it is not to all intents and purposes irrelevant, money is power, 
money is influence, money is effect. 

~ 'Money is effect', Genar-Hofoen mused. ~ That one of your own, 
Scopell-Afranqui? 

~ The point is that every time we donate the Affront extra means of 
exchange we effectively become part of their expansionist drive.  It 
is not moral. 

~ Shit, we gave them Orbital-building technology; how does that 
compare with a few gambling debts? 

~ That was different; we only gave them that so they'd stop taking 
over so many planets and because they didn't trust the Orbitals we 
made for them.  And I'm not talking about your gambling debts, 
however outrageous, or your bizarre habit of bidding-up the price of 
bribes.  I'm talking about the cost of hiring three Affronter Nova Class 
Battle-Cruisers and their crews for two months. 

Genar-Hofoen almost laughed out loud. ~ SC isn't putting that 
on your tab, is it? 

~ Of course not.  I was thinking of the wider picture. 

~ What the fuck am I supposed to do? he protested. ~ This is the 
fastest way of getting me where SC wants me to be.  Not my fault. 

~ You could have said No. 

~ Could have.  And you'd have spent the next year or so biting my 
ear about not doing my duty to the Culture when I was asked. 

~ Your only motive, I'm sure, Scopell-Afranqui said sniffily as the 
monorail car slowed.  The module went off-line with an ostentatious 
click. 

Prick, Genar-Hofoen thought, unheard. 

The monorail car passed through another couple of habitat section 
walls, exiting into a crowded-looking industrial section where the keel 
skeletons of newly begun Affronter ships rose out of the haze like 
oddly inappropriate collections of spines and ribs, ornate elaborations 
within the greater framework of buttresses and columns supporting 
the habitat itself.  The monorail car continued to slow until it drew to 
a stop within a web-tube attached to one of the structural 
members.  The car started to drop, almost in free-fall. 

The car vibrated.  In fact, it was rattling.  Genar-Hofoen had grown 
up on a Culture Orbital where only sporting vehicles and things you 
built yourself for a laugh ever vibrated; normal transport systems 
rarely ever even made a noise unless it was to ask which floor you 
wanted or whether you'd like the on-board scent changed. 

The monorail car flashed through a floor and into another giganεtic 
hangar space where the towering shapes of half-finished craft rose 
like barbed pinnacles out of the mist-shrouded framework of slender 
girders below.  The bladed hulls of the ships blurred past to one side. 

~ Wee-hee! said the gelfield suit, which thought Affronter free-fall 
was just a total hoot. 

~ Glad you're amused, Genar-Hofoen thought. 

~ I hope you realise that if this thing crashes now, even I won't be 
able to stop you breaking most of your major bones, the suit informed 
him. 

~ If you can't say something helpful, shut the fuck up, he told it. 

Another floor rushed up to meet the car; it plummeted through to a 
vast, misty hall where almost-finished Affronter ships rose like jagged 
sky-scrapers.  The car came juddering and screeching to a halt near 
the floor of the huge space - the suit clamped around him in support, 
but Genar-Hofoen could feel his insides doing uncomfortable things 
under the effects of the additional apparent gravity - then the car 
cycled through a pair of airlocks and rumbled down a dark tunnel. 

It came out on to the edge of the underside of the habitat where, a 
succession of docks shaped like giant rib-cages disappeared away 
along the lazy curve of the little world; there was a lot of glare but a 
few bright stars shone in the darkness.  About half the docks were 
occupied, some with Affronter ships, some with craft from a handful 
of other species.  Dwarfing all the others were three huge dark craft, 
each of which looked vaguely as though it had been modelled by 
taking a free-fall aerial bomb from one age and welding onto it a 
profusion of broad swords, scimitars and daggers from an even earlier 
time and then magnifying the result until each was a couple of 
kilometres in length.  They hung cradled in docks a few kilometres 
off; the car swung round and headed towards them. 

~ The good ships SacSlicer II, FrightSpear and Kiss The Blade, the 
suit announced as the car slowed again and the bulbous black bulks 
of the craft blotted out the stars. 

~ Charmed, I'm sure, thought Genar-Hofoen, picking up his hold-
all.  He studied the hulls of the three warships, looking for the signs 
of damage that would indicate the craft were veterans.  The signs 
were there; a delicate tracery of curved lines, light grey on dark grey 
and black, spread out across the spines, blades and curtain hull of 
the middle ship indicated a probably glancing blow from a plasma 
blast (which even Genar-Hofoen, who found weapons boring, could 
recognise); blurred grey roundels like concentric bruises on that 
middle ship and the nearest vessel were the marks of another weapon 

system, and sharp, straight lines etched across the various surfaces 
of the third craft looked like the effects of yet another. 

Of course, the Affront's ships were as self-repairing as any other 
reasonably advanced civilisation's, and the marks that had been left 
on the vessels were just that; they would be no thicker than a coat 
of paint and have negligible effect on the ships' operational 
capability.  However, the Affront thought that it was only right that 
their ships should - like themselves - bear the scars of honour that 
battle brings, and so allowed their warships' self-repair mechanisms 
to stop just short of perfection, the better to display the provenance 
of their war fleets' glorious reputations. 

The car stopped directly underneath the middle warcraft in the midst 
of a forest of giant pipes and tubes which disappeared into the belly 
of the ship.  Crunches, thumps and hisses from outside the car 
announced all was being made safe.  A wisp of vapour burst from a 
seal, and the car's door swung out and up.  There was a corridor 
beyond.  An honour guard of Affronters jerked to attention; not for 
him, of course, but for Fivetide and the Affronter at his side dressed 
in the uniform of a Navy Commander.  Both of them were half 
floating, half walking along towards him, paddles rowing and dangling 
limbs pushing. 

'And here's our guest!' Fivetide shouted. 'Genar-Hofoen; allow me to 
present Commander Kindrummer VI of both the Blades-corner tribe 
and the Battle-Cruiser Kiss The Blade. So, human; ready for our little 
jaunt?' 

'Yup,' he said, and stepped out into the corridor. 

IV 

Ulver Seich, barely twenty-two, famed scholastic overachiever since 
the age of three, voted Most Luscious Student by her last five 
University years and breaker of more hearts on Phage Rock than 
anybody since her legendary great-great-great grandmother, had 
been summarily dragged away from her graduation ball by the drone 
Churt Lyne. 

'Churt!' she said, balling her fists in her long black gloves and nodding 
her head forward; her high heels clicked along the inlaid wood of the 
vestibule floor. 'How dare you; that was a deeply lovely young man I 
was dancing with!  He was utterly, utterly gorgeous; how could you 
just drag me away like that?' 

The drone, hurrying at her back, dived round in front of her and 
opened the ancient, manually operated double doors leading from the 
ballroom vestibule, its suitcase-sized body rustling against the bustle 
of her gown as it did so. 'I'm sorry beyond words, Ulver,' it told her. 
'Now, please let's not delay.' 

'Mind my bustle,' she said. 

'Sorry.' 

'He was gorgeous,'' Ulver Seich said vehemently as she strode down 
a stone-flagged hallway lined with paintings and urn plants, following 
the floating drone as it headed for the traveltube doors. 

'I'll take your word for it,' it said. 

'And he liked my legs,' she said, looking down at the slashed front of 
the gown.  Her long, exposed legs were sheathed in sheer 
blackness.  Violet shoes matched her deep-cut gown; its short train 
hurried after her in quick, sinuous flicks. 

'They're beautiful legs,' the drone agreed, signalling ahead to the 
traveltube controls to hurry things up. 

'Damn right they are,' she said.  She shook her head. 'He was 
gorgeous.' 

'I'm sure.' 

She stopped abruptly. 'I'm going back.' She turned on her heel, just 
a little unsteadily. 

'What?' yelped Churt Lyne.  The drone darted round in front of her; 
she almost bumped into it. 'Ulver!' the machine said, sounding 
angry.  Its aura field flashed white. 'Really!' 

'Get out the way.  He was gorgeous.  He's mine.  He deserves 
me.  Come on; shift.' 

It wouldn't get out of the way.  She balled her fists again and beat at 
its snout, stamping her feet.  She hiccuped. 

'Ulver, Ulver,' the drone said, gently taking her hands in its 
fields.  She stuck her head forward and frowned as hard as she could 
at the machine's front sensory band. 'Ulver,' it said again. 
'Please.  Please listen; this is-' 

'What is it, anyway?' she cried. 

'I told you; something you have to see; a signal.' 

'Well, why can't you show it to me here? She looked round the 
hallway, at the softly lit portraits and the variegated fronds, creepers 
and parasols of the urn plants. 'There isn't even anybody else 
around!' 

'Because it just doesn't work that way,' Churt Lyne said, sounding 
exasperated. 'Ulver, please; this is important.  You still want to join 
Contact?' 

She sighed. 'I suppose so,' she said, rolling her eyes. 'Join Contact 
and go exploring…' 

'Well, this is your invitation.' It let go of her hands. 

She stuck her head forward at it again.  Her hair was an artful tangle 
of masked black curls studded with tiny helium-filled globes of gold, 
platinum and emerald.  It brushed against the drone's snout like a 
particularly decorative thundercloud. 

'Will it let me go exploring on that young man?' she asked, trying to 
keep her face straight. 

'Ulver, if you will just do as I ask there is every chance Contact will 
happily provide you with entire ships full of gorgeous young 
men.  Now, please turn round.' 

She snorted derisively and went on tip-toes to look wobblingly over 
the machine's casing in the direction of the ballroom.  She could still 
hear the music of the dance she'd left. 'Yeah, but it was that one I 
was interested in…' 

The drone took her hands again in fields coloured yellow green with 
calm friendliness, bringing her down off her toes. 'Young lady,' it said. 
'I shall never say anything more truthful to you than these two 
things.  One; there will be plenty more gorgeous young men in your 
life.  Two; you will never have a better chance of getting into Contact, 
even Special Circumstances, and with them owing you a favour; or 
two.  Do you understand?  This is your big chance, girl.' 

'Don't you "girl" me,' she told it sniffily.  The drone Churt Lyne had 
been a family friend for nearly a millennium and parts of its 
personality were supposed to date back to when they'd been 
programs in a house-systems computer nine thousand years 
earlier.  It wasn't in the habit of pulling age on her like this and 
reminding her that she was a mere day-fly to its creakingly venerable 
antiquity, but it wasn't above doing so when it thought the situation 
demanded it, either.  She closed one eye and looked closely at the 
machine. 'Did you say "Special Circumstances" just there?' 

'Yes.' 

She drew back. 'Hmm,' she said, her eyes narrowing. 

Behind her, the traveltube chimed and the door rolled open.  She 
turned and started walking towards it. 'Well, come on, then!' she said 
over her shoulder. 

vacuum and flooded with air, it had been spun to provide artificial 
gravity and it had become a habitat orbiting its parent sun. 

Later, when the technology made it possible and the political 
conditions prevailing at the time made it advisable to quit that 
system, it had been fitted with fusion-powered steam rockets and ion 
engines to help propel it into interstellar space.  Again due to those 
political conditions, it armed itself with up-rated signal lasers and a 
number of at least partially targetable mass launchers which doubled 
as rail guns.  Some years later, scarred but intact, and finally 
accepted as personally sentient by its human inhabitants, it had been 
one of the first space-based entities to declare for the new pan-
civilisational, pan-species grouping which was calling itself the 
Culture. 

Over the years, decades, centuries and millennia that had folεlowed, 
Phage had journeyed through the galaxy, wandering from system to 
system, concentrating on trading and manufacturing at first and then 
on a gradually more cultural, educatory role as the advances in 
technology the Culture was cultivating began to distribute the 
society's productive capacity so evenly throughout its fabric that the 
ability 
to 
manufacture 
almost 
anything 
developed 
almost 

everywhere, and trade became relatively rare. 

And Phage Rock - by now recognised as one of a distinct category of 
Culture artifacts which were neither ships nor worlds but something 
in between - had grown, accruing new bits of systemic or interstellar 
debris about it as its needs required and its population increased, 
securing the chunks of metal, rock, ice and compacted dust to its still 
gnarled outer surface in a slow process of acquisition, consumption 
and evolution, so that within just a millennium of its transition from 
mine to habitat its earlier, original self wouldn't have recognised it; it 
was thirty kilometres long by then, not three, and only the front half 
of that initial body still peeped out from the prow of the knobbly 
collection of equipment-scattered mountains and expanded, balloon-
like hangar and accommodation rotundae that now formed its roughly 
conical body. 

Phage Rock's rate of accretion had slowed after that, and it was now 
just over seventy kilometres long and home to one hundred and fifty 

million people.  It looked like a collection of craggy rocks, smooth 
stones and still smoother shells brought from a beach and cemented 
into a rough cairn, all dotted with what looked like a museum 
collection of Culture Equipment Through the Ages: launch pads, radar 
pits, aerial frames, sensory arrays, telescope dishes, rail-gun pylons, 
crater-like rocket nozzles, clamshell hangar doors, iris apertures and 
a bewildering variety of domes large and small, intact and part-
dismantled or just ruined. 

As its size and its population had grown, so had the speeds Phage 
Rock was capable of.  It had been successively fitted with ever-more 
efficient and powerful drives and engines, until eventually it was able 
to maintain a perfectly respectable velocity either warping along the 
fabric of space-time or creating its own induced-singularity pathway 
through hyperspace beneath or above it. 

Ulver Seich's had been one of the Rock's Founding Families; she could 
trace her ancestry back through fifty-four generations on Phage itself 
and numbered amongst her ancestors at least two forebears who 
were inevitably mentioned in even one-volume Histories of the 
Culture, as well as being descended from - as the fashions of the 
intervening times had ordained - people who had resembled birds, 
fish, dirigible balloons, snakes, small clouds of cohesive smoke and 
animated bushes. 

The tenor of the time had generally turned against such 
outlandishness and people had mostly returned to looking more like 
people over the last millennium, albeit assuredly pretty good-looking 
people, but still, some part of one's appearance was initially at least 
left to luck and the random nature of genetic inheritance, and it was 
a matter of some pride to Ulver that she had never had any form of 
physical alteration carried out (well, apart from the neural lace of 
course, but that didn't count).  It would have been a brave or 
deranged human or machine who told Ulver Seich to her face that the 
give-or-take-a-bit human-basic form was not almost unimprovably 
graceful and alluring, especially in its female state, and even more 
especially when it was called Ulver Seich. 

She looked round the room the drone had brought her to.  It was 
semicircular and moderately big, shaped like an auditorium or a 
shallowly sloped lecture hall, but most of the steps or seats seemed 
to be filled with complicated-looking desks and pieces of 
equipment.  A huge screen filled the far wall. 

They'd entered the room through a long tunnel which she'd never 
seen before and which was blocked by a series of thick, mirror-coated 
doors which had rolled silently back into recesses as they'd 
approached, and revolved back into place behind them once they'd 
passed.  Ulver had admired her reflection in every one of them, and 
drawn herself up even straighter in her spectacular violet gown. 

The lights had come on in the semicircular room as the last door had 
rolled back into place.  The place was bright, but dusty.  The drone 
whooshed off to one side and hovered over one of the desks. 

Ulver stood looking round the space, wondering.  She sneezed. 

'Bless you.' 

'Thank you.  What is this place, Churt?' she asked. 

'Emergency Centre Command Space,' the drone told her, as the desk 
beneath it lit up in places and various panes and panels of light leapt 
up to waver in the air above its surface. 

Ulver Seich wandered over to look at the pretty displays. 

'Didn't even know this place existed,' she said, drawing one black-
gloved finger along the desk's surface.  The displays altered and the 
desk made a chirping noise; Churt Lyne slapped her hand away, 
going 'tssk' while its aura field flashed white.  She glowered at the 
machine, inspected the grey rim of dust on her finger tip, and 
smeared it on the casing of the drone. 

Normally Churt Lyne would have slicked that part of its body with a 
field and the dust would just have fallen off, having literally nothing 
to cling to, but this time it ignored her and just kept on hovering over 

the desk and its rapidly changing displays, obviously controlling both 
it and them.  Ulver crossed her black-gloved arms in annoyance. 

The sliding panels of lights hanging in the air changed and rotated; 
figures and letters slid across their surfaces.  Then they all 
disappeared. 

'Right,' the drone said.  A maniple field coloured formal blue extended 
from the machine's casing and dragged a small sculpted metal seat 
over, placing it behind her and then shoving it quickly forward; she 
had no choice but to plonk down into it. 

'Ow,' she said, pointedly.  She adjusted her bustle and glared at the 
drone but it still wasn't paying attention. 

'Here we go,' it said. 

What looked like a pane of brown smoked glass suddenly leapt into 
existence above the desk.  She studied it, attempting to see her 
reflection. 

'Ready?' the drone asked her. 

'Mm-hmm,' she said. 

'Ulver, child,' the drone said, in a voice she knew it had spent 
centuries investing with gravitas.  It swivelled through the air until it 
was directly in front of her. 

She rolled her eyes. 'Yes?  What?' 

'Ulver, I know you're a little-' 

'I'm drunk, drone, I know,' she told it. 'But I haven't lost my wits.' 

'Well, good, but I need to know you're fit to make this decision.  What 
you're about to see might change your life.' 

She sighed and put her gloved elbow on the surface of the desk, 
resting her chin on her hand. 'I've had a few young fellows tell me 

that before,' she drawled. 'It always turns out to be a disappointment, 
or a joke of the grossest nature.' 

'This is neither.  But you must understand that just seeing what I'm 
about to show you might give Special Circumstances an interest in 
you that will not pass; even if you decide you don't want to join 
Contact, or even if you do but you're still refused, it is possible they 
might watch you for the rest of your life, just because of what you're 
about to see.  I'm sorry to sound so melodramatic, but I don't want 
you to enter into anything you don't understand the full implications 
of.' 

'Me neither.' She yawned. 'Can we get on with this?' 

'You're sure you've understood what I've said?' 

'Hell yes!' she exclaimed, waving her arms around. 'Just get on with 
it.' 

'Oh; just one other thing-' 

'What?' she yelled. 

'Will you travel to a distant location in the guise of somebody else and 
- probably - help kidnap somebody, another Culture citizen?' 

'Will I what?' she said, wrinkling her nose and snorting with laughter 
and disbelief. 

'Sounds like a "No" to me,' the drone said. 'Didn't think you 
would.  Had to ask though.  That means I have no choice but to show 
you this.' It sounded relieved. 

She put both her black-gloved arms on the desk, rested her chin on 
them and looked as soberly as she could at the drone. 'Churt,' she 
said. 'What is going on here?' 

'You'll see,' it told her, getting out of the way of the screen. 'You 
ready?' 

'If I get any more ready I'll be asleep.' 

'Good.  Pay attention.' 

'Oh yes, sir,' she said, glancing narrow-eyed at the machine. 

'Watch!' it said. 

She sat back in the seat with her arms folded.

'Sorry,' she said.  Ulver Seich shook her head slowly at the text 
hanging in the air in front of her and the drone Churt Lyne.  She took 
a deep breath.  Suddenly, she felt quite entirely sober. 'Is this as 
important as I think it is?' 

'Almost certainly much more so.' 

'Oh,' she said, 'fuck.' 

'Indeed,' the drone replied. 'Any other questions so far?' 

She looked at the last word of the GCU's main signal: 

'Questions…' Ulver Seich said, staring at the holo screen and blowing 
her cheeks out.  She turned to the drone, her violet ball gown 
rustling. 'Lots.  First, what are we really…?  No; hold on.  Just take 
me through the signal.  Never mind all the translations or whatever; 
what's it actually saying?' 

'The General Contact Unit issues an excession notice through its home 
General Systems Vehicle,' the drone told her, 'but it's prevented from 
being broadcast by another GSV which the first one obviously 
contacted before doing anything.  The GCU tells us that its sensors 
clipped this artifact, which then hailed the GCU using an old Elench 
greeting and an even older Galactic Common Language; then the 
GCU spends a great deal of the signal detailing how clever it was 
pretending that it's slower, not as manoeuvrable and less well 
equipped in the sensor department than actually it is.  It describes 
the object and a few surrounding bits and pieces of debris which imply 
there was some sort of small-scale military action there fifty-three 
days earlier, then it assures it's well and unviolated but it's ready to 
blow itself up, or let somebody else blow it up if its integrity is 
threatened… not a step a GCU takes lightly. 

'However, entirely the most important aspect of the signal is that the 
object it has discovered is linked to the energy grid in both 
hyperspatial directions; that alone puts it well outside all known 
parameters and precedents.  We have no previous experience 
whatsoever with something like this; it's unique; beyond our 
ken.  I'm not surprised the GCU is scared.' 

'Okay, okay, that's kind of what I thought; shit.' She belched 
delicately. 'Excuse me.' 

'Of course.' 

'Now, like I was going to say; what are we really dealing with here; 
an excession, or something else?' 

'Well, if you take the definition of an excession as anything external 
to the Culture that we should be worried about, this is an excession 
all right.  On the other hand, if you compare it to the average - or 
even an exceptional - Hegemonising Swarm, it's small, localised, non-
invasive, unaggressive, unshielded, immobile… and almost chatty, 
using Galin II to communicate.' The drone paused. 'The crucial 
characteristic then remains the fact that the thing's linked to the 
energy grid, both up and down. That's interesting, to put it mildly, 
because as far as we know, nobody knows how to do that.  Well, 
nobody apart from the Elder civilisations… probably; they won't say 
and we can't tell.' 

'So this thing can do something the Culture can't?' 

'Looks like it.' 

'And I take it the Culture would like to be able to do what it can do.' 

'Oh, yes.  Yes, very much so.  Or, even if it couldn't partake of the 
technology, at least it would like to use the implied opportunity the 
excession may represent.' 

'To do what?' 

'Wehhll,' Churt Lyne said, drawing the word out while its aura-field 
coloured with embarrassment and its body wobbled in the air, 
'technically - maybe - the ability to travel - easily - to other 
universes.' The machine paused again, looking at the human and 
waiting for her sarcastic reply.  When she didn't say anything, it 
continued. 'It should be possible to step outside the time-strand of 
our universe as easily as a ship steps outside the space-time 
fabric.  It might then become feasible to travel through superior 
hyperspace upwards to universes older than ours, or through inferior 
hyperspace downwards to universes younger than our own.' 

'Time travel?' 

'No, but affording the opportunity to become time proof.  Age 
proof.  In theory, one might become able to step down consecutively 
through earlier universes… well, forever.' 

'Forever?' 

'Real forever, as far as we understand it.  You could choose the size 
and therefore age of the universe you wanted to remain within, 
and/or visit as many as you wanted.  You could, for example, head 
on up through older universes and attempt to access technologies 
perhaps beyond even this one.  But just as interesting is the point 
that because you wouldn't be tied to one universe, one time stream, 
you need be involved in no heat death when the time came in your 
original universe; or no evaporation, or no big crunch, depending. 

'It's like being on an escalator.  At the moment, confined to this 
universe, we're stuck to this stair, this level; the possibility this 
artifact appears to offer is that of being able to step from one stair to 
another, so that before your stair on the escalator comes to the end 
of its travel - heat-death, big crunch, whatever - you just step off one 
level down to another.  You could, in effect, live for ever… well, unless 
it's discovered that cosmic fireball engines themselves have a life-
cycle; as I understand it the metamath on that implies but does not 
guarantee perpetuity.' 

Seich looked at the drone for a while, her brows furrowed. 'Haven't 
we ever found anything like this before?' 

'Not really.  There are ambiguous reports of vaguely similar entities 
turning up in the past - though they tend to disappear before anybody 
can fully investigate - but as far as we know, nobody has ever found 
anything quite like this before.' 

The human was silent for a while.  Then she said, 'If you could access 
any universe, and go back to one universe at a very early, pre-
sentience stage with an already highly developed civilisation…' 

'You could take over the whole thing,' the drone confirmed. 'An entire 
universe would be yours alone.  In fact, go back far enough - that is, 
to a small enough, early enough, just-post-singularity universe - and 
you could, conceivably, customise it; mould it, shape it, influence its 
primary characteristics.  Admittedly, that sort of control may well 
remain in the realm of the fantastic, but it might be possible.' 

Ulver Seich drew a deep breath, and, looking at the floor, nodded 
slowly.'… And of course,' she said, 'if this thing is what it appears to 
be, it could be an exit, as well as an entrance.' 

'Entirely so; it is almost certainly both at once.  As you imply; never 
mind us getting into it, we don't know what might come out of it.' 

Ulver Seich nodded slowly. '… Holy shit,' she said. 

'Let's call up the comments,' Churt Lyne suggested. 

'Can we miss out the preparatory junk at the start?' 

'Allow me.  There.' 

'As you wish.'

Group (Crisis Preparatory Foresight Sub-Committee, Occasional), we 
(in multiεple mode) have assumed the management of this situation

1.1 The following constitute our introductory remarks. 

2.0 Might we first beg to record that it goes without saying that we 
are not only extremely flattered but also deeply humbled to be placed 
in a position of such importance on the occasion of this grave, 
profound and indeed one might even say momentous circumstance. 

'Want me to ask somebody?' 

'Yeah, I'm sure we'd get a straight answer to that one.' 

'Just so.' 

'Hmm.  Meanwhile the bullshit rolls on.' 

'Three-Mind grouping, usually.' 

'That's why it's saying everything in triplicate…' 

3.2 Under the terms of the Temporary Emergencies (Allowed

Right.  First, this should not be kept secret, even for a limited time.  I 
object in the strongest possible terms to the fact that the instant we 
stumble over possibly the most important thing anybody's ever found 
anywhere ever, the first thing SC does is snap into Full-Scale Raving 
Paranoia mode and apply this M32 total-secrecy-or-we'll-pull-your-
plugs-out-baby shit.  I've given my word and I'm not going to leak 
this, but for the record, I believe we should be telling everybody. 
(Let's face it, we'll probably have to well before this unrealistic time-
limit of 128 days, anyway.) 

That said, if we are going to keep this to ourselves for the time being, 
might I anticipate SC's all-too-predictable reaction and draw 
everyone's attention to a study by the Added Value [text and details 
attached] which basically says if you surround something like this 
with a mega-fleet and it isn't quite omnipotent, just staggeringly 
powerful and fully invasive, you're basically giving it an immense, 
ready-made war-fleet to play with, if it is hostile.  Just a thought. 

oo 

x Tactical 
Grace (GCU, 
Escarpment 
Class): 

I agree absolutely with the above and endorse the Added 
Value study. 

Let us not thoughtlessly get cannoned up on this one. 

oo 

x Woetra (Orbital 
Hub, 
Schiparse-Oevyli 
system, 
[solo]): 

  Some sadness reigns.  We may approach the end of our knowing 
Naïvety.  Draw round (the fire, growing dim, draws too, drawing in 
its breath for one fine final burst of flame).  Potentially an end of 
innocence, we face this, glancing backwards.  Within the horizon of 
our mutual import, an end and start to Meaning (finally 
beginning).  Ancients (knowing so little) would have half expected, 

partly welcomed what we all fear this might be.  We (knowing all too 
much) would rather deny its untold implications.  Ephemera, they 
were half happy with and wholly used to the possibility of an End.  By 
their knowing Immortal, we tremble before the same.  My friends, if 
we have ever worshipped anything, it has been the great god Chaos. 
(What else shields Intelligence from the awful implications of utter 
Omniscience?) Might we be looking at our god's Deiclast? 

oo 

x Steely 
Glint (GCV, 
Plains 
Class): 

Remarkable.  One hears nothing for years then suddenly… well, 
anyway. Pace the Added Value study mentioned above, I propose the 
immediate and complete remilitarisation of all viable units to within - 
say - sixty-four days' rush-in distance.  Not so much because we 
might need to fight the Taussig Matter itself but because this Event 
will undoubtedly not stay secret for very long and will - with equal 
certitude - attract an entire cast of terminological Civiliseds of the 
distinctly Undesirable persuasion.  Serious up-cannoning on our part, 
for all its intrinsic vulgarity and first-principle undesirability, may be 
the only way to prevent scalar inter-civilisation conflicts which, at 
worst, might overshadow the entail of the Matter itself.

I suggest firstly that we rid ourselves of this ridiculous 'Taussig' 
nonsense and call the matter after Esperi, the nearest star; I also 
propose that between eight and sixteen days from now - depending 
on the availability of more noteworthy news from elsewhere - we 
move to an information release at M16-level, simply saying that we 
have discovered an excession of an ambiguous nature, which we are 
investigating and which we are asking others to stay away 
from.  Assuming that they will not, we should request the Steely 
Glint to instigate a measured and localised military mobilisation, 
immediately.  Beyond that, the normal democratic processes will 
doubtless apply.

Abhorrent as I'm sure we all find such ploys, I suspect that the extra

from this becoming public.

As the Not Invented Here is the closest major unit to the matter I 
suggest it makes all speed for the location of the Excession and acts 
as incident coordinator.  I myself am not too far away from the Esperi 
system; I shall make my way there and rendezvous with the Not

oo

I also submit that the GSV Ethics Gradient and the GCU Fate

to hold back from full investigation of the Excession until further

'… Good grief, Ulver,' the drone said, giving a fair impression of 
spluttering. 'It's the Heavy Crew!  It's the Ghosts!' 

'What?  The who?' She swivelled in the seat to face the drone. 

'Child, 
there 
were 
names 
appearing 
there 
I 
hadn't 
seen 

for five centuries. Some of those Minds are legends!' 

'This is the Interesting Times Gang we're talking about, I take it?' 

'That's obviously what they call themselves.' 

'Well, good for them, but I still want to know what all that was about.' 

'Well, a normal enough but pretty high-power Mind Incident Group 
gets together to discuss what's going on, then - allowing for signal 
travel duration - within real-time seconds it's taken over by probably 
the most respected not to mention enigmatic group of Minds ever 
assembled together in the same signal sequence since the end of the 
Idiran War.' 

'You don't say,' Ulver said, yawning a little and putting one black-
gloved hand over her mouth. 

'Yes; in the case of the Not Invented Here, everybody I know thought 
the thing had been lost half a millennium ago!  Then they dump the 
boring, pedantic GSV that happened to be on the Incident 
Coordinating Rota, agree to wait-and-see with the Excession itself 
while sending investigatory reinforcements, start a localised 
mobilisation - mobilisation! - and release a half-truth about the 
Excession when there's some more exciting news breaking.' 

Ulver frowned. 'When did all this happen?' 

'Well, if you hadn't turned off the date/time function…' muttered the 
drone, colouring frosty blue.  Ulver rolled her eyes again. 'The 
Excession was discovered and that signal sequence plus comments 
dates from twelve days ago.  The Excession's discovery was 
announced through the standard channels the day before yesterday.' 

The human shrugged. 'I missed it.' 

'The headlines concerned the resolution of the Blitteringueh 
situation.' 

'Ah-hah.  That would do it, I suppose.' 

Most of the developed galaxy had been following that story for the 
past hundred days, as the aftermath of the short but bitter 
Blitteringueh-Deluger War played itself out on the CAM-bomb-mined 
Blitteringueh home planets and the Deluger fleets fleeing with their 
precious holy relics and Grand House captives.  It had ended with 
relatively little loss of life, but in high drama, and with continuing, 
developing repercussions; little wonder anything else announced that 
day had slipped by almost unnoticed and stayed that way. 

'And what was that thing towards the end there, about "Calling our 
mutual friend"?' 

'That'll probably turn out to be something to do with inviting some 
other Mind onto the group.' The drone was silent for a moment. 
'Though of course it could be some pre-agreed form of words, a secret 
signal amongst the group.' 

Seich stared at the drone. 'A secret signal?' she said. 'In an M32-level 
transmission?' 

'It's possible; no more.' 

Seich continued to stare at the machine for a moment. 'You're saying 
that these Minds are discussing something… agreeing to something 
that's so sensitive, so secret they won't even talk about it in Special 
Circumstances' top-end code, the fucking holy of holies, the 
unbreakable, inviolable, totally secure M32?' 

'No I'm not. I'm just saying it's… semi-possible.' The drone's aura 
field flickered grey with frustration. 'In that event, though, I don't 
think it would be breakability they'd be worried about.' 

'What then?' Seich's eyes narrowed. 'Deniability?' 

'If we're thinking in such paranoid terms in the first place, yes, that'd 
be my guess,' the drone said, dipping its front once in a nod and 
making a noise like a sigh. 

'So they're up to something.' 

'Well, they're up to a lot, by the sound of it.  But it's just possible that 
some part of what they're up to might be, well, risky.' 

Ulver Seich sat back, staring at the empty square of the projected 
screen, hanging in the air in front of her and the drone Churt Lyne 
like a pane of slightly opaque smoked glass. 'Risky,' she said.  She 
shook her head and felt a strange urge to shiver, which she 
suppressed. 'Shit, don't you hate it when the Gods come out to play?' 

'In a word,' said the drone, 'yes.' 

'So what am I supposed to do?  And why?' 

'You're supposed to look like this woman,' the drone said, as a bright, 
still picture flashed on to the smoky screen in front of her. 

Ulver studied the face, chin in her hand again. 'Hmm,' she said. 'She's 
older than me.' 

'True.' 

'And not as pretty.' 

'Fair enough.' 

'Why do I have to look like her?' 

'To draw the attention of a certain man.' 

She narrowed her eyes. 'Wait a minute; I'm not expected to fuck this 
guy, am I?' 

'Oh good grief, no,' the drone said, its aura field briefly grey again. 
'All you have to do is look like an old flame of his.' 

She laughed. 'I bet I am expected to fuck him!' She rocked back in 
the little metal seat. 'How quaint!  Is this really what SC gets up to?' 

'No you're not,' hissed the drone, aura fields going deep grey. 'You 
just have to be there.' 

'I'll bet,' she guffawed, and sat back, crossing her arms. 'So who is 
he, anyway?' 

'Him,' the drone said.  Another still face appeared on the screen. 

Ulver Seich sat forward again, raising one hand. 'Hold on.  I take it 
all back; actually he's pretty enticing…' 

The drone made a sighing noise. 'Ulver, if you will please try to hold 
your hormones in check for just a second…' 

'What?' she shouted, spreading her arms. 

'Will you do this or not?' it asked her. 

She closed one eye and wobbled her head from side to side. 'Maybe,' 
she slurred. 

'It means a trip,' the drone said. 'Leaving tonight-' 

'Pah!' She sat back, crossing her arms and looking up at the ceiling. 
'Out of the question.  Forget it.' 

'All right; tomorrow.' 

She turned to the drone. 'After lunch.' 

'Breakfast.' 

'Late breakfast.' 

'Oh,' the machine said, aura field briefly grey with frustration. 'All 
right.  Late breakfast.  But before noon, in any event.' 

Ulver opened her mouth to protest, then gave a tiny shrug and settled 
for scowling. 'Okay.  How long for?' 

'You'll be back in a month, if all goes well.' 

She tipped her head back, narrowed her eyes again and said quite 
soberly and precisely, 'Where?' 

The drone said, 'Tier.' 

'Huh,' she said, tossing her head. 

A sore point; Phage had been heading to Tier specifically for that 
year's Festival but had been diverted off course to help build an 
Orbital after the part-evacuation of some stupid planet; it had taken 
forever.  The Festival only lasted a month and was now almost over; 
the Rock was still heading that way but wouldn't arrive for two 
hundred days or so. 

She frowned. 'But that's a couple of months away even on a fast ship.' 

'Special Circumstances has its own ships and they're faster; ten days 
to get there on the one they're giving you.' 

'My own ship?' Ulver asked, eyes flashing. 

'All yours; not even any human crew.' 

'Wow!' she said, sitting back and looking pleased with herself. 'Aloof!'

II 

The drone Sisela Ytheleus 1/2 drifted, waiting.  Several seconds had 
passed since the skein pulse had resonated around it and it was still 
trying to decide what to do.  It had passed the time by throwing 
together the anti-matter reaction chamber as best it could in the short 
time available, instead of painstakingly putting it together bit by 
delicate bit.  As an after-thought, it released all but one of its 
nanomissiles and stuck two hundred of them around its heat-scarred 
rear panel in two groups on either side of the reaction chamber; 
fortuitously, the panel's damaged surface made it easy for it to embed 
the tiny missiles so that only the last third of their millimetre-long 
bodies protruded from the panel.  It kept the other thirty-nine 
missiles ready to fire, for all the good that would do against whatever 
it was stalking it. 

The gentle, buzzing vibrations in the skein had taken on a distinctive 
signature; something was coming towards it in hyperspace, with a 
sensory 
keel 
in 
real 
space, 
trawling 
slowly, 
well 
below 

lightspeed.  Whatever it was, it was not the Peace Makes Plenty; the 
timbral characteristics were all wrong. 

A wash of wide-band radiation, like a sourceless light, a final pulse of 
maser energies, in real space this time, and then something 

shimmering away to one side; a ship surfacing into the three-
dimensional void, image flickering once then snapping steady. 

Ten kilometres away; one klick long.  Matched velocity.  A fat, grey-
black ellipsoid shape, covered with sharp spines, barbs and blades… 

An Affronter ship! 

The drone hesitated.  Could this have been the ship that had been 
following the Peace Makes Plenty! Probably.  Had it been taken over 
by the artifact/excession?  Possibly.  Not that it mattered in the 
end. Shit. 

The Affront; no friends of the Elench.  Or anybody else, for that 
matter. I've failed.  They'll reel me in, gobble me up. 

The drone tried desperately to work out what it could do.  Did the fact 
it was an Affronter ship make any real difference?  Doubtful.  Should 
it signal it, try to get it to help?  It could try; the Affront were 
signatories to the standard conventions on ships and individuals in 
distress and in theory they ought to take the drone aboard, help 
repair it and broadcast a warning about the artifact to the rest of the 
galaxy. 

In practice they would take the drone to bits to find out how it worked, 
drain it of all its information, ransom it if they hadn't destroyed it in 
the process of investigation and inquisition, probably try to put a spy-
program into it so that it would report back to them once it was back 
amongst the Elench, and meanwhile try to work out how they could 
use the artifact/excession, perhaps being foolhardy enough to 
attempt investigating it in the same final, fatal way the Peace Makes 
Plenty had, or perhaps keeping it secret for now and bringing more 
ships and technology to bear upon it.  Almost certainly the one thing 
they wouldn't do was play the situation by the book. 

EM effector; communicating.  Sisela Ytheleus 1/2 readied its shields, 
for as much as that was worth; probably delay proceedings by, oh, a 
good nanosecond if the Affronter ship decided to attack it… 

~ Machine!  What are you? 

(Well, that was spoken like an Affronter, certainly; it'd bet they hadn't 
tangled with the artifact/excession yet.  Oh well.  Play it by the 
conventions:) 

~ I am Sisela Ytheleus 1/2, drone of the Explorer Ship Peace Makes 
Plenty, a vessel of the Stargazer Clan, part of the Fifth Fleet of the 
Zetetic Elench, and in distress, it communicated. ~ And you? 

~ You are ours now.  Surrender or take flight! 

(Definitely still 100% Affront.) 

~ Sorry, I missed that.  What did you say your name was again? 

~ Surrender at once or take flight, wretch! 

~ Let me think about that. 

(And thinking was exactly what it was doing; thinking hard, thinking 
feverishly.  Stalling for time, but thinking.) 

~ No! 

The effector signal strength started to soar exponentially.  It had 
plenty of time to slam down its shields. 

Bastards, it thought. Of course; they like a chase… 

The drone fired the missiles embedded in its rear panel; the two 
hundred tiny engines brought unequal amounts of matter and anti-
matter together and threw the resulting blast of plasma boiling into 
the vacuum, careening the machine away across space directly away 
from the Affronter craft.  The acceleration was relatively mild.  The 
drone had no time to test the anti-matter reaction chamber it had 
constructed; it threw a few particles of each sort into the chamber 
and hoped.  The chamber blew up. Shit; back to the drawing board. 

Not much damage - not much extra damage, anyway - but not much 
extra impetus either, and it wouldn't be using the chamber 
again.  The acceleration went on, building slowly. What else?  Think 
! 

The Affronter ship didn't bother to set off in pursuit of the drone; 
Sisela Ytheleus 1/2 dropped its plan of leaving a few nanomissiles 
scattered like mines behind it. (Who am I trying to kid, 
anyway?  Think; think!) 

Space seemed to buckle and twist in front of it, and suddenly it was 
no longer heading straight away from the Affronter ship; it was 
parallel to it again. Those animal pus-bags are playing with me! 

A flicker from near the Affronter ship's nose.  A centimetre-diameter 
circle of laser light blinked onto the drone's casing and wavered 
there.  The drone instructed the nanomissile engines to shut off and 
flicked on its mirror shields; the laser beam tracked it unsteadily and 
narrowed until it was a millimetre in diameter, then its power 
suddenly leapt by seven orders of magnitude.  The drone coned its 
protesting mirrorfield and turned rear-on to the ship again, 
presenting the smallest possible target.  The laser modulated, 
stepping up to the ultraviolet.  It started strobing. 

Playing with me, just fucking playing with me… (Think!  Think!) 

Well, first… 

It popped the clamps around its two upper-level minds and raised the 
bit of its casing that would let the two components -AI core and 
photonic nucleus - free.  The casing shuddered and grated, but it 
moved.  Once it was clear of the main casing, the drone nudged the 
two 
mind 
components 
with 
its 
maniple 
field.  Nothing 

happened.  They were stuck. 

Panic!  If they remained intact and the Affronters captured them and 
weren't a great deal more careful than they were notorious for being… 
It pushed harder; the components duly drifted out, losing power the 
instant contact lapsed with the drone's body.  Whatever was inside 
them should be dead or dying now.  It blasted them with its laser 
anyway, turning them into hot dust, then vented the powder behind 
it round the edge of the mirrorshield, where it might interfere with 
the laser a little.  A very little. 

It readied the core inside its present substrate; that would have to 
be dumped and lasered too. 

Then the drone had an idea. 

It thought about it.  If it had been a human, its mouth would have 
gone dry. 

It turned round inside the tight confines of its pummelled shield and 
fired all two hundred of the nanomissile engines.  It shook off the 
remaining loose nanomissiles and fired thirty of them straight at the 
Affronter ship.  The other nine it left tumbling behind it like a handful 
of tiny black-body needle-tips, with their own instructions and the 
small amount of spare capacity in their microscopic brains packed 
with coded nonsense. 

The nanomissiles fired at the Affronter ship accelerated towards it in 
a cloud of sparkling light ahead of the drone; they were picked off, 
one by one, over the course of a millisecond, in a dizzy flaring scatter 
of light-blossoms, their tiny warheads and the remains of their anti-
matter fuel erupting together; the last one to be targeted by the 
Affronter's effector and forced to self-destruct had closed the range 
to the ship by less than a kilometre. 

Behind, all nine of the tumbling nanomissiles must have been picked 
out by the effector as well, because they detonated too. 

And with any luck you'll think those were my messages in bottles 
and that was my neat idea, Sisela Ytheleus 1/2 thought, decoupling 
the 
core 
with 
its 
twin's 
mind-state 
in 
it.  The 
core 
de-

powered.  Whatever was in there died.  It had no time to mourn; it 
rearranged its internal state to shunt the core to the outside, then let 
its body settle back to normal.  It pushed the core back down over its 
blistered, cracked casing, to the top of the rear panel, near where the 
wreckage of the cobbled-together and blown-apart reaction chamber 
hung, then it let the core fall into the livid plasma and sleeting 
radiation of the nanomissiles' exhausts; it flared and disintegrated, 
falling astern in a bright trail of fire. 

The laser targeted on the drone was heading into the X-ray part of 
the spectrum; it would break through the mirror shield in a second 
and a half.  It would take the drone four and a half seconds to get 
within range of the ship. 

Shit. It waited until the mirrorshield was a couple of tenths of a 
second from failing, then signalled: ~ I surrender!, and hoped that it 
was talking to another machine; if it was relying on Affronter 
reactions it'd be fried before the message got through to their stupid 
animal brains. 

The laser flicked off.  The drone kept its EM shields up. 

It was heading towards the Affronter vessel at about half a klick a 
second; the ship's be-bladed, swollen-looking bulk drifted closer. 

~ Turn off your shields! 

~ I can't!  It put expression into the signal, so that it came across as 
a wail. 

~ Now! 

~ I'm trying!  I'm trying!  You damaged me!  Damaged me even 
more!  Such weaponry!  What chance have I, a mere drone, 
something smaller than an Affronter's beak, against such power? 

Nearly in range.  Not far.  Not far now.  Another two seconds. 

~ Drop your shields instantly and allow yourself to be taken over or 
suffer instant destruction. 

Still nearly two seconds.  It would never keep them talking long 
enough… 

~ Please don't!  I'm attempting to shut off the shield projector, but 
it's in fail-safe mode; it won't let itself be shut off.  It's arguing; can 
you believe that?  But, honestly; I am doing my best.  Please believe 
me. Please don't kill me.  I'm the only survivor, you know; our ship 
was attacked!  I was lucky to get away.  I've never seen anything like 
it.  Never heard of anything like it either. 

A pause.  A pause of animal dimensions.  Time for animal 
thoughts.  Loads of time. 

~ Final chance; turn off- 

~ There; turning shields off now.  I'm all yours. 

The drone Sisela Ytheleus 1/2 turned off its electromagnetic 
mirrorshield.  In the same instant, it fired its laser straight at the 
Affronter ship. 

An instant later it released the containment around its remaining 
stock of anti-matter, detonated its in-built self-destruct charge and 
instructed the single nanomissile it still carried within its body to 
explode too. 

~ Fuck you! were its final words. 

Its last emotion was a mixture of sorrow, elation, and a kind of 
desperate pride that its plan might have worked… Then it died, 
instantly and forever, in its own small fireball of heat and light. 

The cloud of glowing wreckage the drone's self-destruction had 
caused passed over the Affronter ship, and was duly swept by 
analysing 
sensors.  Plasma.  Atoms.  Nothing 
as 
big 
as 
a 

molecule.  Likewise the slowly expanding debris from the two groups 
of nanomissiles. 

Disappointment, then; that had been a particularly sophisticated 
model of Elencher drone, not far behind the leading-edge of Culture 
drone technology.  Capturing one would have been a good 
prize.  Still, it had put up a reasonable fight considering, and provided 
a morsel of unexpected sport. 

The Affront light cruiser Furious Purpose came about and headed 
slowly away from the scene of its miniature battle, carefully scanning 
for more nanomissiles.  They posed no threat to the cruiser, of 
course, but the small drone appeared to have tried to use some of 
the tiny weapons to place information in, and it might have left others 
behind which were not inclined to self-destruct when effector-
targeted.  None showed up.  The cruiser back-tracked along the 
course the drifting drone appeared to have taken.  It discovered a 
small cooling cloud of matter at one point, the remnants of some sort 
of 
explosion 
apparently, 
but 
that 
was 
all.  Beyond 
that; 

nothing.  Nothing everywhere one looked.  Most dissatisfying. 

The Furious Purpose's restless officers debated how much more time 
they should spend looking for this lost Elencher ship.  Had something 
happened to it?  Had the small drone been lying?  Might there be a 
more interesting opponent floating around out here somewhere? 

Or might it all be a ruse, a decoy?  The Culture - the real Culture, the 
wily ones, not these semi-mystical Elenchers with their miserable 
hankering to be somebody else - had been known to give whole 
Affronter fleets the run-around for several months with not dissimilar 
enticements and subterfuges, keeping them occupied, seemingly on 
the track of some wildly promising prey which turned out to be 
nothing at all, or a Culture ship with some ridiculous but earnestly 
argued excuse, while the Culture or one of its snivelling client species 
got on - or away - with something else somewhere else, spoiling 
rightful Affronter fun. 

How were they to know this was not one of those occasions?  Perhaps 
the Elencher ship was under contract to the Culture proper.  Perhaps 
they had lost the Explorer craft and a GCU - trailing them as they had 
been trailing the Elench craft - had slipped in to take its place.  Might 
this not be true? 

No, argued some of the officers, because the Culture would never 
sacrifice a drone it considered sentient. 

The rest thought about this, considered the Culture's bizarrely 
sentimental attitude to life, and were forced to concede the point. 

The cruiser spent another two days around the Esperi system and 
then broke away.  It returned to the habitat called Tier with a trivial 
but niggling engine fault. 

III 

Technically, it was a branch of metamathematics, usually called 
metamathics.  Metamathics; the investigation of the properties of 
Realities (more correctly, Reality-fields) intrinsically unknowable by 
and from our own, but whose general principles could be hazarded 
at. 

Metamathics led to everything else, it led to the places that nobody 
else had ever seen or heard of or previously imagined. 

It was like living half your life in a tiny, stuffy, warm grey box, and 
being moderately happy in there because you knew no better… and 
then discovering a little hole in one corner of the box, a tiny opening 
which you could get a finger into, and tease and pull at, so that 
eventually you created a tear, which led to a greater tear, which led 
to the box falling apart around you… so that you stepped out of the 
tiny box's confines into startlingly cool, clear fresh air and found 
yourself on top of a mountain, surrounded by deep valleys, sighing 
forests, soaring peaks, glittering lakes, sparkling snowfields and a 
stunning, breathtakingly blue sky.  And that, of course, wasn't even 
the start of the real story, that was more like the breath that is drawn 
in before the first syllable of the first word of the first paragraph of 
the first chapter of the first book of the first volume of the story. 

Metamathics led to the Mind equivalent of that experience, repeated 
a million times, magnified a billion times, and then beyond, to 
configurations of wonder and bliss even the simplest abstract of which 
the human-basic brain had no conceivable way of comprehending.  It 
was like a drug; an ultimately liberating, utterly enhancing, 
unadulterably beneficial, overpoweringly glorious drug for the 
intellect of machines as far beyond the sagacity of the human mind 
as they were beyond its understanding. 

This was the way the Minds spent their time.  They imagined entirely 
new universes with altered physical laws, and played with them, lived 

in them and tinkered with them, sometimes setting up the conditions 
for life, sometimes just letting things run to see if it would arise 
spontaneously, sometimes arranging things so that life was 
impossible but other kinds and types of bizarrely fabulous 
complication were enabled. 

Some of the universes possessed just one tiny but significant 
alteration, leading to some subtle twist in the way things worked, 
while others were so wildly, aberrantly different it could take a 
perfectly first-rate Mind the human equivalent of years of intense 
thought even to find the one tenuously familiar strand of recognisable 
reality 
that 
would 
allow 
it 
to 
translate 
the 
rest 
into 

comprehensibility.  Between those extremes lay an infinitude of 
universes of unutterable fascination, consummate joy and absolute 
enlightenment.  All that humanity knew and could understand, every 
single aspect, known, guessed at and hoped for in and of the universe 
was like a mean and base mud hut compared to the vast, glittering 
cloud-high palace of monumentally exquisite proportions and 
prodigious riches that was the metamathical realm.  Within the 
infinities raised to the power of infinities that those metamathical 
rules provided, the Minds built their immense pleasure-domes of 
rhapsodic philosophical ecstasy. 

That was where they lived.  That was their home.  When they weren't 
running ships, meddling with alien civilisations or planning the future 
course of the Culture itself, the Minds existed in those fantastic virtual 
realities, 
sojourning 
beyondward 
into 
the 
multi-dimensioned 

geographies of their unleashed imaginations, vanishingly far away 
from the single limited point that was reality. 

The Minds had long ago come up with a proper name for it; they 
called it the Irreal, but they thought of it as Infinite Fun.  That was 
what they really knew it as.  The Land of Infinite Fun. 

It did the experience pathetically little justice. 

…  The Sleeper Service promenaded metaphysically amongst the 
lush creates of its splendid disposition, an expanding shell of 
awareness in a dreamscape of staggering extent and complexity, like 

a gravity-free sun built by a jeweller of infinite patience and skill. It 
is absolutely the case, it said to itself, it is absolutely the case… 

There was only one problem with the Land of Infinite Fun, and that 
was that if you ever did lose yourself in it completely - as Minds 
occasionally did, just as humans sometimes surrendered utterly to 
some AI environment - you could forget that there was a base reality 
at all.  In a way, this didn't really matter, as long as there was 
somebody back where you came from minding the hearth.  The 
problem came when there was nobody left or inclined to tend the fire, 
mind the store, look after the housekeeping (or however you wanted 
to express it), or if somebody or something else - somebody or 
something from outside, the sort of entity that came under the 
general heading of an Outside Context Problem, for example - 
decided they wanted to meddle with the fire in that hearth, the stock 
in the store, the contents and running of the house; if you'd spent all 
your time having Fun, with no way back to reality, or just no idea 
what to do to protect yourself when you did get back there, then you 
were vulnerable.  In fact, you were probably dead, or enslaved. 

It didn't matter that base reality was petty and grey and mean and 
demeaning and quite empty of meaning compared to the glorious 
majesty of 
the 
multi-hued 
life 
you'd 
been 
living 
through 

metamathics; it didn't matter that base reality was of no 
conseεquence 
aesthetically, 
hedonistically, 
metamathically, 

intellectually and philosophically; if that was the single foundation-
stone that all your higher-level comfort and joy rested upon, and it 
was kicked away from underneath you, you fell, and your limitless 
pleasure realms fell with you. 

It was just like some ancient electricity-powered computer; it didn't 
matter how fast, error-free and tireless it was, it didn't matter how 
great a labour-saving boon it was, it didn't matter what it could do or 
how many different ways it could amaze; if you pulled its plug out, or 
just hit the Off button, all it became was a lump of matter; all its 
programs became just settings, dead instructions, and all its 
computations vanished as quickly as they'd moved. 

It was, also, like the dependency of the human-basic brain on the 
human-basic body; no matter how intelligent, perceptive and gifted 

you were, no matter how entirely you lived for the ascetic rewards of 
the intellect and eschewed the material world and the ignobility of the 
flesh, if your heart just gave out… 

That was the Dependency Principle; that you could never forget 
where your Off switches were located, even if it was somewhere 
tiresome.  It was the problem that Subliming dispensed with, of 
course, and it was one of the (usually more minor) reasons that 
civiεlisations chose Elderhood; if your course was set in that direction 
in the first place then eventually that reliance on the material 
universe came to seem vestigial, untidy, pointless, and even 
embarrassing. 

It wasn't the course the Culture had fully embarked upon, at least not 
yet, but as a society it was well aware of both the difficulties 
presented by remaining in base reality and the attractions of the 
Sublime.  In the meantime, it compromised, busying itself in the 
macrocosmic clumsiness and petty, messy profanity of the real 
galaxy while at the same time exploring the transcendental 
possibilities of the sacred Irreal. 

It is absolutely the- 

A single signal flicked the great ship's attention entirely back to base 
reality: 

oGSV 
Sleeper 
Service. 

Done. 

Then it located Amorphia - the avatar was wandering bemused 
through kilometres of tableaux exhibition space that had once been 
accommodation sections - and instructed it to re-visit the woman 
Dajeil Gelian. 

IV 

Genar-Hofoen was distinctly unimpressed with his quarters aboard 
the Battle-Cruiser Kiss The Blade. For one thing, they smelled. 

~ What is that? he asked, his nose wrinkling. ~ Methane? 

~ Methane is odourless, Genar-Hofoen, the suit said. ~ I believe the 
smell you find objectionable may be a mixture of methanal and 
methylamine. 

~ Fucking horrible smell, whatever it is. 

~ I'm sure your mucous membrane receptors will cease to react to it 
before long. 

~ I certainly hope so. 

He was standing in what was supposed to be his bedroom.  It was 
cold.  It was very big; a ten-metre square - plenty of headroom - but 
it was cold; he could see his breath.  He still wore most of the gelfield 
suit but he'd detached all but the nape-part of the neck and let the 
head of the suit flop down over his back so that he could get a fresher 
impression of his quarters, which consisted of a vestibule, a lounge, 
a 
frighteningly 
industrial-looking 
kitchen-diner, 
an 
equally 

intimidatingly mechanical bathroom and this so-called bedroom.  He 
was starting to wish he hadn't bothered.  The walls, floor and ceiling 
of the room were some sort of white plastic; the floor bulged up to 
create a sort of platform on which a huge white thing lay spread, like 
a cloud made solid. ~ What, he asked, pointing at the bed, ~ is that? 

~ I think it is your bed. 

~ I'd guessed.  But what is that… thing lying on it? 

~ Quilt?  Duvet?  Bed-covering. 

~ What do you want to cover it for? he asked, genuinely confused. 

~ Well, it's more to cover you, I think, when you're asleep, the suit 
said, sounding uncertain. 

The man dropped his hold-all onto the shiny plastic floor and went 
forward to heft the white cloudy thing.  It felt quite light.  Posεsibly 
a little damp, unless the suit's tactiles were getting confused.  He 
pulled a glove-section back and touched the bed-cover thing with his 
bare skin.  Cold.  Maybe damp. ~ Module?  Genar-Hofoen said.  He'd 
get its opinion on all this. 

~ You can't talk to Scopell-Afranqui directly, remember? the suit said 
politely. 

~ Shit, Genar-Hofoen said.  He rubbed the material of the bedεcover 
between his fingers. ~ This feel damp to you, suit? 

~ A little.  Do you want me to ask the ship to patch you through to 
the module? 

~ Eh?  Oh, no; don't bother.  We moving yet? 

~ No. 

The man shook his head. ~ Horrible smell, he said.  He prodded the 
bed-cover thing again.  He wished now he'd insisted that the module 
be accommodated on board the ship so that he could live inside it, 
but the Affronters had said this wasn't possible; hangar space was at 
a premium on all three ships.  The module had protested, and he'd 
made supportive noises, but he had been rather entertained by the 
idea that Scopell-Afranqui would have to stay here while he went 
zapping off to far-off parts of the galaxy on an important 
mission.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  Now he wasn't so 
sure. 

There was a distant growling noise and a tremor underεfoot; then 
there came a jerk that almost threw the human off his feet.  He 
staggered to one side and had to sit down on the bed. 

It made a squelching sound.  He stared at it, aghast. 

~ Now we're moving, said the suit. 

V 

Singing softly to himself, the man tended the little fire he had started 
on the floor of the hall, beneath and between the stored ships, 
arrayed in the blackness like the trunks of enormous trees in a silent, 
petrified forest.  Gestra Ishmethit was surveying his charges in the 
deep-buried darkness that was Pittance. 

Pittance was a huge irregular lump of matter, two hundred kilometres 
across at its narrowest point and ninety-eight per cent iron by 
volume.  It was the remnant of a catastrophe which had occurred 
over four billion years earlier, when the planet of whose core it had 
been part had been struck by another large body.  Expelled from its 
own solar system by that cataclysm, it had wandered between the 
stars for a quarter of the life of the universe, uncaptured by any other 
gravity well but subtly affected by all it passed anywhere near.  It 
had been discovered drifting in deep space a millennium ago by a 
GCU taking an eccentrically trajectorial course between two stellar 
systems, it had been given the brief examination its simple and 
homogeneous composition deserved and then had been left to glide, 
noted, effectively tagged, untouched, but given the name Pittance. 

When the time came, five hundred years later, to dismantle the 
colossal war machine the Culture had created in order to destroy that 
of the Idirans, Pittance had suddenly been found a role. 

Most of the Culture's warships had been decommissioned and 
dismantled.  A few were retained, demilitarised, to act as express 
delivery systems for small packages of matter - humans, for example 
- on the rare occasions when the transmission of information alone 
was not sufficient to deal with a problem, and an even smaller number 
were kept intact and operational; two hundred years after the war 
ended, the number of fully active warcraft was actually smaller than 
it had been before the conflict began (though, as the Culture's critics 
never tired of pointing out, the average - and avowedly completely 
peaceful - General Contact Unit was more than a match for the vast 

majority of alien craft it was likely to bump into over the course of its 
career). 

Never a civilisation to take too many risks, however, and priding itself 
on the assiduity of its bet-hedging, the Culture had not disposed of 
all the remaining craft; a few thousand - representing less than a per 
cent of the original total - were kept in reserve, fully armed save for 
their usual complement of Displacer-dispatched explosive warheads 
(a relatively minor weapon system anyway), which they and other 
craft would manufacture in the event of mobilisation.  Most of the 
mothballed ships were retained within a scattering of Culture Orbitals, 
chosen so that if there ever was an emergency which the craft would 
be required to deal with, no part of the greater galaxy would be more 
than a month or so's flight away. 

Still guarding against threats and possibilities even it found difficult 
to specify, some of the Culture's stored warvessels were harboured 
not in or around highly populated Orbitals full of life and the comings 
and goings of cruise ships and visiting GSVs, but in places as far out 
of the way as it was possible to find amongst the cavernously cold 
and empty spaces of the great lens; quiet, secret, hidden places; 
places off the beaten track, places possibly nobody else even knew 
existed. 

Pittance had been chosen as one of those places. 

The General Systems Vehicle Uninvited Guest and a fleet of 
accompanying warcraft had been dispatched to rendezvous with the 
cold, dark, wandering mass.  It was found exactly where it had been 
predicted it ought to be, and work began.  Firstly, a series of 
enormous halls had been hollowed out of its interior, then a precisely 
weighed and shaped piece of the matter mined from one of those 
giant hangars had been aimed with millimetric accuracy and fired at 
Pittance by the GSV, leaving a small new crater on the surface of the 
world, exactly as though it had been struck by another, smaller, piece 
of interstellar debris. 

This was done because Pittance wasn't spinning quite quickly enough 
or heading in exactly the right direction for the Culture's purposes; 
the exquisitely engineered collision made both alterεations at 

once.  So Pittance spun a little quicker to provide a more powerful 
hint of artificial gravity inside and its course was altered just a fraction 
to deflect it from a star system it would otherwise have drifted 
through in five and a half thousand years or so. 

A number of giant Displacer units were set within the fabric of Pittance 
and the warships were safely Displaced, one at a time, into the giant 
spaces the GSV had created.  Lastly, a frightening variety and 
number of sensory and weapon systems had been emplaced, 
camouflaged on the surface of Pittance and buried deep underneath 
it, while a cloud of tiny, dark, almost invisible but apocalyptically 
powerful devices were placed in orbit about the slowly tumbling mass, 
also to watch for unwelcome guests, and - if necessary - welcome 
them with destruction. 

Its work finished, the Uninvited Guest had departed, taking with it 
most of the iron mined from Pittance's interior.  It left behind a world 
that - save for that plausible-looking extra crater - seemed 
untouched; even its overall mass was almost exactly as it had been 
before, again, minus a little to allow for the collision it had suffered, 
the debris of which was allowed to drift as the laws of gravity dictated, 
most of it sailing like lazy shrapnel spinning into space but a little of 
it - captured by the tiny world's weak gravitational field - drifting 
along with it, and so incidentally providing perfect cover for the cloud 
of black-body sentry devices. 

Watching over Pittance from near its centre was its own quiet Mind, 
carefully designed to enjoy the quiet life and to take a subdued, 
passive pride in the feeling of containing, and jealously guarding, an 
almost incalculable amount of stored, latent, preferably never-to-be-
used power. 

The rarefied, specialist Minds in the warships themselves had been 
consulted like the rest on their fate those five hundred years ago; 
those in Storage at Pittance had been of the persuasion that preferred 
to sleep until they might be needed, and been prepared to accept that 
their sleep might be very long indeed, before quite probably ending 
in battle and death.  What they had all agreed they would prefer 
would be to be woken only as a prelude to joining the Culture's 
ultimate Sublimation, if and when that became the society's 

choice.  Until then they would be content to slumber in their dark 
halls, the war gods of past wrath implicitly guarding the peace of the 
present and the security of the future. 

Meanwhile the Mind of Pittance watched over them, and looked out 
into the resounding silence and the sun-freckled darkness of the 
spaces between the stars, forever content and ineffably satisfied with 
the absence of anything remotely interesting happening. 

Pittance was a very safe place, then, and Gestra Ishmethit liked safe 
places.  It was a very lonely place, and Gestra Ishmethit had always 
craved loneliness.  It was at once a very important place and a place 
that almost nobody knew or cared about or indeed probably ever 
would, and that also suited Gestra Ishmethit quite perfectly, because 
he was a strange creature, and accepted that he was. 

Tall, adolescently gawky and awkward despite his two hundred years, 
Gestra felt he had been an outsider all his life.  He'd tried physical 
alteration (he'd been quite handsome, for a while), he'd tried being 
female (she'd been quite pretty, she'd been told), he'd tried moving 
away from where he'd been brought up (he'd moved half the galaxy 
away to an Orbital quite different but every bit as pleasant as his 
home) and he'd tried a life lived adream (he'd been a merman prince 
in a water-filled space ship fighting an evil machine-hive mind, and 
according to the scenario was supposed to woo the warrior princess 
of another clan) but in all the things he'd tried he had never felt 
anything else than awkward: being handsome was worse than being 
gangly and bumbling because his body felt like a lie he was wearing; 
being a woman was the same, and somehow embarrassing, as well, 
as though it was somebody else's body he had kidnapped from inside; 
moving away just left him terrified of having to explain to people why 
he'd wanted to leave home in the first place, and living in a dream 
scenario all day and night just felt wrong; he had a horror of 
immersing himself in that virtual world as completely as his merman 
did in his watery realm and thus losing hold of what he felt was a 
tenuous grip on reality at the best of times, and so he'd lived the 
scenario with the nagging sensation that he was just a pet fish in 
somebody else's fish tank, swimming in circles through the prettified 

ruins of sunken castles.  In the end, to his mortification, the princess 
had defected to the machine hive-mind. 

The plain fact was that he didn't like talking to people, he didn't like 
mixing with them and he didn't even like thinking about them 
individually.  The best he could manage was when he was well away 
from people; then he could feel a not unpleasant craving for their 
company as a whole, a craving that quite vanished - to be replaced 
by stomach-churning dread - the instant it looked like being satisfied. 

Gestra Ishmethit was a freak; despite being born to the most ordinary 
and healthy of mothers (and an equally ordinary father), in the most 
ordinary of families on the most ordinary of Orbitals and having the 
most ordinary of upbringings, an accident of birth, or some all-but-
impossible conjunction of disposition and upbringing, had left him the 
sort of person the Culture's carefully meddled-with genes virtually 
never threw up; a genuine misfit, something even rarer in the Culture 
than a baby born physically deformed. 

But whereas it was perfectly simple to replace or regrow a stunted 
limb or a misshapen face, it was a different matter when the oddness 
lay inside, a fact Gestra had always accepted with an equanimity he 
sometimes suspected people regarded as even more freakish than his 
original almost pathological shyness.  Why didn't he just have the 
condition treated? his relations and few acquaintances asked.  Why 
didn't he ask to remain as much himself as possible, yet with this 
strange aberrancy removed, expunged?  It might not be easy, but it 
would be painless; probably it could be done in his sleep; he'd 
remember nothing about it and when he woke up he could live a 
normal life. 

He came to the attention of AIs, drones, humans and Minds that took 
an interest in that sort of thing; soon they were queuing up to treat 
him; he was a challenge!  He became so frightened by their - by turns 
- kind, cheery, cajoling, brusque or just plain plaintive entreaties to 
talk to him, counsel him, explain the merits of their various 
treatments and courses to him that he stopped answering his 
terminal and practically became a hermit in a summer house in his 
family's estate, unable to explain that despite it all - indeed, exactly 
because of all his previous attempts to integrate with the rest of 

society and what he had learned about himself through them - he 
wanted to be who he was, not the person he would become if he lost 
the one trait that distinguished him from everybody else, no matter 
how perverse that decision seemed to others. 

In the end it had taken the intervention of the Hub Mind of his home 
Orbital to come up with a solution.  A drone from Contact had come 
to speak to him one day. 

He'd always found it easier talking to drones rather than humans, and 
this drone had been somehow particularly busiεness-like but 
unconcernedly charming as well, and after probably the longest 
conversation with anybody Gestra had ever had, it had offered him a 
variety of posts where he could be alone.  He had chosen the position 
where he could be most alone and most lonely, where he could 
happily yearn for the human contact he knew was the one thing he 
was incapable of appreciating. 

It was, in the end, a sinecure; it had been explained from the 
beginning that he would not really have anything to do on Pittance; 
he would simply be there; a symbolic human presence amongst the 
mass of quiescent weapons, a witness to the Mind's silent sentinelship 
over the sleeping machines.  Gestra Ishmethit had been perfectly 
happy with that lack of responsibility, too, and had now been resident 
on Pittance for one and a half centuries, had not once left to go 
anywhere else, had not received a single visitor in all that time and 
had never felt anything less than content.  Some days, he even felt 
happy. 

The ships were arranged in lines and rows sixty-four at a time in the 
series of huge dark spaces.  Those great halls were kept cold and in 
vacuum, but Gestra had discovered that if he found some rubbish 
from his quarters and kept it warm in a gelfield sack, and then set it 
down on the chill floor of one of the hangars and blew oxygen over it 
from a pressurised tank, it could be made to burn.  Quite a 
satisfactory little fire could be got going, flaring white and yellow in 
the breath of gas and producing a quickly dispersing cloud of smoke 
and soot.  He had found that by adjusting the flow of oxygen and 
directing it through a nozzle he had designed and made himself, he 

could produce a fierce blaze, a dull red glow or any state of 
conflagration in between. 

He knew the Mind didn't like him doing this, but it amused him, and 
it was almost the only thing he did which annoyed it.  Besides, the 
Mind had grudgingly admitted both that the amount of heat produced 
was too small ever to leak through the eighty kilometres of iron to 
show up on the surface of Pittance and that ultimately the waste 
products of the combustion would be recovered and recycled, so 
Gestra felt free to indulge himself with a clear conscience, every few 
months or so. 

Today's fire was composed of some old wall hangings he'd grown tired 
of, some vegetable scraps from past meals, and tiny bits and pieces 
of wood.  The wooden scraps were produced by his hobby, which was 
constructing one-in-one-twenty-eighth scale models of ancient sailing 
ships. 

He had drained the swimming pool in his quarters and turned it into 
a miniature forestry plantation and farm using some of the biomass 
the Mind and he had been provided with; tiny trees grew there which 
he cut down and sliced into little planks and turned on lathes to 
produce all the masts, spars, decks and other wooden parts the sea 
ships required.  Other bonsai plants in the forest provided long fibres 
which he teased and twisted and coiled into thread- and string-thin 
ropes to make halyards and sheets.  Different plants let him create 
still thinner fibres which he wove into sails on infinitesimal looms he 
had also constructed himself.  The iron and steel parts were made 
from material scraped from the iron walls of Pittance itself.  He 
smelted the metal in a miniature furnace to rid it of the last traces of 
impurities and either flattened it in a tiny hand-turned rolling mill, 
cast it using wax and talc-like fines, or turned it on microscopic 
lathes.  Another furnace fused sand - taken from the beach which had 
been part of the swimming pool - to make wafer-thin sheets of glass 
for portholes and skylights.  Yet more of the life-support system's 
biomass was used to produce pitch and oils, which caulked the hull 
and greased the little winches, derricks and other pieces of 
machinery.  His most precious commodity was brass, which he had 
to pare from an antique telescope his mother had given him (with 

some ironic comment he had long chosen to forget) when he'd 
announced his decision to leave for Pittance. (His mother was herself 
Stored now; one of his great grand-nieces had sent him a letter.) 

It had taken him ten years to make the tiny machines to make the 
ships, and then making each ship occupied another twenty years of 
his time.  He had constructed six vessels so far, each slightly larger 
and better made than the one before.  He had almost completed a 
seventh, with just the sails to finish and sew; the scraps of wood he 
was burning were the last of its off-cuts and compacted sawdust. 

The little fire burned well enough.  He let it blaze and looked 
around.  His breath sounded loud in his suit as he lifted his head to 
gaze around the dark space.  The sixty-four ships stored in this hall 
were Gangster Class Rapid Offensive Units; slim segmented cylinders 
over two hundred metres tall and fifty in diameter.  The tiny glow 
from the fire was lost to normal sight amongst the spire-like heights 
of the ships; he had to press the control surfaces on the forearm of 
the ancient space suit to intensify the image displayed on the visor-
screen in front of him. 

The ships looked like they'd been tattooed.  Their hulls were covered 
in a bewildering swirl of patterns upon patterns upon patterns, a 
fractal welter of colours, designs and textures that saturated their 
every square millimetre.  He had seen this a hundred times before 
but it never failed to fascinate and amaze him. 

On a few occasions he had floated up to some of the ships and 
touched their skins, and even through the thickness of the gloves on 
the millennium-old suit he had felt the roughened surface, whorled 
and raised and encrusted beneath.  He had looked closely, then more 
closely still, using the suit's lights and the magnification on the visor-
screen to peer into the gaudy display in front of him, and found 
himself becoming lost within concentric layers of complexity and 
design.  Finally the suit was using electrons to scan the surface and 
imposing false colours on the surfaces displayed and still the 
complexity went on, down and down to the atomic level.  He had 
pulled back out through the layers and levels of motifs, figures, 
mandalas and fronds, his head buzzing with the extravagant, 
numbing complexity of it all. 

Gestra Ishmethit remembered seeing screen-shots of warships; they 
had been whatever colour they wanted to be - usually perfectly black 
or perfectly reflecting when they were not hidden by a hologram of 
the view straight through them - but he could not recall ever having 
seen such odd designs upon them.  He had consulted the Mind's 
archives.  Sure enough, the ships had been ordinary, plain-hulled 
craft when they had flown here.  He asked the Mind why the ships 
had become decorated so, writing to it on the display of his terminal 
as he always did when he wanted to communicate: Why ships 
tattooed look? 

The Mind had replied: Think of it as a form of armour, Gestra. 

And that was all he could get out of it. 

He decided he would have to be content to remain puzzled. 

The little fire sent quivering veins of dim light into the hollow shadows 
around the enigmatic towers of the dazzlingly patterned ships.  The 
only sound was his breathing.  He felt wonderfully alone here; even 
the Mind couldn't communicate with him here as long as he kept the 
suit's communicator turned off.  Here was perfect; here was total and 
complete loneliness, here was peace, and quiet, and a fire in the 
vacuum.  He lowered his gaze again, towards the embers. 

Something glinted near the floor of the hall, a couple of kilometres 
away. 

His heart seemed to freeze.  The thing glinted again.  Whatever it 
was, it was coming closer. 

He turned the suit communicator on with a shaking hand. 

Before his quivering fingers could tap in a question to the Mind, the 
display on his visor-screen, lit up: Gestra, we are to be 
visited.  Please return to your quarters. 

He stared at the text, his eyes wide, his heart thudding in his chest, 
his mind reeling.  The glowing letters stayed where they were, they 
added up to the same thing; they would not go away.  He inspected 

each one in turn, looking for mistakes, desperately trying to make 
some different kind of sense from them, but they kept repeating the 
same sentence, they kept meaning the same thing. 

Visited, he thought. Visited?  Visited?  Visited? 

He felt terror for the first time in one and a half centuries. 

The drone which had glinted in the shadows, which the Mind had sent 
to summon him because his suit communicator had been turned off, 
had to carry the man back to his quarters, he was shaking so 
much.  It had picked up the oxygen cylinder too, turning it off. 

Behind it, the fire went on glowing faintly for a few seconds in the 
darkness, then even that baleful glimmer succumbed to the empty 
coldness, and it winked out. 

5. Kiss The Blade 

I 

The Explorer Ship Break Even of the Stargazer Clan's Fifth fleet, part 
of the Zetetic Elench, looped slowly around the outer limit of the 
comet cloud of the star system Tremesia I/II, scanning beams briefly 
touching on as many of the dark, frozen bodies as it could, searching 
for its lost sister vessel. 

The double-sun system was relatively poor in comets; there were only 
a hundred billion of them.  However, many of them had orbits well 
outside the ecliptic and that helped to make the search every bit as 
difficult as it would have been with a greater number of comet nuclei 
but in a more planar cloud.  Even so, it was impossible to check all of 
them; ten thousand ships would have been required to thoroughly 
check every single sensor trace in the comet cloud to make sure that 
one of them was not a stricken ship, and the best the Break 
Even could do was briefly fasten its gaze on the most likely looking 
candidates. 

Just doing that bare minimum would take a full day for this system 
alone, and it had another nine stars allocated to it as prime 
possibilities, plus another eighty less likely solar systems.  The other 
six vessels of the Fifth fleet had similar schedules, similar allocations 
of stellar systems to attempt to search. 

Elencher ships sent routine location and status reports back to a 
responsible and reliable habitat, facility or course-scheduled craft 
every sixteen standard days.  The Peace Makes Plenty had signalled 
safely back to the Elench embassy on Tier along with the other seven 
ships of the fleet sixty-four days after they'd all left the habitat. 

Day eighty had come, and only seven had reported in.  The others 
immediately stopped heading any further away if that was the course 
they'd been set on; four days later, still with no word, and with no 
sign of anybody else having heard anything, the seven remaining 
ships of the Fifth fleet set their courses to converge on the last known 
position of the missing ship and accelerated to their maximum 
speed.  The first of them had arrived in the general volume where 
the Peace Makes Plenty ought to be five days later; the last one 
appeared another twelve days after that. 

They had to assume that the ship they were looking for had not 
travelled at that sort of speed since it had last signalled, they had to 
assume that it had been cruising, even loitering amongst the systems 
it had been investigating, they had to assume that it was somewhere 
within a stellar system, small nebula or gas cloud in the first place, 
and they had to assume that it was not deliberately trying to hide 
from them, or that somebody else was not deliberately trying to hide 
it from them. 

The stars themselves were relatively easy to check; microscopic as it 
might be compared to the average sun, a half-million tonne ship 
containing a few tonnes of anti-matter and a variety of highly exotic 
materials falling into a star left a tiny but distinct and unmistakable 
flash behind it, and usually a mark on the stellar surface that lasted 
for days at least; one loop round the star could tell you if that kind of 
disaster had befallen a missing craft.  Small solid planets were easy 
too, unless a ship was deliberately hiding or being hidden, which of 
course was perfectly possible in such situations and considerably 

more likely than a ship suffering some natural disaster or terminal 
technical 
fault.  Large 
gaseous 
planets 
presented 
a 
bigger 

challenge.  Asteroid belts, where they existed, could pose real 
problems, and comet clouds were a nightmare. 

In the vast majority of solar systems the spaces between the inner 
system and the comet cloud were easy to search for big, obvious 
things and pointless to search for small things or anything trying to 
hide.  Interstellar space was the same, but much worse; unless 
something was trying to signal you from out there, you could more 
or less forget about finding anything smaller than a planet. 

The Break Even and its crew, like the rest of the fleet, the Clan and 
the Elench, had no illusions about the likelihood of success their 
search offered.  They were doing it because you had to do something, 
because there was always just a chance, no matter how remote, that 
their sister ship was somewhere findable and obvious- orbiting a 
planet, sitting in a 1/6 Stabile round a big planet's orbit - and you 
wouldn't be able to live with yourself if you took the cold statistical 
view that there was next to zero hope of finding the ship intact, and 
then later discovered it had been there all along, savable at the time 
but later lost because nobody could be bothered to hope - and act - 
against the odds.  Still, the statistics did not make optimistic reading, 
indicating that the whole task was as close to being impossible as 
made little difference, and there was a morbid, depressing quality 
about such searches, almost as though they were more a kind of vigil 
for the dead, part of a funeral ceremony, than a practical attempt to 
look for the missing. 

The days went by; the ships, aware that whatever had befallen 
the Peace Makes Plenty might as easily happen to them, signalled 
their locations to each other every few hours. 

Sixteen days after the first ship had started searching and hundreds 
of investigated star systems later, the quest began to be wound 
down.  Over the next few days, five of the ships returned to the other 
parts of the Upper Leaf Spiral they had been exploring while two 
remained behind in the volume the Peace Makes Plenty ought still to 
be in, somewhere, carrying out more thorough explorations of the 
star systems as part of their normal mission profile, but always 

hoping that their missing sister ship might turn up, or at the very 
least that they might uncover some fragment of evidence, some hint 
of what had happened to their missing sibling. 

The fact that the ship had disappeared would not be reported outside 
the fleet for another sixteen days; the Stargazer clan would pass the 
sad news on to the rest of the Elench eight days subsequently, and 
the outside galaxy would be informed, if it cared, another month after 
that.  The Elench looked after their own, and kept themselves to 
themselves, as well. 

The Break Even powered away from the last stellar system it had 
investigated, leaving the red giant astern with a kind of dismal 
relief.  It was not one of the two craft who'd stay to continue the 
scaled-down search; it was heading back to the volume where it had 
been before the Peace Makes Plenty had gone missing.  It kept all its 
sensors sweeping on full scan as it moved away from the giant sun, 
through the orbits of two small, cold planets and, further out, the 
dark, gelid bodies of the comet nuclei.  Its course took it directly 
towards the next nearest star; on the way it swept interstellar space 
with its sensors too, still hoping, still half dreading… but nothing 
turned up.  Esperi's single, dim-red globe fell away astern, like an 
ember cooling to ash in the freezing night. 

A few hours later the ship was out of the volume altogether, heading 
out-down-spinward back to its allotted crop of distant, anonymous 
stars.

almost straight to the Excession.  Then there is a report from the

of

You 
are 
being 
paranoid. 

A lot of course schedules have been altered recently thanks to this 
thing. 
I'm thinking about finding an excuse to edge in that direction myself. 
And as you point out yourself, the Meatfucker is heading towards 
the Lower Swirl, not the Upper. 

oo 

There is a certain potential rendezvous implied in that direction; do I 
have to spell it out?  And the point remains; these are the only three 
schedules which change at the same point. 

oo 

They alter over the course of five hours; hardly a 'point'.  And even 
so; what if they do?  And what's so special about nineteen or even 
nineteen/two days ago? 

oo 

[stuttered 
tight 
point, 
M32] 

It does not worry you that there might be a conspiracy in the highest 
levels of a Contact/SC committee?  I am suggesting that there may 
be prior knowledge here; that some tip or clue was received by one 
of our colleagues which was not passed on to anybody else.  That is 
what is so special about nineteen days ago; it is less than fifty-seven 
days ago, when whatever took place in the vicinity of the excession 
appears to have occurred. 

oo 

Yes yes yes.  But:  SO WHAT?  My dear ship, which of us has not 
taken part in some scheme, some ruse or secret plan, some 
stratagem or diversion, sometimes of quite a sizable and labyrinthine 
nature and involving matters of considerable import?  They're what 
makes ordinary life worth living!  So some of our chums in the Core 
Group may have had a sniff of something interesting in that 
region.  Good for them, I say!  Have you never had some clue, some 
lead, a hint of some potential sport, amusement, jape or focus of 
contemplation that was certainly worth acting upon but equally 
decidedly did not merit advertising due to some reservation 
concerning potential embarrassment, the wish not to seem vain or 
simply a desire for privacy? 

Really, I think there is no conspiracy here whatsoever, and that even 
if there is, it is a benign one.  Apart from anything else, there is one 
question you have not, I believe, addressed:  What is the conspiracy 
for?  If it was merely a couple of Minds getting wind of something odd 
in the Upper Leaf Spiral and finessing a search there, are they not 
simply to be congratulated? 

oo 

But there has been nothing this important before!  This is perhaps 
our first real OCP and we may not be up to the challenge it 
represents. Meat it makes me ashamed!  I just find this all so 
distressing!  For millennia we have congratulated ourselves on our 
wisdom and maturity and revelled in our freedom from baser drives 
and from the ignobility of thought and action that desperation born 
of indigence produces.  My fear - my terror! - is that our freedom 

from material concern has blinded us to our true, underlying nature; 
we have been good because we have never needed to make the 
choice between that and anything else. 

Altruism has been imposed upon us! 

Now suddenly we are presented with something we cannot 
manufacture or simulate, something which is to us as precious metals 
or stones or just other lands were to ancient monarchs, and we may 
find that we are prepared to cheat and lie and scheme and plot like 
any bloody tyrant and contemplate adopting any behaviour however 
reprehensible so that we may grab this prize.  It is as if we have been 
children until this point, playing without care and dressing in but not 
filling adult clothes, blithely assuming that when we are grown we 
shall behave as we have done in the headlong, heedless innocence 
that has been our life so far. 

oo 

But, my dear friend, none of this has happened yet! 

oo 

Have you not carried out the projections?  I took your advice to spend 
more time in metamathical pursuits, modelling the likely course of 
events, divining the shape of the future.  The results worry me.  What 
I feel myself worries me.  I wonder what we may stop at, what we 
may not stop at to attain the prize this Excession may offer. 

oo 

I meant spend more time enjoying yourself, as you well 
know.  Besides: simulations, abstractions, projections; these are only 
themselves, not the reality of what they claim to represent.  Attend 
to the actuality of events.  We have a fascinating phenomenon before 
us and we are taking all reasonable precautions as we deal, or 
prepare to deal, with it.  Some of our colleagues show laudable 
enterprise and initiative while others - ourselves - exhibit caution just 
as commendable as - and in sum complementary to - their 

ambition.  What is there to fear but the wild imaginings which may 
well be the result of looking too far beyond the scale of relevance? 

I suppose so.  Perhaps it is me.  Certainly I see worrying signs 
everywhere.  I dare say it must be me.  I may still make some further 
inquiries, but I take your point. 

Make your inquiries if you must, but frankly I think it is this constant 
urge to inquire that causes you such pain; when one is able to 
scrutinise a subject as closely as we are - and to do so with the cross-
referential capacity we possess, then the closer one looks 
into anything the more coincidences one finds, perfectly innocent 
though they may be. 

What is the point of inquiring at such depth that one loses sight of 
the sunlit surface? 

Lay up that magnifying glass and take up thy drink glass, my friend. 

Slip off the academic gown and on with the antic pants! 

oo 

I thank you for your advice.  I am reassured somewhat.  I shall 
consider what you say.  Do keep in touch.  Farewell for now.

And I still think you should let it in with us.  It almost certainly now 
suspects you are part of the conspiracy. 

I have an image to maintain!  And I would point out that we are still 
very much in the dark; we are not yet sure there is a conspiracy 
beyond the kind of normal outsmarting, outcliqueing nonsense in 
which all of us indulge from time to time.  What purpose would 
formally extending the circumference of our concern serve, for 
now?  Our sleuth is still behaving as though it is one of us but it knows 
nothing of our scepticism; we have naught to gain by bringing it 
aboard at present.  If it is genuine it will apply itself to our purpose 
and if discovered the shadow of its guilt will not fall across us; if it is 
a test then it - they - may decide to bait us with more information of 
genuine interest, delivered at no cost to our virtue.  Are we 
agreed?  Have I convinced you?  Anyway, enough of that; have we 
yet a plan?  What was the result of your own investigations? 

oo 

Frustratingly vague.  An exhaustive search has thrown up one remote 
possibility… but it remains an improbability predicated upon an 
uncertainty.

by our communicating with our mutual friend?

Why, that we are allowed to share in its inimitable objectivity.  What 
else? 

oo 

That is the general volume of my concern.  I'll say no more. 

oo 

What?  Don't be ridiculous.  Elaborate. 

No.  You know what you said to our unwitting fellow in suspicion 
about not advertising lines of inquiry which might end in 
embarεrassment… 

Unfair!  After all I've shared with you! 

oo 

Yes, including the exciting opportunity to get involved with this in the 
first place.  Thanks a lot. 

oo 

Cast that up to me again would you?  I've said I'm sorry. Wish I'd 
never said anything now. 

oo 

Yes, but if the Anticipation Of A New Lover's Arrival finds out who 
passed on the information which led to the Fate Amenable To 
Change's search in the first place… 

oo 

I know, I know.  Look; I'm doing all I can.  I have requested a 
sympathetic ship to divert itself to Pittance, just in case.  That's 
where my prognostications indicate a site for possible future 
mischief. 

oo 

Death!  If it comes to that… 

III 

The twittering batball bounced off the centre of the high-scoring wall 
and flew straight towards Genar-Hofoen.  The creature's tiny, clipped 
wings paddled frantically at the atmosphere as it tried to right itself 
and flee.  One of its stumpy wings was ragged, perhaps even 
broken.  It started to curve away as it approached the human.  He 
took a good back-swing with his bat and slammed it into the little 
creature, sending it yelping and spinning away.  He'd intended it to 
head for the high-scoring wall, but the stroke had been slightly off-
target, resulting in the spin he'd given the thing and its course 
towards the corner between the high-scoring wall and the right-side 
forfeit baffle.  Shit, he thought; the batball thrashed at the 
atmosphere and curved further towards the forfeit baffle. 

Fivetide darted forward and with a flip of the bat strapped to one of 
his front limbs - and a resounding, 'Ha!' - snapped the batball into 
the centre of the high-scoring wall again; it thudded against the 
roundel and ricocheted off at an angle Genar-Hofoen knew he wasn't 
going to be able to intercept.  He lunged at it anyway, but the 
creature sailed slackly past, half a metre away from his outstretched 
bat.  He fell to the floor and rolled, feeling the gelfield suit tensing 
and squeezing him as it absorbed the shock.  He picked himself up to 
a sitting position and looked around.  He was breathing hard and his 
heart was hammering; playing this sort of game against another 
human would have been no joke in Affronter gravity.  Playing it 
against an Affronter, even one with half his tentacles sportingly tied 
round its back, was even harder work. 

'Hopeless!' Fivetide roared, crossing towards where the batball lay 
motionless near the back of the court.  As he passed the human he 
flicked a tentacle under Genar-Hofoen's chin and levered him up.  The 
gesture was almost certainly meant to be helpful, but it would have 
broken the average unprotected human neck.  Genar-Hofoen merely 
found himself propelled off the floor like a rock out of a catapult and 
sent sailing towards the ceiling of the court, arms flailing. 

~ Idiot! the suit said, as Genar-Hofoen reached the top of his 
trajectory.  He assumed the suit was talking about Fivetide. 

A tentacle wrapped itself round his waist like a whip. 'Oops!' Fivetide 
said, and lowered him safely to the floor with surprising gentleness. 
'Sorry about that, Genar-Hofoen,' he yelled. 'You know what they 
say; "It's a wise lad knows his own strength when he's having fun," 
eh!' He patted the human relatively gently on the head, then 
continued over to the motionless body of the batball.  He prodded it 
with the bat. 

'Don't breed them like they used to,' he said, then made a noise 
Genar-Hofoen had learned to interpret as a sigh. 

~ Tentacled scumbag fuckwit, said the suit. 

~ Suit, really! he thought, amused. 

~ Well… 

The suit was not in the best of moods.  He and it were spending a lot 
more time together; the suit didn't trust the containment around 
Genar-Hofoen's quarters in the ship and had insisted that the human 
keep it on, even when he was asleep.  Genar-Hofoen had grumbled, 
but not over-much; there were too many funny smells in his quarters 
for him to have complete faith in the Affront's attempt at a human 
life-support system.  The most the gelfield suit would let him do at 
night was peel aside its head section so that he could sleep with his 
face exposed; that way, even if his environment collapsed suddenly 
and totally, the suit would be able to protect him. 

Fivetide flicked the batball up with the end of his bat and flicked it 
over the transparent wall of the court, into the spectators' 
seats.  Then he banged on the wall, waking the snoozing form of the 
gelding on the far side. 

'Wake up, you dozy pellet!' Fivetide bellowed. 'Another batball, dolt!' 

The neutered Affronter adolescent jumped to its tentacle tips, its eye 
stalks waving around wildly, then it reached into a small cage by its 
side with one limb while another tentacle opened the door in the court 
wall.  It picked one batball out of the dozen or so tied up in the cage 
and handed the squirming creature to the adult Affronter, who 

accepted it then jerked forward and hissed at the adolescent, making 
it flinch.  It closed the door quickly. 

'Ha!' Fivetide shouted, putting the trussed, wriggling batball to his 
forebeak and tearing the cord that had held it immobile. 'Another 
game, Genar-Hofoen?' Fivetide spat the short length of cord away 
and patted the batball up and down in one of his limbs while the little 
animal flexed its abbreviated wings. 

'Why not?' Genar-Hofoen said coolly.  He was exhausted, but he 
wasn't going to let Fivetide know. 

'Nine-nil to me, I believe,' the Affronter said, holding the batball up 
to his eyes. 'I know,' he said. 'Let's make it more interesting.' He put 
the struggling batball into the tip of his forebeak, his eye stalks bent 
forward and down to look at what he was doing.  There was a delicate 
movement around Fivetide's beak-fronds and a tiny screech, 
accompanied by a faint pop. 

Fivetide withdrew the creature from his beak and inspected it, 
apparently satisfied. 'There,' he said. 'Always good for a change, 
playing with a blinded one.' He threw the writhing, mewling creature 
to Genar-Hofoen. 'Your serve, I believe.' 

The problem stemmed from an accident of galactic topography and a 
combination of bad luck and bad timing. 

The fuzzily specified region which had given rise to the various species 
that had eventually made up the Culture had been on the far side of 
the galaxy from the Affront home planet, and contacts between the 
Culture and the Affront had been unusually sparse for a long time for 
a variety of frankly banal reasons.  By the time the Culture came to 
know the Affront better - shortly after the long distraction of the 
Idiran war - the Affront were a rapidly developing and swiftly 
maturing species, and short of another war there was no practical 
way of quickly changing either their nature or behaviour. 

Some Culture Minds had argued at the time that a quick war against 
the Affront was exactly the right course of action, but even as they'd 
started setting out their case they'd known it was already lost; for all 
that the Culture was just then at a peak of military power it had never 
expected to attain at the start of that long and terrible conflict, just 
so there was a corresponding determination at all levels that - the 
task of stopping the Idirans' relentless expansion having been 
accomplished - the Culture would neither need nor seek to achieve 
such a martial zenith again.  Even while the Minds concerned had 
been contending that a single abrupt and crushing blow would benefit 
all concerned - including the Affront, not just ultimately, but soon - 
the Culture's warships were being stood down, deactivated, 
componented, stored and demilitarised by the tens of thousands, 
while its trillions of citizens were congratulating themselves on a job 
well done and returning with the relish of the truly peace-loving to 
the uninhibited enjoyment of all the recreational wonders the 
resolutely hedonism-focused society of the Culture had to offer. 

There had probably never been a less propitious time for arguing that 
more fighting was a good idea, and the argument duly foundered, 
though the problem remained. 

Part of the problem was that the Affront had the disturbing habit of 
treating every other species they encountered with either total 
suspicion or amused contempt, depending almost entirely on whether 
that civilisation was ahead of or behind them in technoεlogical 
development.  There had been one developed species - the 
Padressahl - in that same volume of the galaxy which had been 
sufficiently like the Affront in terms of evolutionary background and 

physical appearance to be treated almost as friends by the Affront 
and which yet had a moral outlook similar enough to the Culture's to 
consider it worth the effort of chaperoning the Affront with the other 
local species, and, to their eternal credit, the Padressahl had been 
doggedly endeavouring to nudge the Affront into something remotely 
resembling decent behaviour for more centuries than they cared to 
remember or admit. 

It was the Padressahl who had given the Affront their name; originally 
the Affront had called themselves after their home world, 
Issorile.  Calling them the Affront - following an episode involving a 
Padressahl trade mission to Issorile which the recipients had treated 
more as a food parcel - had been most decidedly intended as an 
insult, but the Issorilians, as they then were, thought that 'Affront' 
sounded much better and had steadfastly refused to drop their new 
name even after they had formed their loose patron/protégé alliance 
with the Padressahl. 

However, a century or so after the end of the Idiran War, the 
Padressahl had had what the Culture regarded as the gross bad 
manners to suddenly sublime off into Advanced Elderhood at just the 
wrong time, leaving their less mature charges joyfully off the leash 
and both snapping at the heels of the local members of the Culture's 
great long straggling civilisational caravan wending its way towards 
progress (whether they went wittingly or not), and positively 
savaging several of the even less well-developed neighbouring 
species which for their own good nobody else had yet thought fit to 
contact. 

Suggestions by a few of the more cynical Culture Minds that the 
Padressahl decision to hit the hyperspace button and go for full don't-
give-a-damn-anymore god-head had been caused partially if not 
principally by their frustration and revulsion at the incorrigible 
ghastliness of Affront nature had never been either fully accepted or 
convincingly refuted. 

Whatever; in the end, with a deal of arm and tentacle twisting, some 
deftly managed suitable-technology donation (through what the 
Affront Intelligence Regiment still gleefully but naively thought was 
some really neat high-tech theft on their part), the occasional 

instance of knocking heads together (or whatever anatomical feature 
was considered appropriate) and a hefty amount of naked bribery 
(woefully inelegant to the refined intellect of the average Culture Mind 
- their tastes generally ran to far more rarefied forms of chicanery - 
but undeniably effective) the Affront had - kicking and screaming at 
times, admittedly - finally been more or less persuaded to join the 
great commonality of the galactic meta-civilisation; they had agreed 
to abide by its rules almost all the time and had grudgingly accepted 
that other beings beside themselves might have rights, or at least 
tolerably excusable desires (such as those concerning life, liberty, 
self-determination and so on), which occasionally might even 
override the self-evidently perfectly natural, demonstrably just and 
indeed arguably even sacred Affronter prerogative to go wherever 
they wanted and do whatever they damn well pleased, preferably 
while having a bit of fun with the locals at the same time. 

All that, however, represented only a partial solution to the least 
vexing part of the problem.  If the Affront had been simply one more 
expansionist species of callously immature but techεnologically 
localised adventurers with bad contact manners, the problem they 
represented to the Culture would have subsided to the sort of level 
that would have gone more or less unnoticed; they would have 
become just another part of the general clutter of inventively 
obdurate species struggling to express themselves in the vast 
emptiness that was the galaxy. 

The problem was rooted deeper, however; it went back further, it was 
more intrinsic.  The problem was that the Affront had spent 
uncounted millennia long before they'd even got off their own fog-
bound moon-planet tinkering with and carefully altering the flora and, 
especially, the fauna of that environment.  They had discovered at a 
relatively early point in their development how to change the genetic 
make-up of both their own inheritance - which almost by definition 
needed little further amendment, given their manifest superiority - 
and that of the creatures with whom they shared their home world. 

Those creatures had all, accordingly, been amended as the Affront 
saw fit, for their own amusement and delight.  The result was what 

one Culture Mind had described as a kind of self-perpetuating, never-
ending holocaust of pain and fear. 

Affronter society rested on a huge base of ruthlessly exploited 
juvenile geldings and a sub-class of oppressed females who unless 
born to the highest families - and not always even then - could count 
themselves lucky if they were only raped by the males from their own 
tribe.  It was generally regarded as significant - within the Culture if 
nowhere else - that one of the few aspects of their own genetic 
inheritance with which the Affront had deemed it desirable to meddle 
had been in the matter of making the act of sex a somewhat less 
pleasurable and considerably more painful act for their females than 
their basic genetic legacy required; the better, it was claimed, to 
further the considered good of the species rather than the 
impetuously selfish pleasure of the individual. 

When an Affronter went hunting for the artificially fattened 
treehurdlers, limbcroppers, paralice or skinstrippers that were their 
favoured prey, it was in a soar-chariot pushed by the animals called 
swiftwings which lived in a state of perpetual dread, their nervous 
systems and pheromone receptors painstakingly tuned to react with 
ever increasing levels of dread and the urge to escape as their 
masters became more and more excited and so exuded more of the 
relevant odours. 

The hunted animals themselves were artificially terrified as well, just 
by the very appearance of the Affronters, and so driven to ever more 
desperate manoeuvres in their frantic urge to escape. 

When an Affronters' skin was cleaned it was by the small animals 
called xysters, whose diligence had been vastly improved by giving 
them such a frenetic hunger for an Affronter's dead skin cells that 
unless they were overcome by exhaustion they were prone to bloating 
themselves literally to the point of bursting. 

Even the Affront's standard domesticated food animals had long since 
been declared as tasting much more interesting when they betrayed 
the signs of having been severely stressed, and so had also been 
altered to such a pitch of highly strung anxiety -and husbanded in 
conditions diligently contrived to intensify the effect - that they 

inevitably produced what any Affronter worth his methylacetylene 
would agree was the most inspiringly tasty meat this side of an event 
horizon. 

The examples went on; in fact, reviewing their society, it was more 
or less impossible to avoid manifestations of the Affronters' 
deliberate, even artistic use of genetic manipulation to produce 
through a kind of ebulliently misplaced selfishness - which to them 
was indistinguishable from genuine altruism - the sort of result it took 
most societies paroxysms of self-destructive wretchedness to 
generate. 

Hearty but horrible; that was the Affront. 'Progress through pain!' It 
was an Affronter saying.  Genar-Hofoen had even heard Fivetide say 
it.  He couldn't recall exactly, but it had probably been followed by a 
bellowed, 'Ho ho ho!' 

The Affront appalled the Culture; they appeared so unamendable, 
their attitude and their abominable morality seemed so secured 
against remedy.  The Culture had offered to provide machines to do 
the kind of jobs the juvenile castrati did, but the Affront just laughed; 
why, they could quite easily build machines of their own, but where 
was the honour in being served by a mere machine? 

Similarly, the Culture's attempts to persuade the Affront that there 
were other ways to control fertility and familial inheritance besides 
those which relied on the virtual imprisonment, genetic mutilation 
and organised violation of their females, or to consume vat-grown 
meat - better, if anything, than the real thing - or to offer non-
sentient versions of their hunting animals all met with equally derisive 
if brusquely good-humoured dismissals. 

Still, Genar-Hofoen liked them, and had come even to admire them 
for their vivacity and enthusiasm; he had never really subεscribed to 
the standard Culture belief that any form of suffering was intrinsically 
bad, he accepted that a degree of exploitation was inevitable in a 
developing culture, and leant towards the school of thought which 
held that evolution, or at least evolutionary pressures, ought to 
continue within and around a civilised species, rather than - as the 
Culture had done - choosing to replace evolution with a kind of 

democratically agreed physiological stasis-plus-option-list while 
handing over the real control of one's society to machines. 

It was not that Genar-Hofoen hated the Culture, or particularly 
wished it ill in its present form; he was deeply satisfied that he had 
been born into it and not some other humanoid species where you 
suffered, procreated and died and that was about it; he just didn't 
feel at home in the Culture all the time.  It was a motherland he 
wanted to leave and yet know he could always return to if, he 
wanted.  He wanted to experience life as an Affronter, and not just in 
some simulation, however accurate.  Plus, he wanted to go 
somewhere the Culture had never been, and well, explore. 

Neither ambition seemed to him all that much to ask, but he'd been 
thwarted in both desires until now.  He'd thought he'd detected 
movement 
on 
the 
Affronter 
side 
of 
things 
before 

this Sleeper business had come up, but now, if all concerned were to 
be believed, he could more or less have whatever he wanted, no 
strings attached. 

He found this suspicious in itself.  Special Circumstances was not 
notorious for its desire to issue blank cheques to anyone.  He 
wondered if he was being paranoid, or had just been living with the 
Affront for too long (none of his predecessors had lasted longer than 
a hundred days and he'd been here nearly two years already). 

Either way, he was being cautious; he had asked around.  He still had 
some replies to receive - they should be waiting for him when he 
arrived at Tier - but so far everything seemed to tally.  He had also 
asked to speak to a representation of the Desert Class MSV Not 
Invented Here, the ship acting as incident coordinator for all this - 
again, this ought to happen on Tier - and he'd looked up the craft's 
own history in the module's archives and transferred the results to 
the suit's own AI. 

The Desert Class had been the first type of General Systems Vehiεcle 
the Culture had constructed, providing the original template for the 
Very Large Fast Self-Sufficient Ship concept.  At three-and-a-bit 
klicks in length it was tiny by today's standards - ships twice its length 
and eight times its volume were routinely constructed inside GSVs 

the size of the Sleeper Service and the whole class had been demoted 
to Medium Systems Vehicle status - but it certainly had the distinction 
of age; the Not Invented Here had been around for nearly two 
millennia and boasted a long and interesting career, coming as close 
as the Culture's distributed and democratic military command 
structure had allowed to being in advisory control of several fleets in 
the course of the Idiran War.  It was now in that equivalent of 
serenely glorious senescence that affected some ancient Minds; no 
longer producing many smaller ships, taking relatively little to do with 
Contact's normal business, and keeping itself relatively sparsely 
populated. 

It remained, nevertheless, a full Culture ship; it hadn't taken a 
sabbatical, gone into a retreat or become an Eccentric, nor had it 
joined the Culture Ulterior - the fairly recently fashionable name for 
the bits of the Culture that had split away and weren't really fully 
paid-up members any more.  All the same, and despite the fact that 
the archive entry on the old ship was huge (as well as all the naked 
factual stuff, it contained one hundred and three different full-length 
biographies of the craft which it would have taken him a couple of 
years to read), Genar-Hofoen couldn't help feeling that there was a 
slight air of mystery about the old ship. 

It also occurred to him that Minds wrote voluminous biograεphies of 
each other in order to cover the odd potentially valuable or 
embarrassing nugget of truth under a mountain of bullshit. 

Also included in the archive entries were some fairly wild claims by a 
few of the smaller, more eccentric news and analyses journals and 
reviews - some of them one-person outfits - to the effect that the 
MSV was a member of some shadowy cabal, that it was part of a 
conspiracy of mostly very old craft which stepped in to take control 
of situations which might threaten the Culture's cozy proto-imperialist 
meta-hegemony; situations which proved beyond all doubt that the 
so-called normal democratic process of general policy-making was a 
complete and utter ultra-statist sham and the humans - and indeed 
their cousins and fellow dupes in this Mind-controlled plot, the drones 
- had even less power than they thought they had in the 
Culture…  There was quite a lot of stuff like that.  Genar-Hofoen read 

it until his head felt as if it was spinning, then he stopped; there came 
a point when if a conspiracy was that powerful and subtle it became 
pointless to worry about it. 

Whatever; doubtless the old MSV was not itself in total comεmand 
of the situation he was allowing himself to be dragged into, but just 
the tip of the iceberg, representing a collection, if not a cabal, of other 
interested and experienced Minds who'd all be having a say in the 
immediate reaction to the discovery of this artifact near Esperi. 

As well as his request for a talk with a personality-state of the Not 
Invented Here, Genar-Hofoen had sent messages to ships, drones 
and people he knew with SC connections, asking them if what he'd 
been told was all true.  A few of the nearer ones had got replies to 
him before he'd left God'shole habitat, each confirming that what they 
had been told of what he was asking about - which admittedly varied 
according to how much whatever collection of Minds the Not Invented 
Here was 
representing 
had 
chosen 
to 
tell 
the 
individuals 

concerned.  The information he'd received looked genuine and the 
deal he'd been offered sounded good.  At any rate, by the time he'd 
got to Tier and received all his replies he reckoned so many other 
people and Minds not irretrievably complicit with SC would have heard 
about what he'd been offered it would become impossible for SC to 
wriggle out of its deal with him without losing an unthinkable amount 
of face. 

He still suspected there was a lot more to this than he was being told, 
and he had no doubt he was and would continue to be both 
manipulated and used, but providing the price they were paying him 
was right, that didn't bother him, and at least the job itself sounded 
simple enough. 

He'd taken the precaution of checking up on the story his uncle had 
told him about the disappearing trillion-year-old sun and the orbiting 
artifact.  Sure enough, there it was; a semi-mythological story set 
way back in the archives, one of any number of weird-sounding tales 
with frustratingly little evidence to back them up.  Certainly nobody 
seemed able to explain what had happened in this case.  And of 
course there was nobody around to ask anymore.  Except for the lady 
he was travelling to talk to. 

The captain of the good ship Problem Child had indeed been a 
woman; Zreyn Tramow.  Honorary Contact Fleet Captain Gart-
Kepilesa Zreyn Enhoff Tramow Afayaf dam Niskat-west, to give her 
her official title and Full Name.  The archives held her picture.  She'd 
looked proud and capable; a pale, narrow face, with close-set eyes, 
centimetre-short blonde hair and thin lips, but smiling, and with what 
appeared to him at least to be an intelligent brightness to those 
eyes.  He liked the look of her. 

He'd wondered what it would be like to have been Stored for two-
and-a-bit millennia and then be woken up with no body to return to 
and a man you'd never seen before talking to you.  And trying to steal 
your soul. 

He'd stared at the photograph for a while, trying to see behind those 
clear blue mocking eyes. 

Around them, the Kiss The Blade and its two escorts powered their 
way through the spaces between the stars, heading for Tier habitat. 

IV 

Ulver Seich woke up in the best possible way.  She surfaced with a 
languorous slowness through fuzzy layers of luxurious half-dreams 
and memories of sweetness, sensuality and sheer carnal bliss… to 
find it all merging rather splendidly into reality, and what was 
happening right now. 

She toyed with the idea of pretending she was still asleep, but then 
he must just have touched exactly the right spot and she couldn't 
help making a noise and moving and clenching and so she rolled over 
and took his face in her hands and kissed it. 

'Oh no,' she croaked, laughing. 'Don't stop; that's a fine way to say 
good morning.' 

'Nearly afternoon,' the young man breathed.  He was called Otiel.  He 
was tall and very dark-skinned and he had fabulously blond hair and 
a voice that could raise bumps on your skin at a hundred metres, or, 
better still, millimetres.  Metaphysεics student.  Swam a lot and 
free-climbed.  The one she'd set her heart on the previous 
evening.  The leg-liker.  Long, sensiεtive fingers. 

'Hmm… Really?  Well… you know… maybe you can say that later, but 
meantime you just keep right on - WHAT?' 

Ulver Seich jerked to a sitting position, eyes wide open.  She slapped 
the young man's hand away and stared wildly around.  She was in 
what she thought of as her Romantic bed.  It was more of a chamber, 
really; a ruched, pavilion-ceilinged five-metre crimson hemisphere 
filled with billowy bolsters and slinky sheets which blended into puffy 
paddings forming the single wall of the chamber and which swelled 
out in places to form various projections, shelves, straps and little 
seat-like things.  She had other beds; her childhood bed, still stuffed 
with toys; her Just Sleep bed, comfy and surrounded by nocturne 
plants; a huge grandly formal and terribly old-fashioned canopied 
Reception bed, for when she wanted to receive friends, and an oil 
bed, which was basically a four-metre sphere of warm oils; you had 
to put little nose-plug things in and the air was Displaced into 
you.  Not to everybody's taste, sadly, but very erotic. 

Her neural lace had woken up already with the adrenaline rush.  It 
told her it was half an hour to noon.  Shit.  She'd thought she'd set 
an alarm to wake her an hour ago.  She'd meant to.  Must have 
slipped her mind due to the fun; hormonal re-prioritisation.  Well, it 
happened. 

'What… ?' Otiel said, smiling.  He was looking at her oddly.  Like he 
was wondering whether this was part of some game.  Twinkle in the 
eye.  He reached out for her. 

Damn, the gravity was still on.  She commanded the bed controls to 
switch to one-tenth G. 'Sorry!' she said, blowing him a kiss as the 
apparent gravity cut by ninety per cent.  The padding beneath their 
bodies suddenly had a lot less weight to support; the effect was to 
produce a very gentle, padded pat on the bottom which was enough 
to send them both floating fractionally upwards.  He looked 
surprised; it was such a sweet, boyish, innocent expression she 
almost stayed. 

But she didn't; she jumped out of the bed, kicking up through the air 
and raising her arms above her head to dive through the loose 
gatherings of the chamber's tented ceiling and out into the bedroom 
beyond, arcing out over the padded platform around the bed chamber 
and falling gently back into the clutches of its standard gravity.  She 
ran down the curved steps to the bedroom floor and almost bumped 
into the drone Churt Lyne. 

'I know!' she yelled, flapping one hand at it. 

It lifted out of her way, then turned smoothly and followed her across 
the floor of the bedroom towards the bathroom, its fields formal blue 
but tinged with a rosy humour. 

Ulver broke into a run.  She'd always liked big rooms; the bedroom 
one was twenty metres square and five high.  One wall was 
window.  It looked out onto a tightly curved landscape of fields and 
wooded hills dotted with towers and ziggurats.  This was Interior 
Space One, the central and longest cylinder of a cluster of 
independently revolving five-kilometre diameter tubes which formed 
the main living areas in the Rock. 

'Anything I can do?' the drone asked as Ulver ran into the 
bathroom.  Behind it, there was a shout and then a series of curses 
as the young man tried to exit the bed chamber in the same way 
Ulver had and got the gravity-transition wrong.  The drone turned 
briefly towards the disturbance, then swivelled back as Ulver's voice 
floated out through the noise of rushing fluids. 'Well, you could 
throw him out… Nicely, mind.' 

'Ulver, can I talk to you alone?' Churt Lyne said calmly, rotating to 
point at a room off the main gallery. 

'No you can't!' she yelled, throwing down the cloak she'd been 
carrying. 'Anything you have to say to me you can damn well say in 
front of my friends.' 

They were in the outer gallery of Iphetra, a long reception area lined 
with windows and old paintings; it looked out to the formal gardens 
and Interior Space One beyond.  A couple of traveltubes waited 
beyond doors set into the wall full of portraits.  She'd told everybody 
to rendezvous here.  She'd missed the noon deadline by over an 
hour, but there were certain things about one's toilet that simply 
couldn't be rushed, and - as she'd told a briefly but fetchingly 
incandescently furious Churt Lyne from her milk-bath - if she was 
really that important to all these top-secret plans, SC had no choice 
but to wait.  As a concession to the urgency of the situation she had 
left her face unadorned, tied her hair back into a simple bun and 
slipped into a conservatively patterned loose pants and jacket 
combination; even choosing her jewellery for the day had taken no 
more than five minutes. 

The gallery had got quite busy; her mother was here, tall and tousled 
in a jellaba, three cousins, seven aunts and uncles, about a dozen 

friends - all house-guests and a little bleary-eyed after the Graduation 
party - and a couple of house-slaved drones attempting to control the 
animals; a brace of tawny speytlid hunters looking about at 
everybody and snuffling and slavering with excitement and her three 
hooded but still restless alseyns which kept stretching their wings and 
giving their piercing, plangent cry.  Another drone waited outside the 
nearest window with Brave, her favourite mount, saddled up and 
pawing the ground, while the three drones she'd decided were the 
minimum she could manage with were taking care of her luggage 
trunks, which were still appearing from the house lift.  A tray floated 
at her side with breakfast; she'd just started munching on a chislen 
segment when the drone had told her she had to make this journey 
alone. 

Churt Lyne didn't reply in speech.  Instead - astonishingly - it spoke 
through her neural lace: 

~ Ulver, for pity's sake, this is a secret mission for Special 
Circumstances, not a social outing with your girlfriends. 

'And don't secret-talk me!' Ulver hissed through clenched teeth. 
'Grief, that's so rude!' 

'Quite right, dear,' muttered her mother, yawning. 

A couple of her friends laughed lightly. 

Churt Lyne came right up to her until it was almost touching her, and 
then the next thing she knew there was a sort of grey cylinder around 
her and the machine; it stretched from wooden floor to stone-carved 
ceiling and it was about a metre and a half in diameter, neatly 
enclosing her, Churt and the tray carrying breakfast.  She stared at 
the drone, her mouth open, eyes wide.  It had never done anything 
like this before!  Its aura field had disappeared.  It hadn't even had 
the decency to square the field and put the field on a mirror finish; at 
least she could have checked her appearance. 

'Sorry about this, Ulver,' the machine said.  Its voice sounded flat in 
the narrow cylinder.  Ulver closed her mouth and prodded the field 
the drone had slung around them.  It was like touching warm stone. 

'Ulver,' the drone said again, taking one of her hands in a maniple 
field, 'I apologise; I ought to have made the point earlier.  I just 
assumed… Well, never mind.  I'm supposed to come with you to Tier, 
but not anybody else.  Your friends have to stay here.' 

'But Peis and I always go deep space together!  And Klatsli is my new 
protege; I promised her she could stick around me; I can't just 
abandon her!  Do you have any idea what that could do to her 
development?  To her social life?  People might think I've dumped 
her.  Besides, she's got an utterly exquisite older brother.  If I-' 

'You can't take them,' the drone said loudly. 'They're not included in 
the invitation.' 

'I heard what you said yesterday, you know,' Ulver said, shaking her 
head and leaning forward at the drone. '"Keep it secret"; I haven't 
told them where we're going.' 

'That's not the point.  When I said don't tell a soul I meant don't tell 
a soul you're going, not don't tell a soul exactly where you're going.' 

She laughed, throwing her head back. 'Churt; real space here!  My 
diary is a public document, hadn't you noticed?  There are at least 
three channels devoted to me - all run by rather desperate young 
men, admittedly, but nevertheless.  I can't change my eye colour 
without anybody on the Rock who follows fashion knowing about it 
within the hour.  I can't just disappear!  Are you mad?' 

'And I don't think the animals can come either,' Churt Lyne said 
smoothly, ignoring her question. 'The protira certainly can't.  There 
isn't room on the ship.' 

'Isn't room?' she roared. 'What size is this thing?  Are you sure 
it's safe?' 

'Warships don't have stables, Ulver.' 

'It's an ex- war ship!' she exclaimed, waving her arms around. 'Ow!' 
She sucked at the knuckle she'd hit against the field cylinder. 

'Sorry.  But still.' 

'What about my clothes?' 

'A cabin full of clothes is perfectly all right, though I don't know for 
whose benefit you're going to be wearing them.' 

'What about when I get to Tier?' she cried. 'What about this guy I'm 
not supposed to fuck?  Am I supposed to just wander past 
him naked?' 

'Take two roomsful; three.  Clothes are not a problem, and you can 
pick up more when you get there - no, wait a minute, I know how 
long it takes you to choose new clothes; just take what you 
want.  Four cabins; there.' 

'But my friends!' 

'Tell you what; I'll show you the space you've got to work 
with.  Okay?' 

'Oh, okay,' she said, shaking her head and sighing heavily. 

The drone fed convincing-looking pictures of the ex-warship's interior 
into Ulver's brain through the neural lace. 

She caught her breath.  Her eyes were wide when the display 
stopped.  She stared at the drone. 'The rooms!' she exclaimed. 'The 
cabins; they're so small!' 

'Quite.  Still think you want to take your friends?' 

She thought for a second. 'Yes!' she yelled, thumping a fist on the 
little tray floating at her side.  It wobbled, trying not to spill the fruit 
juice.  'It'd be cozy!' 

'What if you fall out?' 

That stopped her for a moment.  She tapped her lips with one finger, 
frowning into space.  She shrugged. 'I can cut people dead in a 
traveltube, Churt.  I can ostracise people in the same bed.' She leant 

towards the machine again then glanced round at the grey walls of 
the field cylinder. 'I can ostracise people in something this big,' she 
said pointedly, her hands on her hips.  She put her head back, 
narrowed her eyes and lowered her voice. 'I could just refuse to go, 
you know.' 

'You could,' the machine said with a pronounced sigh. 'But you'd 
never get into Contact, and SC would be forced to try and get a double 
- a synthetic entity - to impersonate this woman on Tier.  The 
authorities there wouldn't be amused if they found out.' 

She gazed levelly at the machine for a moment.  She sighed and 
shook her head. 'Bugger,' she breathed, snatching the glass of fruit 
juice from the floating tray and looking in distaste at where the juice 
had run down the outside of the glass. 'I hate this acting adult shit.' 
She knocked the juice back, set the glass back down and licked her 
lips. 'Okay; let's go, let's go!' 

Eventually, though, Ulver had said her farewells, decided to leave all 
her animals and two trunks of clothes behind and then - having 
remained serene in the midst of much hullabaloo and some tears from 
Klatsli - entered a traveltube with a frostily blue Churt Lyne and was 
taken to the Forward Docks and a big, brightly lit hangar, where the 
Psychopath Class ex-Rapid Offensive Unit Frank Exchange of 
Views was waiting for her. 

Ulver laughed. 'It looks,' she snorted, 'like a dildo!' 

'That's appropriate,' Churt Lyne said. 'Armed, it can fuck solar 
systems.' 

She and Churt Lyne stood in the ship's tiny hangar area, surrounded 
by her cases, bags and trunks as well as a deal of plain but somehow 
menacing-looking bits and pieces of military equipment.  The way 
that stone had fallen towards the dark water then, shrinking and 
shrinking, was very like the way Phage Rock fell silently away from 
the old warship now. 

This time, of course, there was no splash. 

When Phage had entirely disappeared, she switched out of the view 
her neural lace had imported into her head and turned to the drone, 
thinking a thought that would have occurred to her a lot earlier, she 
hoped, if she'd been sober and unimpassioned over the last day. 

'When was this ship sent to Phage, Churt, and from where?' 

'Why don't you ask it yourself?' it said, turning to indicate a small 
drone approaching over the jumble of equipment. 

~ Churt? she asked via the neural lace. 

~ Yes? 

~ Damn; I was hoping the ship's rep might be a dazzling handsome 
young man.  Instead it's something that looks like a- 

Churt Lyne interrupted: 

~ Ulver; you are aware that the ship itself acts as exchange hub for 
these communications? 

~ Oh dear, she thought, and felt herself colour as the little drone 
approached.  She smiled broadly at it. 

'No offence,' she said. 

'None taken,' said the little machine as it came to a halt in front of 
her.  It had a reedy but reasonably melodious voice. 

'For the record,' she said, still smiling, and still blushing, 'I thought 
you looked a bit like a jewellery box.' 

'Could have been worse,' chipped in Churt Lyne. 'You should hear 
what she calls me sometimes.' 

The little drone's snout dipped once in a sort of bow. 'That's quite all 
right, Ms Seich,' it said. 'Delighted to meet you.  Allow me to welcome 
you aboard the Very Fast Picket Frank Exchange of Views.' 

'Thank you,' she said, also nodding slowly. 'I was just asking my 
friend where you'd come from, and when you'd been dispatched.' 

'I didn't come from anywhere except Phage,' the ship told her. 

She felt her eyes widen. 'Really?' 

'Really,' it said laconically. 'And the answer to your next three 
questions, I'd guess, are: because I was very well hidden and that's 
actually quite easy in a conglomeration of matter the size of Phage; 
getting on for five hundred years; and there are another fifteen like 
me back home.  I trust you are reassured rather than shocked and 
that we may rely on your discretion in the future.' 

'Oh, golly, absolutely,' she said, nodding, and felt half inclined to click 
her heels and salute. 

V 

Dajeil had been spending a lot more time with the beasts.  She swam 
with the great fish and the sea-evolved mammals and reptiles, she 
donned a flyer suit and cruised high above the sea with her wide 
wings extended alongside the dirigible creatures in the calm currents 
of air and the cloud layers, and she donned a full gelfield suit with a 
secondary AG unit and carved her way amongst the poison gases, the 
acid clouds and the storm bands of the upper atmosphere, 
surrounded by noxiousness and the ferocious beauty of the 
ecosystem there. 

She even spent some time walking in the ship's top-side parks, the 
nature reserves which the Sleeper Service had possessed even when 
it had been a regular, well-behaved GSV and diligent member of the 
Contact section; the parks - complete landscapes with hills, forests, 
plains, river and lake systems and the remains of small resort villages 
and hotels - covered all the great ship's flat top surfaces and together 
measured over eight hundred square kilometres.  With the humans 
gone from the ship there were fairly large populations of land animals 
in the park lands, including grazers, predators and scavengers. 

She'd never really paid any of them much attention - her interests 
had always been with the larger, buoyant animals of the fluid 
environments - but now that they were all likely to suffer the same 
exile or unconsciousness as the rest, she had started to take a 
belated, almost guilty interest in them (as though, she thought 
ruefully, her attention bestowed some special significance on the 
behaviour she witnessed, or meant anything at all to the creatures 
concerned). 

Amorphia did not come for its regular visit; another couple of days 
passed. 

When the avatar came to her again, she had been swimming with the 
purple-winged triangular rays in the shallow part of the sea extending 
beyond the sheer, three-kilometre cliff which was the rear of the 
craft.  Returning, she had taken the flyer which the ship habitually 
put at her disposal, but asked it to drop her at the top of the scree 
slope beneath the cliff facing the tower. 

It was a bright, cold day and the air tasted sharp; this part of the 
ship's environment was cycling towards winter; all the trees save for 
a few everblues had lost their leaves, and soon the snows would 
come. 

The air was very clear and from the top of the scree slope she could 
see the Edge islands, thirty kilometres away, out close to where the 
inner containment field of the ship came down like a wall across the 
sea. 

She had scrambled down the scree in small rattles of stones like dry, 
fanning rivers of pebbles and dust.  She had long ago learned how to 
use her altered centre of gravity to her advantage in this sort of 
adventure, and had never yet fallen badly.  She got to the bottom, 
her heart beating hard, her leg muscles warm with the effort 
expended and her skin bright with sweat.  She walked quickly back 
through the salt marsh, along the paths the ship had fashioned for 
her. 

The sun-line was near setting when she returned to the tower, 
breathless and still perspiring.  She took a shower and was sitting by 
the log fire the tower had lit for her, letting her hair dry naturally, 
when Gravious the black bird rapped once on the window and then 
disappeared again. 

She pulled her robe tighter about her as the tall, dark-dressed figure 
of Amorphia climbed the stairs and entered the room. 

'Amorphia,' she said, tucking her wet hair into the hood of the robe. 
'Hello.  Can I get you anything?' 

'No.  No, thank you,' the avatar said, looking nervously around the 
circular living room. 

Dajeil indicated a chair while she sat on a couch by the fire. 

'Please.' She pulled her legs up underneath her. 'So, what brings you 
here today?' 

'I -' the avatar began, then stopped, and pulled at its lower lip with 
its fingers. 'Well, it seems,' it started again, then hesitated once 
more.  It took a breath. 'The time,' it said, then stopped, looking 
confused. 

'The time?' Dajeil Gelian said. 

'It's… it's come,' Amorphia said, and looked ashamed. 

'For the changes you talked about?' 

'Yes,' 
the 
avatar 
said, 
sounding 
relieved. 
'Yes.  For 
the 

changes.  They have to start now.  In fact, they have already 
begun.  The rounding-up of the creatures comes first, and the…' It 
looked unsure again, and frowned deeply. 'The… the de-landscaping,' 
it gulped.  It tripped up on the next words in its rush to say them. 
'The 
un-geometri-… 
The 
un-geomorphologising.  The… 
the 

pristinisation!' it said, almost shouting. 

Dajeil smiled, trying not to show the alarm she felt. 'I see,' she said 
slowly. 'So it is all definitely going to happen?' 

'Yes,' Amorphia said, breathing heavily. 'Yes, it is.' 

'And I will have to leave the ship?' 

'Yes.  You'll have to leave the ship.  I… I'm sorry.' The avatar looked 
suddenly crestfallen. 

'Where am I to go?' 

'Where?' Confused. 

'Where are you going to stop, or where will I be taken?  Is it another 
ship, or a habitat, or an O or a planet, a rock?  What?' 

'I…' The avatar frowned again. 'The ship does not know yet,' it said. 
'Things are being worked out.' 

Dajeil looked at Amorphia for a while, her hands absently stroking 
the bulge of her belly under her robe. 'What is happening, Amorphia?' 
she asked, keeping her voice soft. 'Why is all this taking place?' 

'I can't… there is no need… no need for you to know,' the avatar said 
hesitantly.  It looked exasperated, and shook its head as though 
angry, gaze flicking up and around the room, as though seeking 
something. 

Finally it looked back at her. 'I might be able to tell you more, later, 
if you will agree to stay on board until… until a time comes when I 
can only evacuate you by another vessel.' 

She smiled. 'That sounds like no great hardship.  Does that mean I 
can stay here longer?' 

'Not here; the tower and everything else will have gone; it will mean 
living inside.  Inside the GSV.' 

Dajeil shrugged. 'All right.  I suppose I can suffer that.  When will 
that have to happen?' 

'In a day or two,' Amorphia said.  Then the avatar looked concerned, 
and sat forward on the seat. 'There… it's possible… it's possible 
there… might be a slightly increased risk to you, staying aboard until 
then.  The ship will do all it can to minimise that, of course, but the 
possibility exists.  And it might be…' Amorphia's head shook 
suddenly. 'I - the ship, would like you to remain on board, if possible, 
until then.  It might be… important.  Good.' The avatar looked as 
though it had startled itself.  Dajeil suddenly recalled having held a 
tiny baby when it had farted loudly; the look of utter, blinking surprise 
on its face was not dissimilar to that on Amorphia's face now.  Dajeil 
choked back an urge to laugh, and it disappeared anyway when, as 
though prompted by the thought, her child kicked within her.  She 
clamped a hand to her belly. 'Yes,' Amorphia said, nodding 
vigorously. 'It would be good if you stayed on board…  Good might 
come of it altogether.' It sat staring at her, panting as though from 
exertion. 

'Then I had better stay, hadn't I?' Dajeil said, again keeping her voice 
steady and calm. 

'Yes,' said the avatar. 'Yes; I'd appreciate that.  Thank you.' It stood 
up suddenly from the seat, as though released by a spring 
within.  Dajeil was startled; she almost jumped. 'I must go now,' 
Amorphia said. 

Dajeil swung her legs out and stood too, more slowly. 'Very well,' she 
said as the avatar made its way to the staircase set onto the wall of 
the tower. 'I hope you'll tell me more later.' 

'Of course,' the avatar mumbled, then it turned and bowed quickly 
and was gone, bootsteps clattering down the stairs. 

The door slammed some moments later. 

Dajeil Gelian climbed the steps to the parapet of the tower.  A breeze 
caught her robe's hood and spilled her heavy, still-wet hair out and 
down.  The sun-line had set, throwing highlights of gold and ruby 
light across the sky and turning the starboard horizon into a fuzzy 
violet border.  The wind stiffened.  It felt cold. 

Amorphia was not walking back this evening; after the creature had 
hurried up the narrow path through the tower's walled garden and 
out of the land-gate, it just rose up into the air, without any obvious 
AG pack or flying suit, and then accelerated through the air in a dark, 
thin blur, curving through the air to disappear a few seconds later 
over the edge of the cliff beyond. 

Dajeil looked up.  There were tears in her eyes, which annoyed 
her.  She sniffed them back angrily and wiped her cheeks.  A few 
blinks, and the view of the sky was steady and unobscured again. 

It had indeed already begun. 

A flight of the dirigible creatures were dropping down from the red-
speckled clouds above her, heading for the cliffs.  Looking closely, 
she 
could 
see 
the 
accompanying 
drones 
that 
were 
their 

herders.  Doubtless the same scene was being repeated at this 

moment both beneath the grey surface of the sea on the far side of 
the tower as well as above, in the region of furious heat and crushing 
pressure that was the gas-giant environment. 

The dirigible creatures hesitated in the skies above; in front of them, 
a whole area of the cliff, perhaps a kilometre across and half that in 
height, simply folded in on itself in four parcel-neat sections and 
disappeared backwards into four huge, long glowing halls.  The 
reassured dirigible creatures were shepherded towards one of the 
opened bays.  Elsewhere, other parts of the cliffs were performing 
similar tricks; lights sparkled in the spaces revealed.  The entire 
swathe of grey-brown scree - easily twenty kilometres across and a 
hundred metres in both depth and height - was folding and tipping in 
eight gigantic Vs and channelling several billion tonnes of real-enough 
rock into eight presumably reinforced ship bays, doubtless to undergo 
whatever transformational process was in store for the sea and the 
gas-giant atmosphere. 

A titanic, bone-resounding tremor shook the ground and rumεbled 
over the tower while huge clouds of dust leapt billowing into the chilly 
air as the rock disappeared.  Dajeil shook her head - her wet hair 
flapping on the sodden shoulders of her robe - then walked towards 
the doorway which led to the rest of the tower, intending to retreat 
there before the clouds of stone dust arrived. 

The black bird Gravious made to settle on her shoulder; she shooed 
it off and it landed flapping uproariously on the edge of the opened 
trap door. 

'My tree!' it screamed, hopping from leg to leg. 'My tree!  They've - I 
- my - it's gone!' 

'Too bad,' she said.  The sound of another great tumble of falling rock 
split the skies. 'Stay wherever it puts me,' she told the bird. 'If it'll let 
you.  Now get out of my way.' 

'But my food for the winter!  It's gone!' 

''Winter has gone, you stupid bird,' she told it.  The black bird 
stopped moving and just perched there, head thrown forward and to 

one side, right eye staring at her, as though trying to catch some 
more meaningful echo of what she had just told it. 'Oh, don't worry,' 
she said. 'I'm sure you'll be accommodated.' She waved it off its perch 
and it flapped noisily away. 

A last earthquake of sound rolled under and over the tower.  The 
woman Dajeil Gelian looked round at the twilight-lit rolling grey dust 
clouds to see the light from opened bays beyond shine through, as 
the pretence at natural form was dispensed with and the overall 
shape of the craft's fabric began to reveal itself. 

The Culture General Systems Vehicle Sleeper Service. No longer just 
her gallant protector and a grossly over-specified mobile game 
reserve… It seemed that the great ship had finally found something 
to become involved with which was more in keeping with the extent 
of its powers.  She wished it well, though with trepidation. 

The sea like stone, she thought.  She turned and stepped down into 
the warmth of the tower, patting the bulge that was her sleeping, 
undreaming child. A stern winter indeed; harder than any of us had 
anticipated. 

VI 

Leffid Ispanteli was trying desperately to remember the name of the 
lass he was with.  Geltry?  Usper?  Stemli? 

'Oh, 
yes, 
yes, 
ffffuck!  Gods, yes! 
More, 
more; 
now, 

yes!  There!  There!  Yes!  That's oohhh… !' 

Soli?  Getrin?  Ayscoe? 

'Oh, fuck!  There!  More!  Harder!  Right… right… now! …Aah!' 

Selas?  Serayer? (Grief; how ungallant of him!) 

'Oh, sweet providence!  Oh FUCK!' 

No wonder he couldn't think of her name; the girl was kicking up such 
a racket he was surprised he could think at all.  Still, a chap shouldn't 

grumble, he supposed; always nice to be appreciated.  Even if it was 
the yacht that was doing most of the work. 

The diminutive hire yacht continued to shudder and buck beneath 
them, spiralling and curving through space a few hundred kilometres 
away from the huge stepped world that was Tier. 

Leffid had used these little yachts for this sort of thing before; if you 
fed a nicely jagged course into their computers they'd do most of the 
bumping and grinding for you while leaving just enough apparent 
gravity 
to 
brace 
oneself 
without 
leaving 
one 
feeling 

terribly heavy. Programming in the odd power-off interval gave 
moments of delicious free-fall, and drew the small craft further away 
from the great world, so that gradually the view beyond the viewing 
ports increased in majesty as more and more of the conical habitat 
was revealed, turning slowly and glittering in the light of the system's 
sun.  Altogether a wonderful way of having sex, really, providing one 
found a suitable and willing partner. 

'Aw!  Aw! Aaawww! Force!  Push, push, push; yes!' 

She held his thrusting hips, smoothed his feathered scalp and used 
her other hand turned out to stroke his lower belly.  Her huge dark 
eyes glittered, myriad tiny lights sparkling somewhere inside them in 
pulsing vortexes of colour and intensity that varied charmingly with 
the intensity of her pleasure. 

'Come on!  Yes!  Come on up; further!  Further!  Aaarrrhh.' 

Dammit all; what was her name? 

Geldri?  Shokas?  Esiel? 

Grief; what if it wasn't even a Culture name?  He'd been certain it 
was but now he was starting to think maybe it wasn't after all.  That 
made it even more difficult.  More excusable, maybe, too, but 
certainly more difficult too. 

They'd met at the Homomdan Ambassador's party to celebrate the 
start of the six-hundred and forty-fifth Festival of Tier.  He'd resolved 

to have his neural lace removed for the month of the Festival, 
deciding that as this year's theme was Primitivism he ought to give 
up some aspect of his amendments.  The neural lace had been his 
choice because although there was no physical alteration and he 
looked just the same to everybody else, he'd reckoned he'd feel more 
different. 

Which he did.  It was oddly liberating to have to ask things or people 
for information and not know precisely what the time was and where 
he was located in the habitat.  But it also meant that he was forced 
to rely on his own memory for things like people's names.  And how 
imperfect was the unassisted human memory (he'd forgotten)! 

He'd even thought of having his wings removed too, at least partly 
to show that he was taking part in the spirit of the Festival, but in the 
end he'd stuck with them.  Probably just as well; this girl had made 
a big thing about the wings; headed straight for him, masked, body 
glittering.  She was nearly as tall as he was, perfectly proportioned, 
and she had four arms!  A drink in each hand, too.  His kind of female, 
he'd decided instantly, even as she was looking admiringly at his 
folded, snow-white wings.  She wore some sort of gelsuit; basically 
deep blue but covered with a pattern like gold wire wrapped all over 
it and dotted with little diamonds of contrasting, subtly glowing 
red.  Her whiskered mask was porcelain-bone studded with rubies 
and finished with iridescent badra feathers.  Stunning perfume. 

She handed him a glass and took off her mask to reveal eyes the size 
of opened mouths; eyes softly, blackly featureless in the lustrous 
lights of the vibrantly decorated dome until he'd looked carefully and 
seen the tiny hints of lights within their curved surfaces.  The gelfield 
suit covered her everywhere except those heavily altered eyes and a 
small hole at the back of her head where a plait of long, shiningly 
auburn hair spilled out.  Wrapped in gold wire, it ended at the small 
of her back and was tethered to the suit there. 

She'd said her first name; the gelsuit's lips had parted to show white 
teeth and a pink tongue. 

'Leffid,' he'd replied, bowing deeply but watching her face as best he 
could while he did so.  She'd looked up at his wings as they'd risen 

up and towards her over the plain black robe he'd worn.  He'd seen 
her take a deep breath.  The lights in her eyes had sparkled brightly. 

Ah-ha! he'd thought. 

The Homomdan ambassador had turned the riotously decoεrated, 
stadium-sized bowl that was her residential quarters into an old-
fashioned fun-fair for the party.  They had wandered through the 
acts, tents and rides, he and she, talking small talk, passing comment 
on other people they passed, celebrating the refreshing absence of 
drones at the party, discussing the merits of whirligigs, shubblebubs, 
helter-skelters, ice-flumes, quittletraps, slicicles, boing-braces, 
airblows, tramplescups and bodyflaggers, and bemoaning the sheer 
pointlessness of inter-species funny-face competitions. 

She was on an improving tour from her home Orbital, cruising and 
learning with a party of friends on a semi-Eccentric ship that would 
be here as long as the Festival lasted.  One of her aunts had some 
Contact contacts and had swung an invitation to the ambassador's 
celebration; her friends were so jealous.  He guessed she was still in 
her teens, though she moved with the easy grace of somebody older 
and her conversation was more intelligent and even shrewder than 
he'd have expected.  He was used to being able to almost switch off 
talking to most teenagers but he was having to race after her 
meanings and allusions at time.  Were teenagers getting even 
smarter?  Maybe he was just getting old!  No matter; she obviously 
liked the wings.  She asked to stroke them. 

He told her he was a resident of Tier, Culture or ex-Culture depending 
how you wanted to look at it; it wasn't something he bothered about, 
though he supposed if forced he felt more loyalty to Tier, where he'd 
lived for twenty years, than to the Culture, where he'd lived for the 
rest of his life.  In the AhForgetlt Tendency, that was, not the Culture 
proper, which the Tendency regarded as being far too serious and not 
nearly as dedicated to hedonistic pursuits as it ought to be.  He'd first 
come here as part of a Tendency cultural mission, but stayed when 
the rest returned back to their home Orbital. (He'd thought about 
saying, Well, actually I was in the Tendency's equivalent of Special 
Circumstances, kind of a spy, really, and I know lots of secret codes 

and stuff… but that probably wasn't the sort of line that would work 
with a sophisticated girl like this.) 

Oh, much older than her; quite middle-aged, at one hundred and 
forty.  Well, that was kind of her to say so.  Yes, the wings worked, 
in anything less than 50% standard gravity.  Had them since he was 
thirty.  He lived on an air level here with 30% gravity. Huge web-
trees up there.  Some people lived in their hollowed-out fruit husks, 
though he preferred a sort of wispy house-thing made from sheets of 
chaltressor silk stretched over hi-pressure thinbooms.  Oh yes, she'd 
be very welcome to see it. 

Had she seen much of Tier?  Arrived yesterday?  Such good timing 
for the Festival!  He'd love to be her guide.  Why not now?  Why 
not.  They could hire a yacht.  First though they would go and make 
their apologies to the Ambassador.  Of course; he and she were old 
pals.  Something to tell that aunt of hers.  And they'd call by the 
cruise ship; bring the others?  Oh, just a little camera drone?  Well 
why not?  Yes, Tier's rules could be tiresome at times, couldn't they? 

'Yes!  Yes!  Yeeehhhsss…' 

That was him; she'd given one final, ear-splitting shriek and then 
gone limp, with just a huge grin on her gelsuited face (she'd kept it 
on, another aperture had obligingly opened).  Time to bring this bout 
to a climax… 

The yacht had served him before; it heard what he said and took that 
as a signal to cut engines and go into free-fall.  He loved technology. 

The neural lace would have handled his orgasm sequence better, 
controlling the flow of secretions from his drug glands so that they 
more precisely matched and enhanced the extended human-basic 
physiological process taking place, but it was still pretty damn good 
all the same; his didn't last quite as long as hers obviously had, but 
he'd put it at over a minute, easily. 

He floated, still joined to her, watching the smile on her face and the 
tiny, dim lights in the huge dark eyes.  Her fabulous chest heaved 
now and again; her four arms waved round with a graceful, under-

sea motion.  After a while, one of her hands went to the nape of her 
neck.  She took the gelsuit's head off and let it float free. 

The deep dark eyes stayed; the rest of her face was brown flushed 
with red, and quite beautiful.  He smiled at her.  She smiled back. 

With the gelsuit's head removed, a little sweat beaded on her 
forehead and top lip.  He gently fanned her face with his wings, 
bringing them sweeping softly from behind his shoulders and then 
back.  The huge eyes regarded him for a while, then she put her head 
back, stretching and sighing.  A couple of pink cushions floated past, 
bumping into her floating arms and ricocheting slowly away. 

The yacht's hire-limit warning chimed; it wasn't allowed to stray too 
far from Tier.  He'd already told it to cruise back in when it hit the 
limit; it duly fired its engines and they were pressed back into the 
slickly warm surfaces of the couches and cushions in a delicious 
tangle of limbs for a while.  The girl wriggled with a succulent 
slowness, eyes quite dark now. 

He looked over to one side and saw the little camera drone she'd 
brought, sitting on the ledge under one of the diamond view ports, 
its one beady eye still fastened on the two of them.  He winked at it. 

Something moved outside, in the darkness, amongst the slow 
wheeling turn of stars.  He watched it for a while.  The yacht 
murmured, engine firing quietly; some apparent gravity stuck him 
and the girl to the ceiling for a second or two, then weightlessness 
returned.  The girl made a couple of small noises that might have 
indicated she was asleep, and seemed to relax inside, letting go of 
him.  He pulled her closer with his arms while his wings beat once, 
twice, bringing them both closer to the view port. 

Outside, close, by, a ship was passing by, heading inbound on its final 
approach for Tier.  They must have been almost directly in its path; 
the yacht's engine-burn had been avoidance action.  Leffid looked 
down at the sleeping girl, wondering if he ought to wake her so that 
she could watch; there was something magical about seeing this 
great craft going sliding silently by, its dark, spectacularly 
embellished hull slicing space just a hundred metres away. 

He had an idea, and grinned to himself and stretched out his hand to 
take the little camera drone - currently getting a fine view of the lass's 
backside and his balls - and turn it round, point it out the view port 
at the passing ship, so that she would have a surprise when she 
watched her recording, but then something else caught his attention, 
and his hand never did touch the camera drone. 

Instead he stared out of the port, his eyes fastened on a section of 
the vessel's hull. 

The ship passed on by.  He kept staring out into space. 

The girl sighed and moved; two of her arms went out and drew his 
face towards hers; she squeezed him from inside. 

'Wooooo,' she breathed, and kissed him.  Their first real kiss, without 
the gelsuit over her face.  Eyes still enchanting, oceanically deep and 
enchanting… 

Estray. Her name was Estray.  Of course.  Common enough name for 
an uncommonly attractive girl.  Here for a month, eh?  Leffid 
congratulated himself.  This could end up being a good Festival. 

They started caressing each other again. 

6. Pittance 

I 

Ulver Seich sobbed into her pillow.  She had felt bad before; her 
mother had refused her something, some lad had - unbelievably - 

preferred somebody else to her (admittedly very rare), she had felt 
terribly alone, exposed and vulnerable the first time she had camped 
out under the stars on a planet, and various pets had died… but 
nothing as terrible as this. 

She raised her tear-marked face up from the sodden pillow and 
looked again at her reflection in the reverser field on the walk-in 
across the horribly small cabin.  She saw her face again and howled 
with anguish, burying her head in the pillow once again and bashing 
her feet up and down on the under-cover, which wobbled like a jelly 
in the AG field, trying to compensate. 

Her face had been altered.  While she'd slept, during the night, one 
day out from Phage.  Her face, her beautiful, heart-shaped, heart-
winning, heart-melting, heart-breaking face, the face which she had 
sat and gazed at in a mirror or a reverser field for hours at a time on 
occasion when she'd been old enough for her drug glands to come on 
line and young enough to experiment with them, the face she had 
gazed at and gazed at not because she was stoned but because she 
was just so damned lovely… her face had been made to look like 
somebody else's.  And there was worse. 

It might be hurting a little now if she wasn't keeping the pain turned 
off, but that wasn't what mattered; what mattered was that her face 
was: a) puffy, swollen and discoloured after the nanotechs had done 
their work, b) not her own any longer, and, c) older!  The woman she 
was supposed to look like was older than she!  Much older!  Sixty 
years older! 

People claimed that nobody in the Culture really changed much in 
appearance between about twenty-five and two hundred and fifty 
(then there was a slow but sure ageing to the three-fifty, four 
hundred mark, by which time your hair would be white (or gone!) 
your skin would be wrinkled like some basic's scrotum and your tits 
swinging round your belly-button - ugh!) but she had always been 
able to tell how old people were; she was rarely more than five or ten 
years out - never more than twenty, at any rate - and she 
could see how old she was now, even beneath the puffiness and 
shadowy bruising; she was seeing how she would look when she was 
older, and it didn't matter that it wasn't her own face, it didn't matter 

that she would probably look much better than this by the time she 
was in her mid-eighties (she had pictures of 99.9 per cent certain 
projections 
prepared 
for 
her 
by 
the 
house 
AI 
which 

showed exactly how she'd look at every decade for two centuries 
ahead, and they looked great); what mattered was that she looked 
old and dowdy and that would make her feel old and dowdy and 
therefore that would make her behave old and dowdy, and that 
feeling and that way of behaving and therefore that look might not 
go away when she was returned to her normal, her natural, 
her own appearance. 

This wasn't turning out as she'd hoped at all; no friends, no pets, no 
fun, and the more she thought about it, the riskier it all might be, the 
less certain she was what she was getting into.  This whole thing was 
supposed to be an adventure, but this part on the ship was just boring 
and so would the return journey be as well, and in the middle lay 
who-knew-what?  Everybody knew how devious SC was; what were 
they really up to, what did they really want her to do?  Even if it did 
turn out to be somehow exciting and even fun, she wouldn't be 
allowed to tell anybody about it, and where was the point in fun if you 
couldn't talk about it later? 

Of course, she could tell other people, but then she wouldn't be able 
to stay in Contact.  Hell, Churt was being ambiguous about whether 
she was in it now or not.  Well was she or wasn't she?  Was this a 
real Contact and even SC mission she was engaged in - as she'd 
dreamed of, fantasised about since early childhood - or some 
extracurricular wheeze, even a test of some sort? 

She bit the pillow, and the particular texture of the fabric in her mouth 
and between her teeth, and the sensation of her face being puffed-
up while her eyes stung with tears, took her back to childhood again. 

She raised her head, licking her top lip clear of the salty fluid, and 
then snorted and sniffed back both the tears and the snot that was 
filling her nose.  She thought about glanding some calm, but decided 
not to.  She did some deep breathing, then swivelled round on the 
bed and sat up and looked at herself in the reverser, raising her chin 
at the hideous image it showed and sniffing again and wiping her face 
with her hands and swallowing hard and fluffing out her hair (at least 

it could stay as it was), sniffing again, and stared herself in the eyes 
and forbade herself to cry or look away. 

After a few minutes, her cheeks had dried and her eyes were coming 
clear again, losing their red puffiness.  She was still abhorrently ugly 
and even disfigured by her own high standards, but she was not a 
child and she was still the same person inside.  Ah well.  She 
supposed a little suffering might do her some good. 

She had always been pampered; all her hardships had been self-
inflicted and recreational in the past.  She had gone hungry and 
unwashed when hiking somewhere primitive, but there had always 
been food at the end of the day, and a shower or at the very least a 
peelspray to remove the grime and sweat. 

Even the pain of what had felt on occasion like an irretrievably broken 
heart had consistently proved less lasting than she'd initially imagined 
and expected; the revelation that a boy's taste was so grotesquely 
deficient he could prefer somebody else to her always reduced both 
the intensity and the duration of the anguish her heart demanded be 
endured to mark such a loss of regard. 

She had always known there were too few real challenges in her life, 
too few genuine risks; it had all been too easy, even by Culture 
standards.  While her life-style and material circumstances in Phage 
had been no different from that of any other person her age, it was 
true that just because the Culture was so determinedly egalitarian, 
what little hierarchic instinct remained in the population of the Rock 
manifested itself in the ascription of a certain cachet to belonging to 
one of the Founder Families. 

In a society in which it was possible to look however one wanted to 
look, acquire any talent one wished to acquire and have access to as 
much property as one might desire, it was generally accepted that 
the only attributes which possessed that particular quality of interest 
which derives solely from their being difficult to attain were entry into 
Contact and Special Circumstances, or having some familial link with 
the Culture's early days. 

Even the most famous and gifted of artists - whether their talents 
were congenital or acquired - were not regarded in quite the same 
hallowed light as Contact members (and, somewhere really old, like 
Phage, direct descendants of Founders).  Being a famous artist in the 
Culture meant at best it was accepted you must possess a certain 
gritty determination; at worst it was generally seen as pointing to a 
pitiably archaic form of insecurity and a rather childish desire to show 
off. 

When there were almost no distinctions to be drawn between people's 
social standing, the tiny differences that did exist became all the more 
important, to those who cared. 

Ulver's feelings about her family's ancient name were mostly 
negative.  Admittedly, possessing an old name meant some people 
were prepared to make an advance on any respect they might come 
to feel was rightly your due, but on the other hand Ulver wanted to 
be admired, worshipped and lusted after for herself, just her, just this 
current collection of cells, right here, with no reference to the 
inheritance those cells carried. 

And what was the point of having what was sometimes insultingly 
referred to as an advantage in life if it couldn't even smooth your way 
into Contact?  If anything, it had been hinted, it was a disadvantage; 
she would have to do better than the average person, she would have 
to be so completely, utterly, demonstrably perfect for the Contact 
Section that there could be no question of anybody ever thinking 
she'd got in because the people and machines on the admissions 
board knew the name Seich from their history lessons. 

Well, Churt had been right; this was her big chance.  She had been 
and would be unamendedly beautiful, she was intelligent, charming 
and attractive and she had common sense by the bucket-load, but 
she couldn't expect to breeze this the way she had breezed 
everything else in her, life so far; she'd work at it, she'd study, she'd 
be diligent, assiduous and industrious and all the other things she'd 
worked so hard at not being while ensuring that her university results 
had sparkled as brilliantly as her social life. 

Maybe she had been a spoiled brat; maybe she still was a spoiled 
brat, but she was a ruthlessly determined spoiled brat, and if that 
ruthless determination dictated ditching spoiled brathood, then out it 
would go, faster than you could say 'Bye. 

Ulver dried her eyes, collected herself - still without the help of any 
glandular secretions - then got up and left the cabin.  She would sit 
in the lounge where there was more space, and there she would find 
out all she could about Tier, this man Genar-Hofoen, and anything 
else that might be relevant to what they wanted her to do. 

II 

Leffid Ispanteli eased himself into the seat beside the vice-consul for 
the AhForgetlt Tendency, carefully hooking his wings over the seat 
back and smiling at the vice-consul, who regarded him with that 
particular kind of vacant look people tend to assume when they're 
communicating by neural lace. 

Leffid held up his hand. 'Words, I'm afraid, Lellius,' he said. 'Had my 
lace removed for the Festival.' 

'Very primitive,' vice-consul Lellius said approvingly, nodding gravely 
and returning his attention to the race. 

They were sitting in a carousel suspended beneath a vast carbon-
tubed structure sculpted in the image of a web tree; the thousands 
of viewing carousels dangled like fruit from the canopy and were 
multifariously connected by a secondary web of delicate, swaying 
cable bridges.  The view beneath and to either side was of a series of 
great steps of stone dotted with vegetation and moving figures; it 
was very like looking at an ancient amphitheatre which had been 
lifted from the horizontal to the vertical and each of whose seat levels 
was able to rotate independently.  The moving figures were ysner-
mistretl combinations; the ysners were the huge two-legged flightless 
(and almost brainless) birds doing the running while their thinking 
was done by the mistretl jockey each carried on its back.  Mistretls 
were tiny and almost helpless but brainy simians and the combination 
of one of them per ysner was a naturally occurring one from a planet 
in the Lower Leaf Spiral. 

Ysner-mistretl races had been a part of life on Tier for millennia, and 
running them on a giant mandala two kilometres across composed of 
steps or levels all rotating at different speeds had been traditional for 
most of that time.  The huge slowly turning race-course looked a little 
like Tier itself, which took its name from its shape. 

Tier was a stepped habitat; its nine levels all revolved at the same 
speed, but that meant that the outer tiers possessed greater apparent 
gravity than those nearer the centre.  The levels themselves were 
sectioned into compartments up to hundreds of kilometres long and 
filled with atmospheres of different types and held at different 
temperatures, while a stunningly complicated and dazzlingly beautiful 
array of mirrors and mirrorfields situated within the staggered cone 
of the world's axis provided amounts of sunlight precisely timed, 
attenuated and where necessary altered in wavelength to mimic the 
conditions on a hundred different worlds for a hundred different 
intelligent species. 

This environmental diversity and the civilisational co-depenεdence it 
implied and intermingling it encouraged had been Tier's raison d'être, 
the very foundation of its purpose and fame for the seven thousand 
years it had existed.  Its original builders were, perεhaps, unknown; 
they were believed to have Sublimed shortly after building it, leaving 
behind a species - or model, depending how you defined these things 
- of biomechanical sintricate which ran and maintained the place, 
were individually dull but collectively highly intelligent, took the shape 
of a small sphere covered with long articulated spines, were between 
half a metre and two metres in size and had seemed to have an 
intense suspicion of anything possessing less of a biological basis than 
they did themselves.  Drones and other AIs were tolerated on Tier 
but very closely watched, followed everywhere and their every 
communication and even thought monitored.  Minds were immune to 
this sort of treatment of course, but their avatars tended to attract a 
degree of intense physical observation which bordered on 
harassment, and so they rarely bothered entering the world itself, 
sticking to the outer docks where they were made perfectly welcome 
and afforded every hospitality.  Tier, after all, was a statement, a 
treasure, a symbol, and as such any small discriminatory foibles it 
chose to display were considered perfectly tolerable. 

The ysner-mistretl race track was one level up from the tier where 
the Homomdan mission was housed and three levels down from 
Leffid's home circumference. 

'Leffid,' the vice consul said.  He was a rotund, massy male of 
apparently indeterminate species, vaguely human in shape but with 
a triangular head and an eye at each corner.  His skin was bright red; 
the flowing robes he wore were a vivid but gradually shifting shade 
of blue.  He turned his head slightly so that two of his eyes regarded 
Leffid while the third continued to watch the race. 'Did I see you at 
the Homomdan do last night?  I can't remember.' 

'Briefly,' Leffid said. 'I waved Hello but you were busy with the 
Ashpartzi delegate.' 

Vice-consul Lellius wheezed with laughter. 'Trying to hold the blighter 
down.  It was having buoyancy problems inside its new suit; 
automatics weren't really up to the job with the AI removed.  Terrible 
thing when one of these gas-giant floater beasties suffers from 
flatulence, you know.' 

Leffid recalled that Lellius had rather looked as though he'd been 
wrestling with the bow-rope for what appeared to be a small airship 
at the Homomdan ambassador's party. 'Not as terrible as it must be 
for the inhabitant of the suit, I'd guess.' 

'Ha, indeed,' Lellius chuckled, nodding and wheezing. 'May I order 
you some refreshment?' 

'No, thank you.' 

'Good; I have given up emoter-keyed foods and drinks for the 
duration of the Festival and would only be jealous.' He shook his head. 
'I thought primitives were supposed to have more fun, but everything 
I could think of changing the better to partake in the Festival's spirit 
seemed to make life less fun,' he said, then made a tutting noise at 
something on the race course. 

Leffid looked to see one of the ysner-mistretl pairs failing to make a 
jump, hitting the ramp just behind and falling down to another 

level.  They picked themselves up and ran on, but they'd need to be 
very lucky to win now.  Lellius shook his head and used the flat end 
of a stylo to smooth a number off the wood-bordered wax tablet he 
held in his broad red hand. 

'You winning?' Leffid asked him. 

Lellius shook his head and looked sad. 

Leffid smiled, then made a show of inspecting the race track and the 
contending ysner-mistretl pairs. 'They don't look very festive to me,' 
he said. 'I expected something more… well, festive,' he concluded, 
lamely. 

'I believe the race authorities regard the Festival with the same 
misanthropic dubiety as I,' Lellius said. 'The festival is - what? -two 
days old?' 

Leffid nodded. 

'And already I am tired of it,' Lellius said, scratching behind one of 
his three ears with the wax tablet stylo. 'I thought of taking a holiday 
while it was occurring, but I am expected to be here, of course.  A 
month of challenging, ground-breaking art and ruthlessly enforced 
fun.' Lellius shook his head heavily. 'What a prospect.' 

Leffid put his chin in his cupped hand. 'You've never really been a 
natural for the AhForgetlt Tendency, have you, Lellius?' 

'I joined hoping it would make me more…' Lellius looked up 
contemplatively at the broad spread of the tree sculpture hanging 
above them. '… cavort-prone,' he said, and nodded. 'I wished to be 
more prone to cavorting and so I joined the Tendency hoping that the 
natural hedonism of people like your good self would somehow infect 
my own more deliberate, phlegmatic soul.' He sighed. 'I still live in 
hope.' 

Leffid laughed lightly, then looked slowly around. 'You here alone, 
Lellius?' 

Lellius looked thoughtful. 'My incomparably efficient Clerical Assistant 
Number Three visits the latrines, I believe,' he wheezed. 'My wastrel 
son is probably trying to invent new ways of embarεrassing me, my 
mate is half a galaxy away - very nearly enough - and my current 
darling stays at home, indisposed.  Or rather, disposed not to come 
to what she terms a boring bird-and-monkey race.' He nodded slowly. 
'I could reasonably be said to be alone, I suppose.  Why do you ask?' 

Leffid sat a little closer, arms on the carousel's small table. 'Saw 
something strange last night,' he said. 

'That young thing with the four arms?' Lellius asked, at least one eye 
twinkling. 'I did wonder if any other of her anatomical features were 
also doubled-up.' 

'Your prurience flatters me,' Leffid said. 'Ask her nicely and she will 
probably furnish you with a copy of a recording which proves both 
our relevant bits were quite singular.' 

Lellius chuckled and drank from a strawed flask. 'Not that, 
then.  What?' 

'Are we alone?' Leffid asked quietly. 

Lellius stared blankly at him for a moment. 'Yes; my lace is now 
turned off.  There is nothing else I know of watching or 
listening.  What is this thing you saw?' 

'I'll show you.' Leffid took a napkin from the table's slot and from a 
pocket in his shirt extracted the terminal he was using instead of the 
neural lace.  He looked at the markings on the instrument as though 
trying to remember something, then shrugged and said, 'Umm, 
terminal; become a pen, please.' 

Leffid wrote on the napkin, producing a sequence of seven pendant 
rhombi each composed of eight dots or tiny circles.  When he'd 
finished he turned the napkin towards Lellius, who looked carefully 
down at it and then equally deliberately up at Leffid. 

'Very pretty,' he wheezed. 'What is it?' 

Leffid smiled.  He tapped the rightmost symbol. 'First, it's an Elench 
signal because it's base eight and arranged in that pattern.  This first 
symbol is an emergency distress mark.  The other six are probably - 
almost certainly, by convention - a location.' 

'Really?' Lellius did not sound especially impressed. 'And the location 
of this location?' 

'About seventy-three years into the Upper Swirl from here.' 

'Oh,' Lellius said with a sort of rumbling noise that probably meant he 
was surprised. 'Just six digits to define such a preεcise point?' 

'Base two-five-six; easy,' Leffid said, shrugging his wings. 'But what's 
interesting is where I saw this signal.' 

'Mm-hmm?' Lellius said, momentarily distracted by something 
happening on the race track.  He took another drink then returned 
his attention to the other man. 

'It was on an Affronter light cruiser,' Leffid said quietly. 'Burned into 
its scar-hull.  Very lightly, very shallowly; at an angle across the 
blades-' 

'Blades?' Lellius asked. 

Leffid waved one hand. 'Decoration.  But it was there.  If I hadn't 
been very close to the ship - in a yacht - as it was approaching Tier 
I'd never have seen it.  And the intriguing possibility exists, of course, 
that the ship doesn't know it bears this message.' 

Lellius stared at the napkin for a moment.  He sat back. 'Hmm,' he 
said. 'Mind if I turn on my lace?' 

'Not at all,' Leffid said. 'I already know the ship's called the Furious 
Purpose and it's back here unscheduled, in Dock 807b.  If it's a 
mechanical problem it's got, I can't imagine it's anything to do 
directly with the scarring.  As for the location in the signal; it's about 
half way between the stars Cromphalet I/II and Esperi… slightly 

closer to Esperi.  And there's nothing there.  Nothing that anybody 
knows about, anyway.' 

Leffid 
tapped 
at 
the 
pocket 
terminal 
and 
after 
some 

experimenεtation got the beam to brighten until it ignited the napkin 
he'd written on.  He let it burn and was about to sweep the ashes into 
the table's disposal slot when Lellius - who was slumped back in the 
seat, looking blank - reached out one red hand and absently ground 
the ashes under his palm before scattering them to the breeze; they 
fell floating away from the carousel in an insubstantial cloud, towards 
the seats and private boxes stacked below. 

'Some minor running-gear problem,' Lellius said. 'The Affronter ship.' 
He was silent a moment longer. 'The Elench may have had a problem,' 
he said, nodding slowly. 'A clan-fleet - eight ships - left here a 
hundred days ago to investigate the Swirl.' 

'I remember,' Leffid said. 

'There have been,' Lellius paused, '… indications - barely even 
rumours - that not all has been right with them.' 

'Well,' Leffid said, placing his palms flat on the table and making to 
rise from his seat, 'it may be nothing, but I just thought I'd mention 
it.' 

'Kind,' Lellius wheezed, nodding. 'Not sure what the Tendency can do 
with it; last ship we had coming here went Sabbatical on us, 
ungrateful cur, but we might be able to trade it to the Mainland.' 

'Yes, the dear old Mainland,' Leffid said.  It was the term the 
AhForgetlt Tendency usually employed to refer to the Culture 
proper.  He smiled. 'Whatever.' He held his wings away from the seat-
back as he stood. 

'Sure you won't stay?' Lellius said, blinking. 'We could have a betting 
competition.  Bet you'd win.' 

'No thanks; this evening I'm playing host to a lady who needs two 
place settings at a time and I have to go polish my cutlery and make 
sure my flight feathers are fettled for ruffling.' 

'Ah.  Have armfuls of fun.' 

'I suspect I shall.' 

'Oh, damn,' Lellius said sadly, as a great shout went up from below 
and to most sides; the race was over. 

Lellius leant over and scratched out another couple of numbers on 
the wax tablet. 

'Never mind,' Leffid said, patting the vice-consul on his ample 
shoulder as he headed for the swaying cable bridge that would take 
him back to the main trunk of the huge artificial tree. 

'Yes,' Lellius sighed, looking at the smudge of ash on his hand. 'I'm 
sure there'll be another race starting in a while.' 

III 

The black bird Gravious flew slowly across the re-creation of the great 
sea battle of Octovelein, its shadow falling over the wreckage-dotted 
water, the sails and decks of the long wooden ships, the soldiers who 
stood massed on the decks of the larger vessels, the sailors who 
hauled at ropes and sheets, the rocketeers who struggled to rig and 
fire their charges, and the bodies floating in the water. 

A brilliant, blue-white sun glared from a violet sky.  The air was 
crisscrossed by the smoky trails of the primitive rockets and the sky 
seemed supported by the great columns of smoke rising from stricken 
warships and transports.  The water was dark blue, ruffled with 
waves, spattered with the tall feathery plumes of crashing rockets, 
creased white at the stem of each ship, and covered in flames where 
oils had been poured between ships in desperate attempts to prevent 
boarding. 

The bird flew over the edge of the sea scene, where the water ended 
like a still, liquid cliff and the unadorned floor of the general bay 
resumed, just five metres below, its surface also covered with what 
looked like wreckage - as though the tide had somehow gone out in 
this part of the bay but not the other - but which on closer inspection 
proved to be objects - parts of ships, parts of people - which had been 
in the process of construction.  The incomplete sea battle filled less 
than half of the bay's sixteen square kilometres.  This would have 
been 
the Sleeper 
Service's master-work, 
its 
definitive 

statement.  Now it might never be finished. 

The black bird flew on, passing a few of the ship's drones on the 
surface of the bay, gathering the construction debris and loading it 
onto an insubstantial conveyor belt which appeared to consist of a 
thin line of shady air.  It kept beating.  Its goal lay on the far end of 
the doubled general bay, between this internal section and the bay 
that opened to the rear of the ship.  Damn the woman for choosing 
to stay at the bows, nearest to where the tower had been.  Bad luck 
the place it had to be was so close to the stern. 

It had already flown through twenty-five kilometres of interior space, 
down the gigantic, dark internal corridor in the centre of the ship, 
between closed bay doors where a few dim lights glowed and utter 
silence reigned, a kilometre of air below its gently flapping wings, 
another above and one to each side. 

The bird had looked about it, taking in the huge, gloomy volεumes 
and supposing it ought to feel privileged; the ship had kept it out of 
these places for the last forty years, restricting it to the upper 
kilometre of its hull which housed the old accommodation areas and 
the majority of its Storees.  Gravious had senses beyond those 
normally available to an ordinary animal, and it had employed a 
couple of them in an attempt to probe the bay doors and find out 
what lay behind them, if anything.  As far as it could tell, the 
thousands of bays were empty. 

That had only taken it as far as the general bay engineering space, 
the biggest single volume in the ship with the divisions down; nine 
thousand metres deep, nearly twice that across and filled with noise 

and flickering lights and blurringly fast motion as the ship created 
thousands of new machines to do… who-knew-what. 

Most of the engineering space wasn't even filled with air; the material, 
components and machines could move faster that way.  Gravious was 
flying down a transparent traveltube set into the ceiling.  Nine 
kilometres of that took it to a wall which led into the relative serenity 
- or at least, stillness - of the sea battle tableau.  It was halfway 
across that now; just another four thousand metres to go.  Its wing 
muscles ached. 

It landed on the parapet of a balcony which looked out into the rear 
of this set of general bays.  Beyond were thirty-two cubic kilometres 
of empty air; a perfectly empty general bay, the sort of place where 
a normal GSV of this size would be building a smaller GSV, playing 
host to one which was visiting, housing an alien environment like a 
gigantic guests' room, turning over to some sports venue, or sub-
dividing into smaller storage or manufacturing spaces. 

Gravious looked back at the modest tableau on the balcony, which in 
its previous existence, before the GSV had decided to go Eccentric, 
had been part of a cafe with a fine view of the bay.  Here were posed 
seven humans, all with their backs to the view of the empty bay and 
facing the hologram of a calm, empty swimming pool.  The humans 
wore trunks; they sat in deck chairs around a couple of low tables full 
of drinks and snacks.  They had been caught in the acts of laughing, 
talking, blinking, scratching their chin, drinking. 

Some famous painting, apparently.  It didn't look very artistic to 
Gravious.  It supposed you had to see it from the right angle. 

It lifted one leg up from the parapet, and slipped, falling into the air 
of the general bay.  It hit something between it and the bay and fell, 
bouncing off the bay's rear wall, then off the invisible wall, then found 
its bearings, flapped close and parallel to the wall, twisted in the air 
when it got back to the level of the balcony, and returned to it. 

Uh-huh, it thought.  It risked using again the senses it was not 
supposed to have.  Solidity in the bay.  What it had hit was not glass, 
and not a field between it and the empty bay; the bay was not empty, 

and what it had hit was the field-edge of a projection.  On the far 
side, for at least two kilometres, there was solid matter.  Dense, solid 
matter.  Partially exotic dense solid matter. 

Well, there you were.  The bird shook itself and preened a little, 
combing its feathers smooth with its beak.  Then it looked around and 
half hopped, half flew over to one of the posed figures.  It inspected 
each one briefly, staring into an eye here, seemingly looking for a 
juicy parasite in an ear here, peering at a stray hair here and carefully 
studying a nostril here. 

It often did this, studying the next ones to go, the ones who would 
next be revived and taken away.  As though there was something to 
be learned from their carefully artificial postures. 

It pecked, in a desultory, barely interested sort of way at a stray hair 
in one man's armpit, then hopped away, studying the group from a 
variety of nearby tables and angles, trying to find the correct 
perspective from which to view the scene.  Soon to be gone, of 
course.  In fact, they were all going.  This lot with the rest, but this 
lot to re-awakening whereas most of them would just be Stored 
somewhere else.  But this lot, when they were woken in a few hours, 
would be coming back to life, somewhere.  Funny to think of it. 

Finally, the bird shook its head, stretched its wings, and hopped 
through the hologram and into the deserted cafe beyond, ready to 
begin the first leg of its journey back to its mistress. 

A few moments later, the avatar Amorphia stepped out of another 
part of the hologram, turned once to glance back at where the bird 
had hopped through the projection, then went and squatted before 
the figure of the man at whose armpit Gravious had pecked.

What was you? 

oo 

I was the go-between for the information transmitted from the 
AhForgetlt Tendency to SC.  One of our people on Tier saw the Affront 
light cruiser Furious Purpose as it arrived back there; it had a location 
in Elench code burned onto its scar-hull.  The information was 
transmitted from the Tendency mission on Tier to me; I passed it on 
to the Different Tan and the Steely Glint, my usual contacts in the 
Group/Gang.  I would guess the signal was then relayed to the 
GSV Ethics Gradient, home ship of the GCU Fate Amenable To 
Change, which subsequently discovered the Excession. 

So in a sense, this is all my fault.  I apologise. 

I had hoped this confession would never be necessary, but having 
turned this over in my mind I have concluded that - as was the case 
concerning the passing-on of the original information regarding the 
scar-hull signal in the first place - I had no choice.  Had you 
guessed?  Had you started to?  Do you still trust me? 

oo 

It had occurred to me, but I had no access to Tendency transmission 
records and was unwilling to ask the other Gang members directly.  I 
trust you no less for what you say.  Why are you telling me now? 

oo 

I would like to retain that trust.  Have you discovered anything else? 

oo 

Yes.  I think there is a link to a man called Genar-Hofoen, a Contact 
representative with the Affront on a habitat called God'shole, in the 

Fernblade.  He left there the day after the Excession was discovered; 
SC has hired three Affronter battle cruisers to take him to Tier.  They 
are due there in fourteen days.  His biography: (files attached).  You 
see the connection?  That ship again. 

You think it involved beyond what we believe we have agreed to 
already? 

oo 

Yes.  And the Grey Area. 

oo 

The times look a little unlikely; if it really pushed itself the GA can 
reach Tier in, what?… three days or so after this human gets 
there?  But that still leaves our other concern two months or more 
out of touch. 

oo 

I know.  Still, I think there is something going on.  I am following up 
all the avenues of investigation I can.  I'm making further inquiries 
through the more likely contacts mentioned in his file, but it's all 
going terribly slowly.  Thank you for your candour.  I shall remain in 
touch. 

oo 

You're welcome.  Do keep me informed.

And now it 'trusts you no less'.  ha! 

oo 

I remain convinced it was the right thing to do. 

oo 

Whatever; it is done.  What of the ship you asked to head for 
Pittance? 

oo 

On its way. 

oo 

And why Pittance? 

oo 

Is it not obvious?  Perhaps not.  Mayhap the paranoia of The 
Anticipation Of A New Lover's Arrival is contagious… However that 
may be, let me make my argument:  Pittance houses a veritable 
cornucopia of weaponry; indeed, the weapons deployed there just to 
protect the main cache of munitions - that is, the ships - alone 
represents a vast stockpile of potential destruction.  Certainly the 
store's course takes it nowhere near the Excession, but it has taken 
it into the general volume within which the Affront have some 
interest.  Now, while it has almost certainly gone unnoticed and even 
if it is spotted and tracked it can be of no interest'to the Affront (and, 
of course, it is anyway well able to defend itself), and it is not part of 
the subtle mobilisation being organised by the Steely Glint, it 
nevertheless represents the greatest concentration of matériel in the 
vicinity. 

I start to wonder; when, roughly, did the Culture start to have doubts 
- serious doubts - about the Affront?  And when was Pittance chosen 

as one of the ship stores?  Around the same time.  Indeed, Pittance 
was chosen, fitted out and stocked entirely within the time-scale of 
the debate which took place at the end of the Idiran War regarding 
military intervention against the Affront.  There are billions of bodies 
like Pittance; the galaxy is littered with such pieces of wreckage 
wandering between the stars.  Yet Pittance was chosen as one of only 
eleven such stores; a rock whose slow progress would take it into 
Affronter space within five or six centuries - depending on how fast 
the Affront expanded their sphere of influence - and which might well 
remain within that sphere for the foreseeable future, given that 
Affronter influence could easily push its borders out at a greater rate 
than that of a slowly tumbling rock moving at much less than a per 
cent of light speed.  How fortuitous to have such a wealth of 
weaponry embedded in Affront space! 

Might not this all, in fact, be a set-up? 

Think about this; is this not just the sort of thing you would be proud 
to have thought up?  Such foresight, such patience, such attention to 
the long game, such plausible protestations of innocence should the 
coincidence be remarked upon or revealed!  I know I'd be pleased 
with myself had I been part of such a plan. 

Lastly, on the committee of Minds which oversaw the choice of these 
stores, the names Woetra, Different Tan and Not Invented Here all 
sound rather familiar, think ye not? 

Taken all together, and even recognising that this is almost certainly 
a blind alley, I thought it irresponsible not to have a sharp eye 
attached to a sympathetic mind in the vicinity of that precious little 
rock. 

oo 

All right.  Point taken. 

oo 

And what of whatever you were working on? 

My original idea was to attempt to find someone acceptable on Tier 
who might be persuaded to our purpose; however, this proved 
impractical; there is considerable Contact and SC presence on the 
habitat but nobody I think we could risk sharing our appreεhensions 
with.  Instead, I have the tentative agreement of an old ally to 
support our cause should the occasion arise.  It is a month or more 
from Tier, and the Excession lies beyond there on its orientation, but 
it has access to a number of warships.  The tricky part is that some 
of them may be called up in the mobilisation, but a few may be put 
at our disposal.  Not as warships, I hasten to add, certainly not 
against other Culture ships, but as counters, as it were, or delivery 
systems, if and when we find a vulnerable point in the conspiracy we 
believe might exist. 

This Genar-Hofoen person; I may make my own inquiries in that 
direction, if I can avoid stepping on the metaphorical toes of our co-
concernee. 

The Affront angle is the one that worries me.  So aggressive!  Such 
drive!  For all our oft-repeated horror at their effects on others, there 
exists, I think, a kind of grudging admiration in many Culture folk for 
the Affront's energy, not to mention their apparent freedom from the 
effects of moral conscience.  Such an easy threat to see, and yet so 
difficult a problem to deal with.  I dread to think what awful plan 
might be hatched with a thoroughly clear conscience by perfectly 
estimable Minds to deal with such a perceived menace. 

Equally, given the qualitative scale of the opportunity which may be 
presented by the Excession, the Affront are just the sort of species - 
and at precisely the most likely stage in their development - to 
attempt some sort of mad undertaking which, however likely to fail, 
if it did succeed might offer rewards justifying the risk.  And who is 
to say they would be wrong in making such a judgement? 

oo 

Look, the damned Excession hasn't done anything yet.  All this 
nuisance has been caused by everybody's reaction to it.  Serve us all 

right if it turned out it is a projection of some sort, some God's 
jest.  I'm growing impatient, I don't mind telling you.  The Fate 
Amenable To Change stands off, watching the Excession doing 
nothing and reporting on it every now and again, various low-level 
Involveds are puffing themselves up and girding their scrawny loins 
with a view to taking a sight-seeing trip to the latest show in town 
and in the vague hope that if there is some sort of action they'll be 
able to pick up some of it, and all that the rest of us are doing is 
sitting around waiting for the big guns to arrive.  I wish something 
would happen! 

V 

'Good travelling with you, Genar-Hofoen,' Fivetide boomed.  They 
slapped limbs; the man had already braced one leg and the gelfield 
suit absorbed the actual impact, so he didn't fall over.  They were in 
the Entity Control area of the Level Eight docks, Affronter section, 
surrounded by Affronters, their slaved drones and other machines, a 
few members of other species who could tolerate the same conditions 
as the Affront, as well as numerous Tier sintricates - floating around 
like little dark balls of spines - all coming and going, leaving or joining 
travelators, spin cars, lifts and inter-section transport carriages. 

'Not staying for some rest and recreation?' Genar-Hofoen asked the 
Affronter.  Tier boasted a notoriously excellent Affront hunting 
reserve section. 

'Ha!  On the way back, perhaps,' Fivetide said. 'Duty calls elsewhere 
in the meantime.' He chuckled. 

Genar-Hofoen got the impression he was missing a joke here.  He 
wondered about this, then shrugged and laughed. 'Well, I'll see you 
back on God'shole, no doubt.' 

'Indeed!' Fivetide said. 'Enjoy yourself, human!' The Affronter turned 
on his tentacle tips and swept away, back to the battle-cruiser Kiss 
The Blade. Genar-Hofoen watched him go, and watched the lock 
doors close on the transit tunnel, with a frown on his face. 

~ What's worrying you? asked the suit. 

The man shook his head. ~ Ah, nothing, he said.  He stooped and 
picked up his hold-all. 

'Human male Byr Genar-Hofoen plus gelfield suit?' said a sintricate, 
floating up to him.  It looked, Genar-Hofoen thought, like an 
explosion in a sphere of black ink, frozen an instant after it began. 

He bowed briefly. 'Correct.' 

'I am to escort you to the Entity Control, human section.  Please 
follow me.' 

'Certainly.' 

They found a spin car, little more than a platform dotted with seats, 
stanchions and webbing.  Genar-Hofoen hopped on, followed by the 
sintricate, and the car accelerated smoothly into a transparent tunnel 
which ran out along the underside of the habitat's outer skin.  They 
were heading spinward, so that as the car gained speed they seemed 
to lose weight.  A field shimmered over the car, seeming to mould 
itself to the curved roof of the tunnel.  Gases hissed.  They went 
underneath the huge hanging bulk of one of the other Affronter ships, 
all blades and darkness.  He watched as it detached itself from the 
habitat, falling massively, silently away into space and the circling 
stars.  Another ship, then another and another dropped away after 
it.  They disappeared. 

~ What was the fourth ship? the man asked. 

~ The Comet class light cruiser Furious Purpose, the suit said. 

~ Hmm.  Wonder where they're off to. 

The suit didn't reply. 

It was getting misty in the car.  Genar Hofoen listened to gases hiss 
around him.  The temperature was rising, the atmosphere in the 
field-shrouded car changing from an Affronter atmosphere to a 
human atmosphere.  The car zoomed upwards for lower, less gravity 

intense levels, and Genar-Hofoen, used to Affronter gravity for these 
last two years, felt as though he was floating. 

~ How long before we rendezvous with the Meatfucker? he asked. 

~ Three days, the suit told him. 

~ Of course, they won't let you into the world proper, will they? the 
man said, as though realising this for the first time. 

~ No, said the suit. 

~ What'll you do while I'm off having fun? 

~ The same; I've already inquired ahead and come to an 
arrangement with a visiting Contact ship GP drone.  So I shall be in 
Thrall. 

It was Genar-Hofoen's turn not to say anything.  He found the whole 
idea of drone sex - even if it was entirely of the mind, with no physical 
component whatsoever - quite entirely bizarre!  Ah well, each to his 
own, he thought. 

Skin on skin; no suit, at last.  It was a good feeling.  He was dressed 
in a semi-formal outfit of loose pantaloons and long shirt, and 
enjoying the lushly sensual sensation of the glidingly smooth 
materials on his body. 

'Contact sent me to look after you,' Verlioef Schung said with a hint 
of ruefulness. 'I'm sure you don't need it, but I'm here if you do.  I, 

ah… I hope you don't mind.' Her voice… her voice was something to 
immerse yourself in. 

He smiled broadly and bowed. 'How could I?' he said. 

She laughed, putting one hand over her mouth - and, of course, her 
perfect teeth - as she did so. 'You're very kind.' She held out a hand. 
'May I take your bag?' 

'No, that's all right.' 

She raised her shoulders and let them drop. 'Well,' she said, 'you've 
missed the Festival, of course, but there's a whole gang of us who 
did, too, and we've sort of decided to have our own over the next few 
days and, well, frankly we need all the help we can get.  All I can 
promise you is luxurious accommodation, great company and more 
delectable preparations than you can shake a principle at, but if you 
care to make the sacrifice, I promise we'll all try to make it up to you.' 
She flexed her eyebrows and then made a mock-frightened 
expression, pulling down the corners of her succulently perfect 
mouth. 

He let her hold the look for a moment, then patted her on the upper 
arm. 'No, thank you,' he said sincerely. 

Her expression became one of hurt sadness. 'Oh… are you sure?' she 
said in a small, softly vulnerable voice. 

"Fraid so.  Made my own arrangements,' he said, with genuine but 
determined regret. 'But if there was anyone who was likely to tempt 
me away from them, it would be you.' He winked at her. 'I'm flattered 
by your generous offer, and do tell SC I appreciate the trouble they've 
gone to, but this is my chance to cut loose for a few days, you know?' 
He laughed. 'Don't worry; I'll have some fun and then I'll be ready to 
ship on out when the time comes.' He fished a small pen terminal out 
of one pocket and waved it in front of her face. 'And I'll keep my 
terminal with me at all times.  Promise.' He put the terminal back in 
his pocket. 

She gazed intently into his eyes for a few moments, then lowered her 
eyes and then her head and gave a small shrug.  She looked back up, 
expression ironic.  When she spoke, her voice had changed as well, 
modulating into something deeper and more considered, almost 
regretful. 'Well,' she sighed, 'I hope you enjoy yourself, Byr.' She 
grinned. 'Our offer stands, if you wish to reconsider.' Brave smile. 'My 
colleagues and I wish you well.' She looked furtively round the busy 
concourse and bit her bottom lip, frowning slightly. 'Don't suppose 
you fancy a drink or something anyway, do you?' she said, almost 
plaintively. 

He laughed, shook his head, and bowed as he backed off, hoisting his 
hold-all over his shoulder. 

All in all, entirely worth passing up the rather too obvious advances 
of his perfect woman for (well, no it wasn't… except it was when your 
perfect woman was almost certainly a Special Circumstances agent 
altered to look like the creature of your fantasies and sent to look 
after you, keep you happy and safe, when what you actually wanted 
was a bit of variety, some excitement and some un-Culture-like 
danger; his perfect partner certainly looked like the very splendid 
Verlioef Schung, but she was even more positively not SC, not 
Contact, and probably not even Culture either.  It was that desire for 
strangeness, for apartness, for alienness they probably couldn't 
understand). 

He lay in bed, pleasantly exhausted, the odd muscle quivering now 
and again of its own accord, surrounded by sleeping pulεchritude, 
his head buzzing with the after-effects of some serious glanding and 

watched the Tier news (Culture bias) channel on a screen hanging in 
the air in front of the nearest tree.  An ear-pip relayed the sound. 

Still leading with the Blitteringueh-Deluger saga.  Then came a 
feature on the increase in Fleeting in Culture ships.  Fleeting was 
when two or more ship Minds decided they were fed up being all by 
themselves and only being able to exchange the equivalent of letters; 
instead they got together, keeping physically close to each other so 
that they could converse.  Operationally most inefficient.  Some older 
Minds were worried it represented their more recently built comrades 
going soft and wanted the premise-states of Minds which would be 
constructed in the future to be altered to deal with this weak, overly 
chummy decadence. 

Local news; there was a brief follow-up report basically saying that 
the mysterious explosion which had happened in dock 807b on the 
third day of the Festival was still a mystery; the Affronter 
cruiser Furious Purpose had been lightly damaged by a small, pure 
energy detonation which had done nothing more than locally burn off 
a layer of its scar-hull.  An over-enthusiastic Festival prank was 
suspected. 

Not quite so locally, the arguments were still going on about the 
creation of a new Hintersphere a few kiloyears anti-spinward.  A 
Hintersphere was a volume of space in which FTL flights were banned 
except in the direst of emergencies, and life generally moved at a 
slower pace than elsewhere in the Culture.  Genar-Hofoen shook his 
head at that one.  Pretentious rusticism. 

Nearer home again, back-up craft were only a day away from the 
location of the possible anomaly near Esperi.  The discovering GCU 
was still reporting no change in the artifact.  Despite requests from 
Contact section, various other Involved civilisations had sent or were 
sending ships to the general volume, but Tier itself had forgone 
dispatching a craft.  To the surprise of most observers, the Affront 
had criticised the reaction of those who had decided to be nosy and 
had stayed severely away from the anomaly, though there were 
unconfirmed reports of increased Affront activity in the Upper Leaf 
Swirl, and just today four ships- 

'Off,' Genar-Hofoen said quietly, and the screen duly vanished.  One 
of the erotroupe stirred against him.  He looked at her. 

The girl's face was the very image of that belonging to Zreyn Tramow, 
one-time captain of the good ship Problem Child. Her body was 
different from the original, altered in the direction of Genar-Hofoen's 
tastes, but subtly.  There were two like her and three who looked 
exactly like famous personalities - an actress, a musician and a 
lifestyler.  Zreyn and Enhoff, Shpel, Py and Gidinley.  They had all 
been 
perfectly 
charming as 
well 
as 
being 
quite 
plausible 

impersonators, but Genar-Hofoen thought you had to wonder at the 
mentality of people who actually chose to alter their appearance and 
behaviour every few days just to suit the tastes - usually though not 
always sexual - of others.  But maybe he was just being a bit fuddy-
duddyish.  Perhaps they were slightly boring people otherwise, or 
perhaps they just liked a deal more variety in such matters than other 
people. 

Whatever their motivations, all five had fallen politely asleep on the 
AG bed after the fun, which had been preceded by a meal and a 
party.  The troupe's Exemplary Couple, Gakic and Leleeril were 
asleep too, lying in each other's arms on the carpet-like lawn between 
the bed platform and the stream which threaded its way from the 
tinkling waterfall and the pool.  Detumesced, the man's prick was 
almost normal looking.  Genar-Hofoen felt slightly sleepy himself, but 
he was determined to stay awake for the whole holiday; he brushed 
the sleepiness back under the edges of his mind with a glandular 
release of gain. Doing this for three days solid would leave him 
needing lots of sleep, but there would be a week on the Grey 
Area/Meat 
fucker; plenty 
of 
time 
to 
recover.  The 
buzz of 

gain coursed through him, clearing his head and ridding his body of 
the effects of fatigue.  Gradually a feeling of rested, ready 
peacefulness washed over and through him. 

He clasped his hands behind his neck and gazed happily upwards past 
the fronds of a couple of overhanging trees at the blue, cloud-strewn 
sky.  Just that movement, performed in the gravity of Tier's 
standard-G level, gave him a good, light, almost childishly enjoyable 
sensation.  Affronter standard gravity was more than twice the 

Culture-promoted human norm, and he supposed it was a sign of how 
well and how easily his body had adapted to conditions on God'shole 
habitat that he had quickly and long since stopped noticing how much 
heavier he had felt from day to day. 

A thought occurred to him.  He closed his eyes briefly, going quickly 
into the semi-trance that the average Culture adult employed, when 
they needed to and could be bothered, to check on their physiological 
settings.  He dug around inside various images of his body until he 
saw himself standing on a small sphere.  The sphere was set at one 
standard gravity; his subconscious had registered the fact that he 
had been in a steady, reduced gravity field for longer than a few hours 
and had re-set itself.  Left to its own devices, his body would now 
start to lose bone and muscle mass, thin the walls of his blood vessels 
and perform a hundred other tiny but consequential alterations the 
better to suit his frame, tissues and organs to that reduced severity 
of weight.  Well, his subconscious was only doing its job, and it didn't 
know he would be back in Affronter gravity again in a month or 
so.  He increased the size of the sphere his image stood upon until it 
was back to the two point one gravities his body would have to 
readjust itself to once he returned to God'shole.  There, that should 
do it.  He cast a quick look round his internal states while he was 
here, not that there ought to be anything amiss; warning signs made 
themselves obvious automatically.  Sure enough, all was well; fatigue 
being dealt with, presence of gain noted, blood sugar returning to 
normal, hormones generally being gathered back to optimum levels. 

He came out of the semi-trance, opened his eyes and looked over at 
where the pen terminal lay on a sculpted, smoothly varnished tree 
stump at the bedside.  So far he had mostly used it to check up on 
the replies from his Contact contacts, confirming what they could 
concerning this - so far - pleasantly undemanding mission.  The 
terminal was supposed to blink a little light if it had a message stored 
for him.  He was still waiting to hear from the GSV Not Invented Here, 
the Incident Coordinator for the Excession.  The terminal lay where 
he'd left it, dull.  No new messages.  Oh well. 

He looked away and watched the clouds move in the sky for a while, 
then wondered what it looked like turned off. 

'Sky, off,' he said, keeping his voice low. 

The sky disappeared and the true ceiling of the penthouse suite was 
revealed; a slickly black surface studded with projectors, lights and 
miscellaneous bumps and indentations.  The few gentle animal 
sounds faded away.  In the View Hotel, every suite was a penthouse 
corner suite; there were four per floor, and the only floor which didn't 
have four penthouse suites was the very top one, which, so that 
nobody in the lower floors would feel they were missing out on the 
real thing when it was available, was restricted to housing some of 
the hotel's machinery and equipment.  Genar-Hofoen's was called a 
jungle suite, though it was entirely the most manicured, pest-free 
and temperately, temperature-controlled and generally civilised 
jungle he had ever heard of. 

'Night sky, on,' he said quietly.  The slick black ceiling was replaced 
by blackness scattered with sharply bright stars.  Some animal noises 
resumed, sounding different compared to those heard in the 
daylight.  They were real animals, not recordings; every now and 
again a bird would fly across the clearing where the bed was situated, 
or a fish would splash in the bathing pool or a chattering simian would 
swing across the forest canopy or a huge, glittering insect would burr 
delicately through the air. 

It was all terribly tasteful and immaculate, and Genar-Hofoen was 
already starting to look forward to the evening, when he intended to 
dress in his best clothes and hit the town, which in this case was Night 
City, located one level almost straight down, where, traditionally, 
anything on Tier that could breathe a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere 
and tolerate one standard gravity - and had any sort of taste for 
diversion and excitement - tended to congregate. 

A night in Night City would be just the thing to complete this first mad 
rush of fun at the onset of his short holiday.  Calling ahead and 
ordering up a fabulously expensive erotroupe to act out his every 
sexual fantasy was one thing - one extremely wonderful and deeply 
satisfying thing, beyond all doubt, he told himself with all due 
solemnity - but the idea of a chance meeting with somebody else, 
another free, independent soul with their own desires and demands, 
their own reservations and requirements; that, just because it was 

all up to chance and up to negotiation, just because it all might end 
in nothing, in rejection, in the failure to impress and connect, in being 
found wanting rather than being wanted, that was a more valuable 
thing, that was an enterprise well worthy of the risk of rebuff. 

He glanded charge. That ought to do it. 

Seconds later, filled to bursting with the love of action, moveεment 
and the blessed need to be doing something, he was bouncing out of 
bed, laughing to himself and apologising to the sleepily grumbling but 
still palatably comely cast of the erotroupe. 

He skipped to the warm waterfall and stood under it.  As he showered 
he told a blue-furred, wise-looking little creature dressed in a dapper 
waistcoat and sitting on a nearby tree what clothes he wished 
prepared for the evening.  It nodded and swung off through the 
branches. 

VI 

'It's nothing to worry about, Gestra,' the drone told him as he stepped 
out of the bulky suit in the vestibule beyond the airlocks.  Gestra 
Ishmethit leant against a maniple field which the drone extended for 
him.  He looked down the corridor to the main part of the 
accommodation unit, but there was no sign of anybody yet. 'The ship 
has come with new codes and updated security procedures,' the 
drone continued. 'It's some years before these were due to be 
altered, but there has been some unusual activity in a nearby volume 
- nothing threatening as such, but it's always best to be careful - so 
it's been decided to move things along a bit and perform the update 
now rather than later.' The drone hung the man's suit up near the 
airlock doors, its surface sparkling with frost. 

Gestra rubbed his hands together and accepted the trousers and 
jacket the drone handed him.  He kept glancing down the corridor. 

'The ship has been verified and authenticated by the necessary 
outside referees,' the drone told him, 'so it's all above-board, you 
see?' The machine helped him button up the jacket and smoothed his 

thin, fair hair. 'The crew have asked to come inside; just curious, 
really.' 

Gestra stared at the drone, obviously distressed, but the machine 
patted him on the shoulder with a rosy field and said, 'It'll be all right, 
Gestra.  I thought it only polite to grant their request, but you can 
stay out of their way if you like.  Saying hello to them at first would 
probably go down well, but it isn't compulsory.' The Mind had its 
drone study the man for a moment, checking his breathing, heart 
rate, pupil dilation, skin response, pheromone output and brain-
waves. 'I know what,' it said soothingly, 'we'll tell them you've taken 
a vow of silence, how's that?  You can greet them formally, nod, or 
whatever, and I'll do the talking.  Would that be all right?' 

Gestra gulped and said, 'Y-y-yes!  Yes,' he said, nodding vigεorously. 
'That… that would be good… good idea.  Tha-thank you!' 

'Right,' the machine said floating at the man's side as they headed 
down the corridor for the main reception area. 'They'll Displace over 
in a few minutes.  Like I say; just nod to them and let me say 
whatever has to be said.  I'll make your excuses and you can go off 
to your suite if you like; I'm sure they won't mind being shown round 
by this drone.  Meanwhile I'll be receiving the new ciphers and 
routines.  There's a lot of multiple-checking and bureaucratic book-
keeping sort of stuff to be done, but even so it should only take an 
hour or so.  We won't offer them a meal or anything; with any luck 
they'll take the hint and head off again, leave us in peace, eh?' 

After a moment, Gestra nodded at this, vigorously.  The drone 
swivelled in the air at the man's side to show him it was looking at 
him. 'Does all this sound acceptable?  I mean, I could put them off 
completely; tell them they're just not welcome, but it would be 
terribly rude, don't you think?' 

'Y-yes,' Gestra said, frowning and looking distinctly uncertain. 
'Rude.  Suppose so.  Rude.  Mustn't be rude.  Probably come a long 
way, should think?' A smile flickered around his lips, like a small flame 
in a high wind. 

Gestra was smiling a little more confidently as he walked into the 
accommodation unit's main reception area. 

The reception area was a large round room full of couches and 
chairs.  Gestra usually paid it no attention; it was just a largish space 
he had to walk through on his way to and back from the airlocks which 
led to the warship hangars.  Now he looked at each of the plumply 
comfortable-looking seats and sofas as though they represented 
some terrible threat.  He felt his nervousness return.  He wiped his 
brow as the drone stopped by a couch and indicated he might like to 
sit. 

'Let's have a look, shall we?' the drone said as Gestra sat.  A screen 
appeared in the air on the far side of the room, starting as a bright 
dot, quickly widening to a line eight metres long then seeming to 
unroll so that it filled the four-metre space between floor and ceiling. 

Blackness; little lights.  Space.  Gestra realised suddenly how long it 
had been since he'd seen such a view.  Then, sweeping slowly into 
view came a long, dark grey shape, sleek, symmetrical, double-
ended, reminding Gestra of the axle and hubs of a ship's windlass. 

'The Killer class Limited Offensive Unit Attitude Adjuster,' the drone 
said in a matter-of-fact, almost bored-sounding voice. 'Not a type we 
have here.' 

Gestra nodded. 'No,' he said, then stopped to clear his throat a few 
times. 'No pattern… patterns on it… its hull.' 

'That's right,' the drone said. 

The ship was stopped now, almost filling the screen.  The stars 
wheeled slowly behind it. 

'Well, I-' the drone said, then stopped.  The screen on the far side of 
the room flickered. 

The drone's aura field flicked off.  It fell out of the air, bouncing off 
the seat beside Gestra and toppling heavily, lifelessly, to the floor. 

Gestra stared at it.  A voice like a sigh said, '… sssave yourssselfff…' 
then the lights dimmed, there was a buzzing noise from all around 
Gestra, and a tiny tendril of smoke leaked out of the top of the drone's 
casing. 

Gestra leapt up out of the seat, staring wildly around, then jumped 
up on the seat, crouching there and staring at the drone.  The little 
wisp 
of 
smoke 
was 
dissipating.  The 
buzzing 
noise 
faded 

slowly.  Gestra squatted, hugging his knees with both arms and 
looking all about.  The buzzing noise stopped; the screen collapsed 
to a line hanging in the air, then shrank to a dot, then winked 
out.  After a moment, Gestra reached forward with one hand and 
prodded the drone's casing with one hand.  It felt warm and solid.  It 
didn't move. 

A sequence of thuds from the far side of the room shook the 
air.  Beyond where the screen had hung in the air, four tiny mirror 
spheres bloated suddenly, growing almost instantly to over three 
metres in diameter and hovering just above the floor.  Gestra jumped 
off the seat and started back away from the spheres.  He rubbed his 
hands together and glanced back at the corridor to the airlock.  The 
mirror spheres vanished like exploding balloons to reveal complicated 
things like tiny space-ships, not much smaller than the mirror spheres 
themselves. 

One of them rushed towards Gestra, who turned and ran. 

He pelted down the corridor, running as fast as he could, his eyes 
wide, his face distorted with fear, his fists pumping. 

Something rushed up behind him, crashed into him and knocked him 
over, sending him sprawling and tumbling along the carpeted 
floor.  He came to a stop.  His face hurt where it had grazed along 
the carpet.  He looked up, his heart twitching madly in his chest, his 
whole body shaking.  Two of the miniature ship things had followed 
him into the corridor; each floated a couple of metres away, one on 
either side of him.  There was a strange smell in the air.  Frost had 

formed on various parts of the ship things.  The nearer one extended 
a thing like a long hose and went to take him by the neck.  Gestra 
ducked down and doubled himself up, lying on his side on the carpet, 
face tucked into his knees, arms hugging his shins. 

Something prodded him about the shoulders and rump.  He could 
hear muffled noises coming from the two machines.  He whimpered. 

Then something very hard slammed into his side; he heard a cracking 
noise and his arm burned with pain.  He screamed, still trying to bury 
his face in his knees.  He felt his bowels relax.  Warmth flooded his 
pants.  He was aware of something inside his head turning off the 
searing pain in his arm, but nothing could turn off the heat of shame 
and embarrassment.  Tears filled his eyes. 

There was a noise like, 'Ka!' then a whooshing noise, and a breeze 
touched his face and hands.  After a moment he looked up and saw 
that the two machines had gone down to the airlock doors.  There 
was movement in the reception area, and then another one of the 
machines came down the corridor; it slowed down as it approached 
him.  He ducked his head down again.  Another whoosh and another 
breeze. 

He looked up again.  The three machines were moving around near 
the airlock doors.  Gestra sniffed back his tears.  The three machines 
drew 
back 
from 
the 
doors, 
then 
settled 
down 
onto 
the 

ground.  Gestra waited to see what would happen next. 

There was a flash, and an explosion.  The middle set of doors blew 
out in a burst of smoke that rolled up the corridor and then collapsed 
backwards, seemingly sucking the whole explosion back into where 
the doors had been.  The doors had gone, leaving a dark hole. 

A breeze tugged at Gestra, then the breeze turned to a wind and the 
wind became a storm that howled and then screamed past him and 
then started moving him bodily along the floor.  He shouted in fear, 
trying to grab hold of the carpet with his one good arm; he slid down 
the corridor in the roar of air, his fingers scrabbling for a grip.  His 
nails dug in, found purchase, and his fingers closed around the fibres, 
pulling him to a stop. 

He heard thuds and looked up, gasping, towards the reception area, 
eyes streaming with tears as the wind whipped by him.  Something 
moved, bouncing in the lighted doorway of the circular lounge.  He 
saw the vague, rounded shape of a couch thudding into the floor 
twenty metres away and flying towards him on the howling stream of 
air.  He heard himself shout something.  The couch thudded into the 
floor ten metres away, tumbling end over end. 

He thought it was going to miss him, but one end of it smashed into 
his dangling feet, tearing him away; the storm of air picked him up 
bodily and he screamed as he fell with it past the shapes of the three 
watching machines.  One of his legs hit the jagged edges of the 
breach in the airlock doors and was torn off at the knee.  He flew out 
into the huge space beyond, the air pulled from his mouth first by his 
scream and then by the vacuum of the hangar itself. 

He skidded to a stop on the cold hard floor of the hangar fifty metres 
from the wrecked doors, blood oozing then freezing around his 
wounds.  The cold and the utter silence closed in; he felt his lungs 
collapse and something bubbled in his throat; his head ached as if his 
brain were about to burst out of his nose, eyes and ears, and his 
every tissue and bone seemed to ring with brief, stunning pain before 
going numb. 

He looked into the enveloping darkness and up at the towering, 
heedless heights of the bizarrely patterned ships. 

Then the ice crystals forming in his eyes fractured the view and made 
it splinter and multiply as though seen through a prism, before it all 
went dim and then black.  He was trying to shout, to cry out, but 
there was only a terrible choking coldness in his throat.  In a moment, 
he couldn't even move, frozen there on the floor of the vast space, 
immobile in his fear and confusion. 

The cold killed him, finally, shutting off his brain in concentric stages, 
freezing the higher functions first, then the lower mammal brain, then 
finally the primitive, near-reptilian centre.  His last thoughts were 
that he would never see his model sea ships again, nor know why the 
warships in the cold, dark halls were patterned so. 

there.  Gangster class.  His gaze swept their ranks.  Sixty-four of 
them.  He had, privately, thought it might all be a hoax, some Culture 
trick. 

At his side, his weapons officer steered his suit across the floor - over 
the body of the human - and up towards the nearest of the ships.  The 
other suited figure, the Affronter Commander's personal guard, 
rotated, watching. 

'If you'd waited another minute,' the voice of the Culture ship said 
tiredly through the suit's communicator, 'I could have opened the 
airlock doors for you.' 

'I'm sure you could,' the Commander said. 'Is the Mind quite under 
your control?' 

'Entirely.  Touchingly naive, in the end.' 

'And the ships?' 

'Quiescent; undisturbed; asleep.  They will believe whatever they are 
told.' 

'Good,' the Commander said. 'Begin the process of waking them.' 

'It is already under way.' 

'Nobody 
else 
here,' 
his 
security 
officer 
said 
over 
the 

communiεcator.  He had gone on into the rest of the human 
accommodation section when they had made their way to the airlock 
doors. 

'Anything of interest?' the Commander asked, following his weapons 
officer towards the nearest warship.  He had to try to keep the 
excitement out of his voice.  They had them!  They had them!  He 

had to brake the suit hard; in his enthusiasm he almost collided with 
his weapons officer. 

In the ruined suite that had been the place where the human had 
lived, the security officer swivelled in the vacuum, surveying the 
wreckage the evacuating whirlwind of air had left.  Human coverings; 
clothes, items of furniture, some complicated structures; models of 
some sort. 'No,' he said. 'Nothing of interest.' 

'Hmm,' the ship said.  Something about the tone communicated 
unease to the Commander.  At the same moment, his weapons officer 
turned his suit to him. 'Sir,' he said.  A light flicked on, picking out a 
metre-diameter circle of the ship's hull.  Its surface was riotously 
embellished and marked, covered in strange, sweeping designs.  The 
weapons officer swept the light over nearby sections of the vessel's 
curved hull.  It was all the same, all of it covered with these curious, 
whorled patterns and motifs. 

'What?' the Commander said, concerned now. 

'This… complexity,' the weapons officer said, sounding perεplexed. 

'Internal, too,' the Culture ship broke iri. 

'It…' the weapons officer said, spluttering.  His suit moved closer to 
the warship's hull, until it was almost touching. 'This will take for ever 
to scan!' he said. 'It goes down to the atomic level!' 

'What does?' the Commander said sharply. 

'The ships have been baroqued, to use the technical term,' the 
Culture ship said urbanely. 'It was always a possibility.' It made a 
sighing noise.  The vessels have been fractally inscribed with partially 
random, non-predictable designs using up a little less than one per 
cent of the mass of each craft.  There is a chance that hidden in 
amongst that complexity will be independent security nano-devices 
which will activate at the same time as each ship's main systems and 
which will require some additional coded reassurance that all is well, 
otherwise they will attempt to disable or even destroy the 
ship.  These will have to be looked for.  As your weapons officer says, 

the craft will each have to be scanned at least down to the level of 
individual atoms.  I shall begin this task the instant I have completed 
the reprogramming of the base's Mind.  This will delay us, that's all; 
the ships would have required scanning in any event, and in the 
meantime, nobody knows we're here.  You will have your war fleet in 
a matter of days rather than hours, Commander, but you will have 
it.' 

The 
weapons 
officer's 
space 
suit 
turned 
to 
face 
the 

Commanεder's.  The light illuminating the outlandish designs 
switched off.  Somehow, from the way he performed these actions, 
the weapons officer conveyed a mood of scepticism and perhaps even 
disgust to the Commander. 

'Ka!' the Commander said contemptuously, whirling away and 
heading back towards the airlock doors.  He needed to wreck 
something.  The accommodation section ought to provide articles 
which would be satisfying but unimportant.  His personal guard swept 
after him, weapons ready. 

Passing over the still, frozen body of the human - even that hadn't 
provided any sport - Commander Risingmoon Parchseason IV of the 
Farsight tribe and the battleship Xenoclast - on secondεment to the 
alien ship Attitude Adjuster - unholstered one of the external 
weapons on his own suit and blasted the small figure into a thousand 
pieces, scattering fragments of frosty pink and white across the cold 
floor of the hangar like a small, delicate fall of snow. 

7. Tier 

I 

Such investigations took time.  There was the time that even 
hyperspacially 
transmitted 
information took 
to traverse 
the 

sigεnificant percentages of the galaxy involved, there were 
complicated routes to arrange, other Minds to talk to, sometimes 
after setting up appointments because they were absent in Infinite 
Fun space for a while.  Then the Minds had to be casualed up to, or 
gossip or jokes or thoughts on a mutual interest had to be exchanged 

before a request or a suggestion was put which re-routed and 
disguised an information search; sometimes these re-routes took on 
extra loops, detours and shuntings as the Minds concerned thought 
to play down their own involvement or involve somebody else on a 
whim, so that often wildly indirect paths resulted, branching and re-
branching and doubling back on themselves until eventually the 
relevant question was asked and the answer, assuming it was 
forthcoming, started the equally tortuous route back to the original 
requester.  Frequently simple seeker-agent programs or entire mind-
state abstracts were sent off on even more complicated missions with 
detailed instructions on what to look for, where to find it, who to ask 
and how to keep their tracks covered. 

Mostly it was done like that; through Minds, AI core memories and 
innumerable public storage systems, information reservoirs and 
databases containing schedules, itineraries, lists, plans, cataεlogues, 
registers, rosters and agenda. 

Sometimes, though, when that way - the relatively easy, quick and 
simple way - was closed to the inquirer for some reason, usually to 
do with keeping the inquiry secret, things had to be done the slow 
way, the messy way, the physical way.  Sometimes there was no 
alternative. 

The sea beneath the airship was mostly black-dark, but in places it 
glowed dimly in giant, slowly fading Vs as giant sea creatures 

surfaced to breathe or to sieve new levels of the waters for their tiny 
prey, and so disturbed the light-emitting plankton near the surface. 

The island floated high in the breeze-ruffled waters, its base a steeply 
fluted pillar that extended a kilometre down into the sea's salty 
depths, its thin, spire-like mountains thrusting a similar distance into 
the cloudless air.  It too was scattered with lights; of small towns, 
villages, individual houses, lanterns on beaches and smaller aircraft, 
most of them come out to welcome the vacuum dirigible. 

The two slowly revolving gondola sections slid gradually to a halt, 
preparatory to docking.  People in both segments congregated on the 
sides nearest the island, for the view.  The airship's system registered 
the imbalance building up and pumped bubblecarbon spheres full of 
vacuum from one lot of tanks to another, so maintaining a suitably 
even keel. 

The island's main town drifted slowly closer, the docking tower bright 
with lights.  Lasers, fireworks and searchlights all fought for 
attention. 

'I really should go, Tish,' the drone Gruda Aplam said. 'I didn't 
promise, but I did kind of say I'd probably stop by…' 

'Ah, stop by on the way back,' Tishlin said, waving his glass. 'Let them 
wait.' 

He stood on the balcony outside one of the lower gondola's mid-level 
bars.  The drone - a very old thing, like two grey-brown rounded 
cubes one on top of the other and three-quarters the size of a human 
- floated beside him.  They'd only met that day, four days into the 
cruise over the Orbital's floating islands and they'd got on famously, 
quite as though they'd been friends for a century or more.  The drone 
was much older than the man but they found they had the same 
attitudes, the same beliefs and the same sense of humour.  They both 
liked telling stories, too.  Tishlin had the impression he hadn't yet 
scratched the veneer off the old machine's tales of when it had been 
in Contact - a millennium before he had, and goodness knew he was 
considered an old codger these days. 

He liked the ancient machine; he'd really come on this cruise looking 
for romance, and he still hoped to find it, but in the meantime finding 
such a perfect companion and raconteur had already made him glad 
he'd come.  The trouble was the drone was supposed to get off here 
and go to visit some old drone pals who lived on the island, before 
resuming its cruise on the next dirigible, due in a few days' time.  A 
month from now, it would be leaving on the GSV that had brought it 
here. 

'But I feel I'd be letting them down.' 

'Look, just stay another day,' the man suggested. 'You never did 
finish telling me about - what was it, Bhughredi?' 

'Yes, Bhughredi.' The old drone chuckled. 

'Exactly.  Bhughredi; the sea nukes and the interference effect thing 
or whatever it was.' 

'Damnedest way to launch a ship,' the old drone agreed, and made a 
sighing noise. 

'So what did happen?' 

'Like I said, it's a long story.' 

'So stay tomorrow; tell me it.  You're a drone for goodness' sake; you 
can float back by yourself…' 

'But I said I'd visit them when the airship got here, Tish.  Anyway; 
my AG units are due a service; they'd probably fail and I'd end up at 
the bottom of the sea having to be rescued; very embarrassing.' 

'Take a flyer back!' the man said, watching the island's shore slide 
underneath.  People gathered round fires on the beach waved up at 
the craft.  He could hear music drifting on the warm breeze. 

'Oh, I don't know… They'd probably be upset.' 

Tishlin drank from his glass and frowned down at the waves breaking 
on the beach which led towards the lights of the town.  A particularly 

large and vivid firework detonated in the air directly above the bright 
docking tower.  Oos and Aahs duly sounded round the crowded 
balcony. 

The man snapped his fingers. 'I know,' he said. 'Send a mind-state 
abstract.' 

The big drone hesitated, then said, 'Oh, one of those.  Hmm.  Well; 
still not really the same thing, I think.  Anyway, I've never done 
one.  Not sure I really approve.  I mean, it's you but it's not you, you 
know?' 

Tishlin nodded. 'Certainly do know.  Can't say I think they're as, you 
know, benign as they're cracked up to be either; I mean, it's 
supposed 
to act sentient 
without being sentient, 
so 
isn't 

it actually sentient?  What happens to it when it's just turned 
off?  I'm not convinced there isn't some sort of iffy morality here, 
either.  But I've done it myself.  Talked into it.  Reservations, like you 
say, but…' He looked round, then leant closer to the machine's dull 
brown casing. 'Bit of a Contact thing, actually.' 

'Really?' the old machine said, tipping its whole body away from him 
for a moment, then tipping it back so that it leant towards him.  It 
extended a field round the two of them; the exterior sounds 
faded.  When it spoke again, it was with a slight echo that indicated 
the field was keeping whatever they said between the two of them. 
'What was that… Well, wait a moment, if you aren't supposed to tell 
anybody…' 

Tishlin weaved his hand. 'Well, not officially,' he said, brushing white 
hair over one ear, 'but you're a Contact veteran, and you know how 
SC always dramatises things.' 

'SC!' the drone said its voice rising. 'You didn't say it was them!  I'm 
not sure I want to hear this,' it said, through a chuckle. 

'Well, they asked… a favour,' the man said, quietly pleased that he 
seemed finally to have impressed the old drone. 'Sort of a family 
thing.  Had to record one of these damn things so it could go and 
convince a nephew of mine he should do his bit for the great and 

good cause.  Last I heard the boy had done the decent thing and 
taken ship for some Eccentric GSV.' He watched the outskirts of the 
town slide underneath.  A flower-garlanded terrace held groups of 
people pattern-dancing; he could imagine the whoops and wild, 
whirling music.  The scent of roasting meat came curling over the 
balcony parapet and made it through the hushfield. 

'They asked if I wanted it to be reincorporated after it had done its 
job,' he told the drone. 'They said it could be sent back and sort of 
put back inside my head, but I said no.  Gave me a creepy feeling 
just thinking about it.  What if it had changed a lot while it was 
away?  Why, I might end up wanting to join some retreatist order or 
autoeuthenise or someεthing!' He shook his head and drained his 
glass. 'No; I said no.  Hope the damn thing never was really alive, 
but if it was, or is, then it's not getting back into my head, no thank 
you, I'm sorry.' 

'Well, if what they told you was true, it's yours to do with as you wish, 
isn't it?' 

'Exactly.' 

'Well, I don't think I'll take the same step,' the drone said, sounding 
thoughtful.  It swivelled as though to face him.  The field around 
them collapsed.  The sound of the fireworks returned. 'Tell you what,' 
the old drone said. 'I will get off here and see the guys, but I'll catch 
up with you in a couple of days, all right?  We'll probably fall out in a 
day or two anyway; they're cantankerous old buggers, frankly.  I'll 
take a flyer or try floating myself if I feel adventurous.  Deal?' It 
extended a field. 

'Deal,' Tishlin said, slapping the field with his hand. 

Tsikiliepre, which in turn contacted the Ulterior Entity Highpoint, 
which signalled the LSV Misophist, which passed the message on to 
the University Mind at Oara, on Khasli plate in the Juboal system, 
which duly relayed the signal, along with an interesting series of 
rhyme-scheme glyphs, ordinary poems and word games all based on 
the original signal, to its favoured protege, the LSV Serious Callers

A Plate class General Systems Vehicle was quite a simple thing, in at 
least one way.  It was four kilometres thick; the lowest kilometre was 
almost all engine, the middle two klicks were ship space - an entire 
enclosed system of sophisticated dockyards and quays, in effect - and 
the topmost thousand metres was accommodation, most of it for 
humans.  There was, of course, a great deal more to it than that, but 
this covered the essentials. 

Using these broad-brush figures, it was a simple matter for anybody 
to work out the craft's approximate maximum speed from the cubic 
kilometrage of its engines, the number of ships of any given size it 
could contain according to the volume given over to the various sizes 
of bays and engineering space, and the total number of humans it 
could accommodate by simply adding up how many cubic kilometres 
were given over to their living-space. 

The Sleeper Service had retained an almost pristine original 
specification internally, which was a rare thing in an Eccentric vessel; 
usually the first thing they did was drastically reconfigure their 
physical shape and internal lay-out according to the dictates of some 
private aesthetic, driving obsession or just plain whim, but the fact 
the Sleeper Service had stuck to its initial design and merely added 
its own private ocean and gas-giant environment on the outside made 
it relatively easy to measure its actual behaviour against what it 
ought to be capable of, and so ensure that it wasn't up to any extra 
mischief besides being Eccentric in the first place. 

In addition to such simple, arithmetical estimates of a ship's 
capability, it was, of course, always a good idea when dealing with an 
Eccentric 
craft 
to 
have 
just 
that 
little 
extra 
bit 
of 
an 

edge.  Intelligence, to be specific; an inside view; a spy. 

As 
it 
approached 
the 
Dreve 
system, 
the 
Plate 
class 

GSV Sleeper Service was travelling at its usual cruising speed of 
about forty kilolights.  It had already announced its desire to stop off 
in the inner system, and so duly started braking as it passed through 
the orbit of the system's outer-most planet, a light week distant from 
the sun itself. 

The Yawning Angel, the GSV which was shadowing the larger craft, 
decelerated 
at 
the 
same 
rate, 
a 
few 
billion 
kilometres 

behind.  The Yawning Angel was the latest in a long line of GSVs 
which had agreed to take a shift as the Sleeper Service's escort.  It 
wasn't a particularly demanding task (indeed, no sensible GSV would 
wish it to be), though there was a small amount of vicarious glamour 
associated with it; guarding the weirdo, letting it roam wherever it 
wanted, but maintaining the fraternal vigilance that such an 
enormously powerful craft espousing such an eccentric credo patently 
merited.  The only qualifications for being a Sleeper Service shadow 
were that one was regarded as being reliable, and that one was 
capable of staying with the SS if it ever decided to make a dash for 
it; in other words, one had to be quicker than it. 

The Yawning Angel had done the job for the best part of a year and 
found it undemanding.  Naturally, it was somewhat annoying not to 
be able to draw up one's own course schedule, but providing one took 

the right attitude and dispensed with the standard Mind conviction 
that held efficiency to the absolute bottom line of everything, it could 
be an oddly enhancing, even liberating experience.  GSVs were 
always wanted in many more places at the same time than it was 
possible to be, and it was something of a relief to be able to blame 
somebody else when one had to frustrate people's and other ships' 
wishes and requests. 

This stop at Dreve had not been anticipated, for example - the SS's 
course had seemed set on a reasonably predictable path which would 
take it through the next month - but now it was here, the Yawning 
Angel would be able to drop off a few ships, take another couple on, 
and swap some personnel.  There should be time; the SS had never 
acknowledged the presence of any of the vessels tailing it, and it 
hadn't posted a course schedule since it had turned Eccentric forty 
years earlier, but it had certain obligations in terms of setting re-
awakened people back in the land of the living again, and it always 
announced how long it would be staying in the systems it visited. 

It would be here in Dreve for a week.  An unusually long time; it had 
never stayed anywhere for longer than three days before.  The 
implication, according to the group of ships considered experts on the 
behaviour of the Sleeper Service, and given what the GSV itself had 
been saying in its increasingly rare communications, was that it was 
about to off-load all its charges; all the Storees and all the big sea, 
air and gas-giant-dwelling creatures it had collected over the decades 
would be moved - physically, presumably, rather than Displaced - to 
compatible habitats. 

Dreve would be an ideal system to do this in; it had been a Culture 
system for four thousand years, comprising nine more or less 
wilderness worlds and three Orbitals - hoops, giant bracelets of living-
space only a few thousand kilometres across but ten million 
kilometres in diameter - calmly gyrating in their own carefully aligned 
orbits and housing nearly seventy billion souls.  Some of those souls 
were far from human; one third of each of the system's Orbitals was 
given over to ecosystems designed for quite different creatures; gas-
giant dwellers on one, methane atmospherians on another and high 
temperature silicon creatures on another.  The fauna the SS had 

picked up from other gas-giant planets would all fit comfortably into 
a sub-section of the Orbital designed with such animals in mind, and 
the sea and air creatures ought to be able to find homes on that or 
either of the other worlds. 

A week to hang around; the Yawning Angel thought that would go 
down particularly well with its human crew; one of the many tiny but 
significant and painful ways a GSV could lose face amongst its peers 
was through a higher than average crew turn-over rate, and, while it 
had been expecting it, the Yawning Angel had found the experience 
most distressing when people had announced they were fed up not 
being able to have any reliable advance notice of where they were 
going from week to week and month to month and so had decided to 
live elsewhere; all its protestations had been to no avail.  What would 
in effect be a week's leave in such a cosmopolitan, sophisticated and 
welcoming system really should convince a whole load of those 
currently wavering between loyalty and ship-jumping that it was 
worth staying on with the good old Yawning Angel, it was sure. 

The Sleeper Service came to an orbit-relative stop a quarter-turn in 
advance along the path of the middle Orbital, the most efficient 
position to assume to distribute its cargo of people and animals 
evenly amongst all three worlds.  Permission to do so was finally 
received from the last of the Orbitals' Hub Minds, and the Sleeper 
Service duly began getting ready to unload. 

The Yawning Angel watched from afar as the larger craft detached its 
traction fields from the energy grid beneath real space, closed down 
its primary and ahead scan fields, dropped its curtain shields and 
generally made the many great and small adjustments a ship 
normally made when one was intending to stick around somewhere 
for a while.  The Sleeper Service's external appearance remained the 
same as ever; a silvery ellipsoid ninety kilometres long, sixty across 
the beam and twenty in height.  After a few minutes, however, 
smaller craft began to appear from that reflective barrier, speeding 
towards the three Orbitals with their cargoes of Stored people and 
sedated animals. 

All this matched with the intelligence the Yawning Angel had already 
received regarding the set-up and intentions of the Eccentric 
GSV.  So far so good, then. 

Content that all was well, the Yawning Angel drifted in to match 
velocities with Teriocre, the middle Orbital and the one with the gas-
giant environments.  It docked underneath the Orbital's most 
populous section and drew up a variety of travel and leave 
arrangeεments for its own inhabitants while setting up a schedule of 
visits, events and parties aboard to thank its hosts for their 
hospitality. 

Everything went swimmingly until the second day. 

Then, without warning, just after dawn had broken over the part of 
the Orbital the yawning Angel had docked beneath, Stored bodies 
and giant animals started popping into existence all over Teriocre. 

Posed people, some still in the clothes or uniforms of the tableaux 
they had been part of on board the Sleeper Service, suddenly 
appeared inside sports halls, on beaches, terraces, boardwalks and 
pavements, in parks, plazas, deserted stadia and every other sort of 
public space the Orbital had to offer.  To the few people who 
witnessed these events, it was obvious the bodies had been 
Displaced; the appearance of each was signalled by a tiny point of 
light blinking into existence just above waist level; this expanded 
rapidly to a two-metre grey sphere which promptly popped and 
disappeared, leaving behind the immobile Storee. 

Unmoving people were left lying on dewy grass or sitting on park 
benches or scattered by the hundred across the patterned mosaic of 
squares and piazzas as though after some terrible disaster or a 
particularly assertive public sculpture exhibition; dim cleaning 
machines spiralling methodically within such spaces were left 
bemused, picking erratic courses amongst the rash of new and 
unexpected obstructions. 

In the seas, the surface swelled and bulged in hundreds of different 
places as whole globes of water were carefully Displaced just beneath 
the surface; the sea creatures contained within were still gently 

sedated and moved sluggishly in their giant fish bowls, each of which 
retained its separation from the surrounding water for a few hours, 
osmosing fields gradually adjusting the conditions within to those in 
the sea outside. 

In the air, similar gauzy fields surrounded whole flocks of buoyant 
atmosphere fauna, bobbing groggily in the breeze. 

Further along the vast shallow sweep of the Orbital, the gas-giant 
environments were witness to equivalent scenes of near-instant 
immigration followed by gradual integration. 

The Yawning Angel's own drones - its ambassadors on the Orbital - 
were witness to a handful of these sudden manifestations.  After a 
nanosecond's delay to ask permission, the GSV clicked into the 
Orbital's own monitoring systems, and so watched with growing 
horror as hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands more Stored bodies 
and animals came thumping into existence all over the surface and 
all through the air, water and gas-ecologies of Teriocre. 

The Yawning Angel flash-woke all its systems and switched its 
attention to the Sleeper Service. 

The big GSV was already moving, rolling and twisting to point directly 
upwards out of the system.  Its engine fields reconnected with the 
energy grid, its scanners were all already back on line and the rest of 
its multi-layered field complex was rapidly configuring itself for 
sustained deep-space travel. 

It moved off, not especially quickly.  Its Displacers had switched 
to pick rather than put now; in a matter of seconds they had snapped 
almost its entire fleet of smaller ships out of the system, their genuine 
yet deceptive delivery missions completed.  Only the furthest, most 
massive vessels were left behind. 

The Yawning 
Angel was 
already 
frantically 
making 
its 
own 

preparations to depart in pursuit, closing off most of its transit 
corridors, snap-Displacing drones from the Orbital, hurrying through 
a permission-to-depart request to the world's Hub and drawing up 
schedules for ferrying people back to the Orbital on smaller craft once 

it had got under way while at the same time bringing other personnel 
back before its own velocity grew too great. 

It knew it was wasting its energy, but it signalled the Sleeper 
Service anyway.  Meanwhile, it watched intently as the departing ship 
accelerated away. 

The Yawning Angel was gauging, judging, calibrating. 

It was looking for a figure, comparing an aspect of the reality that 
was the absconding craft with the abstraction that was a simple but 
crucial equation.  If the Sleeper Service's velocity could at any point 
over time be described by a value greater than .54 x ns2, the Yawning 
Angel might be in trouble. 

It might be in trouble anyway, but if the larger vessel was 
accelεerating significantly quicker than its normal design parameters 
implied - allowing for the extra mass of the craft's extraneous 
environments - then that trouble started right now. 

As it was, the Yawning Angel was relieved to see, the Sleeper 
Service was moving away at exactly that rate; the ship was still 
perfectly apprehendable, and even if the Yawning Angel waited for 
another day without doing anything it would still be able to track the 
larger craft with ease and catch up with it within two days.  Still 
suspecting some sort of trick, the Yawning Angel started an 
observation 
routine 
throughout 
the 
system 
for 
unexpected 

Displacings of gigatonnes of water and gas-giant atmosphere; 
suddenly dumping all that extra volume and mass now would be one 
way the Sleeper Service could put on an extra burst of speed, even if 
it would still be significantly slower than the Yawning Angel. 

The smaller GSV retransmitted its polite but insistent signal.  Still no 
reply from the Sleeper Service. No surprise there then. 

The Yawning Angel signalled to tell other Contact craft what was 
happening and sent one of its fastest ships - a Cliff class superlifter 
stationed in space outside the GSV's own fields for exactly this sort 
of eventuality - in pursuit of the escaping GSV, just so it would know 
this precocious, irksome action was being taken seriously. 

Probably the Sleeper Service was simply being awkward rather than 
up to something more momentous, but the Yawning Angel couldn't 
ignore the fact the larger craft was abandoning a signifiεcant 
proportion of its smaller ships, and had resorted to Displacing people 
and animals.  Displacing was - especially at such speed - inherently 
and unfinessably dangerous; the risk of something going horribly, 
terminally wrong was only about one in eighty million for any single 
Displacement event, but that was still enough to put the average, 
fussily perfectionist ship Mind off using the process for anything alive 
except in the direst of emergencies, and the Sleeper Service 
- assuming it had rid itself of its entire complement of souls - must 
have carried out thirty-thousand plus Displacements in a minute or 
less, nudging the odds up well into the sort of likelihood-of-fuck-up 
range any sane Mind would normally recoil from in utter horror.  Even 
allowing for the Sleeper Service's Eccentricity, that did tend to 
indicate that there was something more than usually urgent or 
significant about its current actions. 

The Yawning Angel looked up what was in effect an annoyance chart; 
it could leave right now - within a hundred seconds - and aggravate 
lots of people because they were on board itself instead of the Orbital, 
or vice-versa… or it could depart within twenty hours and leave 
everybody back where they ought to be, even if they were irritated 
at their plans being upset. 

Compromise; it set an eight-hour departure time.  Terminals in the 
shape of rings, pens, earrings, brooches, articles of clothing - and the 
in-built versions, neural laces - woke startled Culture personnel all 
over the Orbital and the wider system, insisting on relaying their 
urgent message.  So much for keeping everybody happy with a 
week's leave… 

The Sleeper Service accelerated smoothly away into the darkness, 
already well clear of the system.  It began to Induct, flittering 
between inferior and superior hyperspace.  Its apparent real-space 
velocity jumped almost instantly by a factor of exactly twenty-
three.  Again, the Yawning Angel was comforted to see, spot on.  No 
unpleasant surprises.  The superlifter Charitable View raced after the 
fleeing craft, its engines unstressed, energy expenditure throttled 

well back, also threading its way between the layers of four-
dimensional space.  The process had been compared to a flying fish 
zipping from water to air and back again, except that every second 
air-jump was into a layer of air beneath the water, not above it, which 
was where the analogy did rather break down. 

The Yawning Angel was quickly customising thousands of carefully 
composed, exquisitely phrased apologies to its personnel and 
hosts.  Its schedule of ship returns, varied to reflect the different 
courses the Sleeper Service might take if it didn't remain on its 
present heading, didn't look too problematic; it had delayed letting 
people venture far away until the Sleeper Service had sent most of 
its own fleet out, an action even it had thought over-cautious at the 
time but which now seemed almost prescient.  It delegated part of its 
intellectual resources to drawing up a list of treats and blandishments 
with which to mollify its own people when they returned, and planned 
for a two-week return to Dreve, packed with festivities and 
celebrations, to say sorry when it was free of the obligation to follow 
this accursed machine and was able to draw up its own course 
schedule again. 

The Charitable View reported that the Sleeper Service was still 
proceeding as could be expected. 

The situation, it appeared, was in hand. 

The Yawning Angel reviewed its own actions so far, and found them 
exemplary.  This was all very vexing, but it was responding well, 
playing it by the book where possible and extemporising sensibly but 
with all due urgency where it had to.  Good, good.  It could well come 
out of this shining. 

Three hours, twenty-six minutes and seventeen seconds after setting 
off, the General Systems Vehicle Sleeper Service reached its nominal 
Terminal Acceleration Point.  This was where it ought to stop gaining 
speed, plump for one of the two hyperspatial volumes and just cruise 
along at a nice steady velocity. 

It didn't.  Instead it accelerated harder; that .54 figure zoomed 
quickly to .72, the Plate class's normal design maximum. 

The Charitable View communicated this turn of events back to 
the Yawning Angel, which went into shock for about a millisecond. 

It rechecked all its in-system ships, drones, sensors and external 
reports.  There was no sign that the Sleeper Service had dumped its 
extra mass anywhere within range of the Yawning Angel's sensors. 

Yet it was behaving as though it had.  Where had it done it?  Could it 
have secretly built longer-range Displacers? (No; half its mass would 
have been required to construct a Displacer capable of dumping so 
much volume beyond the range of the Yawning Angel's sensors, and 
that included all the extra mass it had taken on board over the years 
in the form of the extraneous environments in the first place… though 
- now that it was thinking in such outrageous terms - there was 
another, associated possibility that just might… but no; that couldn't 
be.  There had been no intelligence, no hint… no, it didn't even want 
to think about that…) 

The Yawning Angel rescheduled everything it had already arranged in 
a flurry of re-drafted apologies, pleas for understandεing and 
truncated journeys.  It halved the departure warning time it had 
given.  Thirty-three minutes to departure, now.  The situation, it tried 
to explain to everybody, was becoming more urgent. 

The Sleeper Service's acceleration figures remained steady at their 
design maxima for another twenty minutes, though the Charitable 
View - keeping a careful watch on every aspect of the GSV's 
performance from its station a few real-space light days behind - 
reported 
some 
odd 
events 
at 
the 
junctions 
of 

the Sleeper Service's traction fields with the energy grid. 

By now the Yawning Angel was existing in a state of quiveringly 
ghastly tension; it was thinking at maximum capacity, worrying at 
full speed, suddenly and appallingly aware how long things took to 
happen; a human in the same state would have been clutching a 
churning stomach, tearing their hair out and gibbering incoherently. 

Look at these humans!  How could such glacial slowness even be 
called life? An age could pass, virtual empires rise and fall in the time 
they took to open their mouths to utter some new inanity! 

Ships, even ships; they were restricted to speeds below the speed of 
sound in the bubble of air around the ship and the docks it was joined 
to.  It reviewed how practicable it would be to just let the air go and 
move everything in vacuum.  It made sense.  Thankfully, it had 
already shifted all vulnerable pleasure craft out of the way and sealed 
and secured its unconnected hull apertures.  It told the Hub what it 
was doing; the Hub objected because it was losing some 
of its air.  The GSV dumped the air anyway.  Everything started 
moving a little faster.  The Hub screamed in protest but it ignored it. 

Calm; calm; it had to remain calm.  Stay focused, keep the most 
important objectives in mind. 

A wave of what would have been nausea in a human swept through 
the Yawning Angel's Mind as a signal came in from the Charitable 
View. Now what? 

Whatever it might have feared, this was worse. 

The Sleeper 
Service's acceleration 
factor 
had 
started 
to 

increase.  Almost at the same time, it had exceeded its normal 
maximum sustainable velocity. 

Fascinated, appalled, terrified, the Yawning Angel listened to a 
running commentary on the other GSV's progress from its 
increasingly distant child, even as it started the sequence of actions 
and 
commands 
that 
would 
lead 
to 
its 
own 
near-instant 

departure.  Twelve minutes early, but that couldn't be helped, and if 
people were pissed off, too bad. 

Still increasing.  Time to go.  Disconnect.  There. 

The Charitable View signalled that the Sleeper Service's outerεmost 
field extent had shrunk to within a kilometre of naked-hull minima. 

The Yawning Angel dropped away from the orbital, twistεing and 
aiming and punching away into hyperspace only a few kilometres 
away from the world's undersurface, ignoring incandescent howls of 
protest from the Hub over such impoεlite and feasibly dangerous 
behaviour and the astonished - but slow, so slow - yelps from people 

who an instant earlier had been walking down a transit corridor 
towards a welcoming foyer in the GSV and now found themselves 
bumping into emergency seal-fields and staring at nothing but 
blackness and stars. 

The 
superlifter's 
continuous 
report 
went 
on: 
the Sleeper 

Service's acceleration kept on increasing slowly but steadily, then it 
paused, 
dropping 
to 
zero; 
the 
craft's 
velocity 
remained 

constant.  Could that be it?  It was still catchable.  Panic over? 

Then the fleeing ship's velocity increased again; as did its rate of 
acceleration. Impossible! 

The horrific thought which had briefly crossed the Yawning 
Angel's mind moments earlier settled down to stay with all the 
gruesome deliberation of a self-invited house guest. 

It did the arithmetic. 

Take a Plate class GSV's locomotive power output per cubic kilometre 
of engine.  Add on sixteen cubic klicks of extra drive at that push-
per-cube value… make that thirty-two at a time… and it matched the 
step 
in 
the Sleeper 
Service's acceleration 
it 
had 
just 

witnessed.  General bays.  Great grief, it had filled its General bays 
with engine. 

The Charitable View reported another smooth increase in the Sleeper 
Service's rate of progress leading to another step, another pause.  It 
was increasing its own acceleration to match. 

The Yawning Angel sped after the two of them, already fearing the 
worst.  Do the sums, do the sums.  The Sleeper Service had filled at 
least four of its General bays with extra engine, bringing-them on line 
two at a time, balancing the additional impetus… 

Another increase. 

Six.  Probably all eight, then.  What about the engineering space 
behind?  Had that gone too? 

Sums, sums.  How much mass had there been aboard the damn 
thing?  Water; gas-giant atmosphere, highly pressurised.  About four 
thousand 
cubic 
kilometres 
of 
water 
alone; 
four 

gigatonnes.  Compress it, alter it, transmute it, convert it into the 
ultra dense exotic materials that comprised an engine capable of 
reaching out and down to the energy grid that underlay the universe 
and pushing against it… ample, ample, more than enough.  It would 
take months, even years to build that sort of extra engine capacity… 
or only days, if you'd spent, say, the last few decades preparing the 
ground. 

Dear holy shit, if it was all engine even the superlifter wouldn't be 
able to keep up with it.  The average Plate class could sustain about 
one hundred and four kilolights more or less indefinitely; a good 
Range class, which was what the Yawning Angel had always been 
proud to count itself as, could easily beat that by forty kilolights.  A 
Cliff class superlifter was ninety per cent engine; faster even than a 
Rapid Offensive Unit in short bursts.  The Charitable View could hit 
two-twenty-one flat out, but that was only supposed to be for an hour 
or two at a time; that was chase speed, catch-up speed, not 
something it could maintain for long. 

The figure the Yawning Angel was looking at was the thick end of two-
thirty-three, if the Sleeper Service's engineering space had been 
packed with engine too. 

The Charitable View's tone had already turned from one of 
amusement to amazement, then bewilderment.  Now it was plain 
peevish.  The Sleeper Service was topping the two-fifteen mark and 
showing no signs of slowing down.  The superlifter would have to 
break away within minutes if it didn't top-out soon.  It asked for 
instructions. 

The Yawning Angel, still accelerating for all its worth, deterεmined 
to track and follow for as long as it could or until it was asked to give 
up the chase, told its offspring craft not to exceed its design 
parameters, not to risk damage. 

The Sleeper 
Service went 
on 
accelerating.  The 

superlifter Chariεtable View gave up the chase at two-twenty.  It 

settled back to a less frenetic two hundred, dropping back all the 
time; even so it was still not a speed it could maintain for more than 
a few hours. 

The Yawning Angel topped out at one forty-six. 

The Sleeper Service finally hit cruise at around two-thirty-three and 
a half, disappearing ahead into the depths of galactic space.  The 
superlifter reported this but sounded like it couldn't believe it. 

The Yawning Angel watched the other GSV race away into the 
everlasting night between the stars, a sense of hopelessness, of 
defeat, settled over it. 

Now 
it knew it 
had 
shaken 
off 
its 
pursuers the Sleeper 

Serεvice's course was starting to curve gently, no doubt the first of 
many ducks and weaves it would carry out, if it was trying to conceal 
its eventual goal, and assuming that it had a goal other than simply 
giving 
the 
slip 
to 
its 
minders… 
Someεhow, 
the Yawning 

Angel suspected its Eccentric charge - or ex-charge - did have a 
definite goal; a place, a location it was headed for. 

Two hundred and thirty-three thousand times the speed of 
light.  Dear holy fucking shit.  The Yawning Angel thought there was 
something almost vulgar about such a velocity.  Where the hell was 
it heading for? Andromeda? 

The Yawning Angel drew a course-probability cone through the 
galactic model it kept in its mind. 

It supposed it all depended how devious the Sleeper Service was 
being, but it looked like it might be headed for the Upper Leaf 
Swirl.  If it was, it would be there within three weeks. 

The Yawning Angel signalled ahead.  Look on the bright side; at least 
the problem was out of its fields now. 

The avatar Amorphia stood - arms crossed, thin, black-gloved hands 
grasping at bony elbows - gaze fastened intently upon the screen on 
the far side of the lounge.  It showed a compensated view of 
hyperspace, vastly magnified. 

Looking into the screen was like peering into some vast planetary 
airscape.  Far below was a layer of glowing mist representing the 
energy grid; above was an identical layer of bright cloud.  The skein 
of real space lay in between both of these; a two-dimensional layer, 
a simple transparent plane which the GSV went flickering through like 
a weaving shuttle across an infinite loom.  Far, far behind it, the tiny 
dot that was the superlifter shrank still further.  It too had been 
bobbing up and down through the skein on a sine wave whose length 
was measured in light minutes, but now it had stopped oscillating, 
settling into the lower level of hyperspace. 

The magnification jumped; the superlifter was a larger dot now, but 
still dropping back all the time.  A light-point tracing its own once 
wavy now straight course even further behind was the pursuing 
GSV.  The star of the Dreve system was a bright spot back beyond 
that, stationary in the skein. 

The Sleeper Service reached its maximum velocity and also ceased 
to oscillate between the two regions of hyperspace, settling into the 
larger of the two infinities that was ultraspace.  The two following 
ships did the same, increasing their speed fractionally but briefly.  A 
purist would call the place where they now existed ultraspace one 
positive, though as nobody had ever had access to ultraspace one 
negative - or infraspace one positive, for that matter - it was a 
redundant, even pedantic distinction.  Or it had been until now.  That 
might be about to change, if the Excession could deliver what it 
appeared to promise… Amorphia took a deep breath and then let it 
go. 

The view clicked off and the screen disappeared. 

The avatar turned to look at the woman Dajeil Gelian and the black 
bird Gravious.  They were in a recreation area on the Ridge class 
GCU Jaundiced Outlook, housed in a bay in one of the Sleeper 
Service's mid-top strakes.  The lounge was pretty well standard 

Contact 
issue; 
deceptively 
spacious, 
stylishly 
comfortable, 

punctuated by plants and subdued lighting. 

This ship was to be the woman's home for the rest of the journey; a 
life boat ready to quit the larger craft at a moment's notice and take 
her to safety if anything went wrong.  She sat on a white recliner 
chair, dressed in a long red dress, calm but wide-eyed, one hand 
cupped upon her swollen belly, the black bird perched on one arm of 
the seat near her hand. 

The avatar smiled down at the woman. 'There,' it said.  It made a 
show of looking around. 'Alone at last.' It laughed lightly, then looked 
down at the black bird, its smile disappearing. 'Whereas you,' it said, 
'will not be again.' 

Gravious jerked upright, neck stretching. 'What?' it asked.  Gelian 
looked surprised, then concerned. 

Amorphia glanced to one side.  A small device like a stubby pen 
floated out of the shadows cast by a small tree.  It coasted up to the 
bird, which shrank back and back from the small, silent missile until 
it almost fell off the arm of the chair, its blue-black beak centimetres 
from the nose cone of the tiny, intricate machine. 

'This is a scout missile, bird,' Amorphia told it. 'Do not be deceived by 
its innocent title.  If you so much as think of committing another act 
of treachery, it will happily reduce you to hot gas.  It is going to follow 
you everywhere.  Don't do as I have done; do as I say and don't try 
to shake it off; there is a tracer nanotech on you - in you - which will 
make it a simple matter to follow you.  It should be correctly 
embedded by now, replacing the original tissue.' 

'What?' the bird screeched again, head jerking up and back. 

'If you want to remove it,' Amorphia continued smoothly, 'you may, 
of course.  You'll find it in your heart; primary aorεtic valve.' 

The bird made a screaming noise and thrashed vertically into the 
air.  Dajeil flinched, covering her face with her hands.  Gravious 
wheeled in the air and beat hard for the nearest corridor.  Amorphia 

watched it go from beneath cold, lid-hooded eyes.  Dajeil put both 
her hands on her abdomen.  She swallowed.  Something black drifted 
down past her face and she picked it out of the air.  A feather. 

'Sorry about that,' Amorphia said. 

'What… what was all that about?' Gelian asked. 

Amorphia shrugged. 'The bird is a spy,' it said flatly. 'Has been from 
the first.  It got its reports to the outside by encoding them on a 
bacterium and depositing them on the bodies of people about to be 
returned for re-awakening.  I knew about it twenty years ago but let 
it pass after checking each signal; it was never allowed to know 
anything the disclosure of which could pose a threat.  Its last 
message was the only one I ever altered.  It helped facilitate our 
escape from the attentions of the Yawning Angel.' Amorphia grinned, 
almost childishly. 'There's nothing further it can do; I set the scout 
missile on it to punish it, really.  If it distresses you, I'll call it off.' 

Dajeil Gelian looked up into the steady grey eyes of the cadaverous, 
dark-clad creature for some time, quite as if she hadn't even heard 
the question. 

'Amorphia,' she said. 'Please; what is going on?  What is really going 
on?' 

The ship's avatar looked pained for a moment.  It looked away, 
towards the plant the scout missile had been hiding underneath. 
'Whatever else,' it said awkwardly, formally, 'always remember that 
you are free to leave me at any time; this GCU is entirely at your 
disposal and no order or request of mine will affect its actions.' It 
looked back at her.  It shook its head, but its voice sounded kinder 
when it spoke again; 'I'm sorry, Gelian; I still can't tell you very 
much.  We are going to a place near a star called Esperi.' The creature 
hesitated, as though unsure, gaze roaming the floor and the nearby 
seats. 'Because I want to,' it said eventually, as though only realising 
this itself for the first time. 'Because there may be something I can 
do there.' It raised its arms out from its body, let them fall again. 
'And in the meantime, we await a guest.  Or at any rate, I await a 
guest.  You may not care to.' 

'Who?' the woman asked. 

'Haven't you guessed?' the avatar said softly. 'Byr Genar-Hofoen.' 

The woman looked down then, and her brows slowly creased, and the 
dark feather she had caught fell from her fingers.

Yes.  Two three three.  What's it doing - going for some kind of 
record?  Yes yes yes all right you were correct about the human.  But 
why didn't you have any warning of this? 

oo 

I don't know.  Two decades of reliable but totally boring reports and 
then just when it might have been handy to know what the big bugger 
was really up to, the intelligence conduit caves in.  All I can think of 
is that our mutual friend… oh, hell, might as well call it by its real 
name now I suppose… is that the Sleeper Service discovered the link 
- we don't know when - and waited until it had something to hide 
before it started messing with our intelligence. 

oo 

Yes, but what's it doing? We thought it was Just being invited to join 
the Group out of politeness, didn't we?  Suddenly it's acting like a 
fucking missile.  What is it up to? 

oo 

This may seem rather obvious, but we could always just ask it. 

Tried that.  Still waiting. 

Well you could have said… 

oo 

I beg your pardon.  So now what?

Now I get a load of bullshit from the Steely Glint. Excuse me.

No it isn't!  I'm getting fed up repeating this; I should have posted a 
general notice.  No; we wanted the damn thing's views, some sort of 
entirely outside viewpoint, not it tearing off to anywhere near the 
Excession itself. 

It was part of the Gang before, you know.  We owed it that, no matter 
that it is now Eccentric.  Would that we had known how much… 

Now we've got another horrendous variable screwing up our plans. 

If you have any helpful suggestions I'd be pleased to hear them.  If 
all you can do is make snide insinuations then it would probably 

benefit all concerned if you bestowed the fruits of your prodigious wit 
on someone with the spare time to give them the consideration they 
doubtless deserve.

(signal file attached) What did I tell you?  I don't know about 
this.  Looks suspicious to me.

Hmm.  And I don't know, either.  I hate to say it, but it sounds

If, after all this is over, we are both still in a position for me to confer

IV 

Genar-Hofoen didn't take his pen terminal with him when he went out 
that evening, and the first place he visited in Night City was a Tier-
Sintricate/Ishlorsinami Tech. store. 

The woman was small for an Ishy, thought Genar-Hofoen.  Still, she 
towered over him.  She wore the usual long black robes and she 
smelled… musty.  They sat on plain, narrow seats in a bubble of 
blackness.  The woman was bent over a tiny fold-away screen 
balanced on her knees.  She nodded and craned her body over 
towards him.  Her hand extended, close to his left ear.  A sequence 
of shining, telescoping rods extended from her fingers.  She closed 
her eyes.  In the dimness, Genar-Hofoen could see tiny lights 
flickering on the inside of her eyelids. 

Her hand touched his ear, tickling slightly.  He felt his face twitch. 
'Don't move,' she said. 

He tried to stay still.  The woman withdrew her hand.  She opened 
her eyes and peered at the point where the tips of three of the 
delicate rods met.  She nodded and said, 'Hmm.' 

Genar-Hofoen bent forward and looked too.  He couldn't see 
anything.  The woman closed her eyes again; her lid screens glowed 
again. 

'Very sophisticated,' she said. 'Could have missed it.' 

Genar-Hofoen looked at his right palm. 'Sure there's nothing on this 
hand?' he asked, recalling Verlioef Schung's firm handshake. 

'As sure as I can be,' the woman said, withdrawing a small 
transparent container from her robe and dropping whatever she had 
taken out of his ear into it.  He still couldn't see anyεthing there. 

'And the suit?' he asked, fingering one lapel of his jacket. 

'Clean,' the woman said. 

'So that's it?' he asked. 

'That is all,' she told him.  The black bubble disappeared and they 
were sitting in a small room whose walls were lined with shelves 
overflowing with impenetrably technical-looking gear. 

'Well, thanks.' 

'That will be eight hundred Tier-sintricate-hour equivalents.' 

'Oh, call it a round thousand.' 

Night City Tier was situated on the middle level of the world, on a 
small island in a shallow sea.  The island was entirely covered by a 
shallow dome ten kilometres across and two in height.  Internally, 
the City tended to take its cue from each year's Festival.  The last 
time Genar-Hofoen had been here the place had taken on the 
appearance of a magnified oceanscape, all its buildings turned into 
waves between one and two hundred metres tall.  The theme that 
year had been the Sea; Street Six had existed in the long trough 
between two exponentially swept surges.  Ripples on the towering 
curves of the waves' surfaces had been balconies, burning with 
lights.  Luminous foam at each wave's looming, overhanging crest 
had cast a pallid, sepulchral light over the winding street beneath.  At 
either end of the Street the broadway had risen to meet crisscrossing 
wave fronts and connect - through oceanically inauthentic tunnels - 
with other highways. 

The theme this year was the Primitive and the City had chosen to 
interpret this as a gigantic early electronic circuit board; the network 
of silvery streets formed an almost perfectly flat cityscape studded 
with enormous resistors, dense-looking, centipedally legged flat-
topped chips, spindly diodes and huge semi-transparent valves with 
complicated internal structures, each standing on groups of shining 
metal legs embedded in the network of the printed circuit.  Those 
were the bits that Genar-Hofoen sort of half recognised from his 
History of Technical Stuff course or whatever it had been called when 
he'd been a student; there were lots of other jagged, knobbly, 

smooth, brightly coloured, matt black, shiny, vaned, crinkled bits he 
didn't know the purpose or the name of. 

Street Six this year was a fifteen-metre wide stream of quickly flowing 
mercury covered with etched diamond sheeting; every now and again 
large coherent blobs of sparkling blue-gold went speeding along the 
mercury stream underfoot.  Apparently these were symbolised 
electrons or something.  The original idea had been to incorporate the 
mercury channels into the City transport system, but this had proved 
impractical and so they were there just for effect; the City tube 
system ran deep underground as usual.  Genar-Hofoen had jumped 
on and off a few of the underground cars on his way to the City and 
on and off a couple more once he'd arrived, hoping to give the slip to 
anybody following.  Having done this and had the tracer in his ear 
removed, he was happy he'd done the best he could to ensure that 
his evening's fun would take place unobserved by SC, though he 
wasn't particularly bothered if they were still watching him; it was 
more the principle of the thing.  No point getting obsessive about it. 

Street Six itself was packed with people, walking, talking, staggering, 
strolling, rolling along within bubblespheres, riding on exotically 
accoutred animals, riding in small carriages drawn by ysner-mistretl 
pairs and floating along under small vacuum balloons or in force field 
harnesses.  Above, in the eternal night sky beneath the City's vast 
dome, this part of the evening's entertainment was being provided 
by a city-wide hologram of an ancient bomber raid. 

The sky was filled with hundreds and hundreds of winged aircraft with 
four or six piston engines each, many of them picked out by 
searchlights.  Spasms of light leaving black-on-black clouds and 
blossoming spheres of dimming red sparks were supposed to be anti-
aircraft fire, while in amongst the bombers smaller single and twin-
engined aircraft whizzed; the two sorts of aircraft were shooting at 
each other, the large planes from turrets and the smaller ones from 
their wings and noses.  Gently curving lines of white, yellow and red 
tracer moved slowly across the sky and every now and again an 
aircraft seemed to catch fire and start to fall out of the sky; 
occasionally one would explode in mid air.  All the time, the dark 
shapes of bombs could be glimpsed, falling to explode with bright 

flashes and vivid gouts of flame on parts of the City seemingly always 
just a little way off.  Genar-Hofoen thought it all looked a little 
contrived, and he doubted there'd ever been such a concentrated air 
battle, or one in which the ground fire kept up while interceptor 
planes did their intercepting, but as a show it was undeniably 
impressive. 

Explosions, gunfire and sirens sounded above the chatter of people 
filling the street and was sporadically submerged by the music spilling 
from the hundreds of bars and multifarious enterεtainment venues 
lining the Street.  The air was full of half-strange, half-familiar, 
entirely enticing smells and wild pheremonic effects understandably 
banned everywhere else on Tier. 

Genar-Hofoen strolled down the middle of the Street, a large glass of 
Tier 9050 in one hand, a cloud cane in the other and a small puff-
creant nestling on one shoulder of his immaculately presented 
ownskin jacket.  The 9050 was a cocktail which notoriously involved 
about three hundred separate processes to make, many of them 
involving unlikely and even unpleasant combinations-of plants, 
animals and substances.  The end result was an acceptable if strong-
tasting drink composed largely of alcohol, no more, but you didn't 
really drink it for the internal effect, you drank it to show you could 
afford to; they put it in a special crystal field-goblet so you could show 
that you could.  The name was meant to imply that after sinking a 
few you were ninety per cent certain to get laid and fifty per cent 
assured of ending up in legal trouble (or it may have been the other 
way round - Genar-Hofoen could never remember). 

The cloud cane was a walking stick burning compressed pellets of a 
mildly and brief-acting psychotropic mixture; taking a suck on its 
pierced top cap was like sliding two distorting lenses in front of your 
eyes, sticking your head underwater and shoving a chemical factory 
up your nose while standing in a shifting gravity field. 

The puff-creant was a small symbiont, half animal half vegetaεble, 
which you paid to squat on your shoulder and cough up your nose 
every time you turned your face towards it.  The cough contained 
spores that could do any one of about thirty different and interesting 
things to your perceptions and moods. 

Genar-Hofoen was particularly pleased with his new suit.  It was 
made of his own skin, genetically altered in various subtle ways, 
specially 
vat-grown 
and 
carefully 
tailored 
to 
his 
exact 

specifications.  He'd donated a few skin cells to - and left the order 
and payment with - a gene-tailor here on Tier two and a half years 
earlier when he was on his way to God'shole habitat.  It had been a 
whim after a drinking session (as had an animated obscene tattoo 
he'd removed a month later).  He hadn't really expected to pick the 
suit up for a while.  Forεtunately long-term fashions hadn't changed 
too much in the interim.  The suit and its accompanying cloak looked 
terrific.  He felt great. spa'dassins digladiate; ziffidae and xebecs 
contend! gol-iard dunking! 

Slogans, signs, announcements, odours and personal greeters vied 
for attention, advertising emporia and venues.  Stunning 'scapes and 
scenes played out in sensorium bubbles bulging out into the centre 
of the street, putting you instantly into bedrooms, feast-halls, arenae, 
harems, seaships, fair rides, space battles, states of temporary 
ecstasy; tempting, prompting, suggesting, offering, providing 
entrance, stimulating appetites, prompting desires; sugεgesting, 
propositioning, pandering. 

RHYPAROGRAPHY!  KELOIDAL ANAMNESIS!  IVRESSE! 

Genar-Hofoen walked through it all, soaking it all in, refusing all the 
offers and suggestions, politely turning down the overtures and 
come-ons, the recommendations and invitations. 

ZUFULOS!  ORPHARIONS!  RASTRAE!  NAUMACHIA HOURLY! 

For now, he was content just to be here, walking, promenading, 
watching and being watched, sizing up and - with any luck - being 
sized up.  It was evening - real evening - in this level of Tier, the time 
when Night City started to become busy; everywhere was open, 
nowhere was full, everybody wanted your custom, but nobody was 
really settling on a venue yet; just cruising, grazing, petting.  Genar-
Hofoen was happy to be part of that general drift; he loved this, he 
gloried in it.  This was where he felt most himself.  For now, there 
was simply no better place to be, and he believed in entering into the 
experience with all due and respectful intensity; these were his sort 

of people, here was where his sort of thing happened and this was 
his sort of place. 

PILIOUS

OUR MARTICHORASTIC MINIKINS! 

He saw her outside a Sublimer sekos set under the rotundly swollen 
bulk of a building shaped like a giant resistor.  The entrance to the 
cult's sacred place was a brightly shining loop, like a thick but tiny 
rainbow layered in different shades of white.  Young Sublimers stood 
outside the enclosure, clad in glowing white robes.  The Sublimers - 
each tall and thin - glowed, too; their skin glowed gently, pallid to the 
point of unhealthy-looking bloodlessness.  Their eyes shone, soft light 
spilling from the wide, open whites, while the same half-silvery light 
was projected from their teeth when they smiled.  They smiled all the 
time, even when they were talking.  The woman was standing looking 
at the pair of enthusiastically gesticulating Sublimers with an 
expression of amused disdain. 

She was tall, tawny-skinned.  Her face was broad, her nose thin and 
almost parallel with the planes of her cheeks; her arms were crossed, 
her body tilted back from the two young people, her weight taken on 
one black-booted heel as she looked down that long nose at the 
shining Sublimers.  Her eyes and her hair looked as dark as the 
featureless shadowrobe which hid the rest of her frame. 

He stopped in the middle of the street and watched her arguing with 
the two Sublimers for a few moments.  Her gestures and the way she 
held her body were different but the face was very similar to the way 
he remembered her looking, forty years ago; just a little older, 
perhaps.  He had always wondered how much she'd changed. 

But it couldn't be her.  Tishlin had said she was still on board 
the Sleeper. They'd have mentioned if she'd left, wouldn't they? 

He let a group of squatly chortling Bystlians pass him, then 
saunεtered a little way back up the street, studying the architecture 
of the giant valve bulging over it from the opposite pavement and 
sniffing from his cloud cane in a vague, bored manner while watching 

a line of dark bombs flit out of the darkness above to fall and detonate 
somewhere beyond the line of barrel-like resistors that formed the 
other side of the street; bright yellow-orange explosions lit up the sky 
and debris rose slowly and fell.  Further up the avenue, some sort of 
commotion surrounded a large animal. 

He turned and looked back down the crowded street.  At that moment 
a giant blue-gold shape slid under his feet, rushing silently along 
within the mercury stream beneath the diamond plate.  The girl 
arguing with the Sublimers turned, glancing at the street as the blob 
went gliding past.  As she looked back to the two young glowing 
people she caught sight of him watching her.  Her gaze settled on 
him for a moment and the flicker of an expression - a glimmer of 
recognition? - passed briefly over her face before she started talking 
to the Sublimers again.  He hadn't had time to look away even if he'd 
wanted to. 

He was wondering whether he ought to go over to her now, wait and 
see if she stepped back into the thoroughfare and maybe approach 
her then, or just walk away, when a tall girl in a glowing gown stepped 
up to him and said, 'May I help you, sir?  You seem taken with our 
place of exaltation.  Do you have any questions you'd like to ask?  Is 
there anything I can do to enlighten you?' 

He turned to the Sublimer.  She was almost as tall as he; her face 
was pretty but somehow vacuous, though he knew that might have 
been prejudice on his part. 

Sublimers had turned what was a normal but generally optional part 
of a species' choice of fate into a religion.  Sublimers believed that 
everybody ought to Sublime, that every human, every animal, every 
machine and Mind ought to head straight for ultimate transcendence, 
leaving the mundane life behind and setting as direct a course as 
possible for nirvana. 

People who joined the cult spent a year trying to persuade others of 
this before they Sublimed themselves, joining one of the sect's group-
minds to contemplate irreality.  The few drones, other AIs and Minds 
that became persuaded of the merit of this course of action through 
the arguments of the Sublimers tended to do what any other machine 

did on such occasions and disappear in the direction of the nearest 
Sublimed Entity, though one or two stuck around in a pre-Sublimed 
state long enough to help the cause.  In general, though, the cult was 
regarded as rather a pointless one.  Subliming was seen as 
something that usually happened to entire societies, and more as a 
practical lifestyle alteration than a religious commitment; more like 
moving house than entering a sacred order. 

'Well, I don't know,' Genar-Hofoen said, sounding wary. 'What exactly 
do you people believe in again?' 

The Sublimer looked up the street behind him. 'Oh, we believe in the 
power of the Sublime,' she said. 'Let me tell you more.' She glanced 
up the avenue again. 'Oh; perhaps we ought to get off the street, 
don't you think?' She held out her hand and took a step back towards 
the pavement. 

Genar-Hofoen looked back, to where things were getting noisy.  The 
giant animal he'd noticed earlier - a sexipedal pondrosaur - was 
advancing slowly down the avenue in the midst of a retinue and a 
crowd of spectators.  The shaggy, brown-furred animal was six 
metres tall, splendidly liveried with long, gaudy banners and ribbons 
and commanded by a garishly uniformed mahout brandishing a fiery 
mace.  The beast was surmounted by a glitteringly black and silver 
cupola whose bulbously filigreed windows gave no hint of who or what 
might be inside; similarly ornamented bowls covered the great 
animal's eyes.  It was attended by five loping kliestrithrals, each 
black tusked creature pawing at the street surface and snorting and 
held on a tight lead by a burly hire guard.  A knot of people held the 
procession up; the pondrosaur paused and put its long head back to 
let out a surprisingly soft, subdued roar, then it adjusted its eye-cups 
with its two leg-thick fore-limbs and bobbed its head to either 
side.  The gaggle of promenaders began to disperse and the great 
beast and its escorts moved forward again. 

'Hmm, yes,' Genar-Hofoen said. 'Perhaps we'd better move out the 
way.' He finished the 9050 and looked round for a place to deposit 
the empty container. 

'Please; allow me.' The Sublimer girl took the field-goblet from him 
as though it was some sort of holy object.  Genar-Hofoen followed 
her onto the sidewalk; she put an arm through his and they 
proceeded slowly towards the entrance to the sekos, where the 
woman was still standing talking to the other two Sublimers with her 
look of ironic curiosity. 

'Have you heard of Sublimers before?' the girl on his arm asked. 

'Oh, yes,' he said, watching the other woman's face as they 
approached.  They stopped on the pavement outside the Sublimer 
building, entering a hushfield in which the only sound was gently 
tinkling music and a background of waves on a beach. 'You believe 
everybody should just sort of disappear up their own arses, don't 
you?' he asked with every appearance of innocence.  He was only a 
few metres from the woman in the shadowrobe, though the 
compartmented hushfield meant he couldn't hear what she was 
saying.  Her face was much like he remembered it; the eyes and 
mouth were the same.  She had never worn her hair up like that, but 
even its shade of black-blue was the same. 

'Oh, no!' the Sublimer girl said, her expression terribly serious. 'What 
we believe in takes one completely away from such bodily concerns…' 

Out of the corner of his eye he could see up the street, where the 
pondrosaur was shuffling forwards through a thick crowd of 
admirers.  He smiled at the Sublimer girl as she talked on.  He shifted 
a little so that he could see the other woman better. 

No, it wasn't her.  Of course it wasn't.  She'd have recognised him, 
she'd have reacted by now.  Even if she'd been trying to pretend she 
hadn't seen him he'd have been able to tell; she'd never been very 
good at hiding her feelings from anybody, least of all from him.  She 
glanced at him again, then quickly away.  He felt a sudden, unbidden 
sensation of fearful pleasure, a jolt of excitement which left his skin 
tingling. 

'… highest expression of our quintessential urge to be greater than 
we…' He nodded and looked at the Sublimer girl, who was still 
babbling away.  He frowned a little and stroked his chin with his free 

hand, still nodding.  He kept watching the other woman.  Out on the 
street, the pondrosaur and its retinue had come to a stop almost 
alongside them; a Tier Sintricate was hovering level with the giant 
animal's mahout, who seemed to be arguing angrily with it. 

The woman was smiling at the other two Sublimers with what 
appeared to be an expression of tolerant ridicule.  She kept her eyes 
on the Sublimer fellow doing the talking at that point, but took a long, 
deep breath, and - just as she let it out - glanced at Genar-Hofoen 
again with the briefest of smiles and a flick of her eyebrows before 
looking back at the Sublimers and tipping her head just a little to one 
side. 

He wondered.  Would SC really go this far to keep him under their 
control, or at least under their eye?  How likely was it that he should 
find somebody who looked so much like her?  He supposed there 
must be hundreds of people who bore a passing resemblance to Dajeil 
Gelian; perhaps there were even a few who had heard something 
about her and deliberately assumed her appearance; that happened 
all the time with genuinely famous people and just because he'd 
never heard of anybody taking on Dajeil's looks didn't mean nobody 
had ever done so.  If this person was one of them, it was just possible 
he would have to be on his guard… 

'… personal ambition or the desire to better oneself or to provide 
opportunities for one's children is but a pale reflection of, compared 
to the ultimate transcendence which true Subliming offers; for, as it 
is written…' 

Genar-Hofoen leant closer to the girl talking to him and tapped her 
lightly on the shoulder. 'I'm sure,' he said quietly. 'Would you excuse 
me for just a moment?' 

He took the two steps over to the woman in the shadowrobe.  She 
turned her head from the two Sublimers and smiled politely at him. 
'Excuse me,' he asked. 'Don't I know you from somewhere?' He 
grinned as he said it, acknowledging both the well-worn nature of the 
line and the fact that neither he nor she was really interested in what 
the Sublimers had to say. 

She nodded her head politely to him. 'I don't think so,' she said.  Her 
voice was higher than Dajeil's; more girlish, and with a quite different 
accent. 'Though if we had met and you hadn't altered in some way 
and I'd forgotten, certainly I'd be far too ashamed to admit it.' She 
smiled.  He did the same.  She frowned. 'Unless… do you live on 
Tier?' 

'Just passing through,' he told her.  A bomber, in flames, tore past 
just overhead and exploded in a burst of light behind the Sublimer 
building.  On the street, the argument around the pondrosaur 
seemed to be getting more heated; the animal itself was staring 
intently at the Sintricate and its mahout was standing up on its neck, 
pointing the flaming mace at the darkly spiny being to emphasise 
whatever points he was making. 

'But I've been this way before,' Genar-Hofoen said. 'Perhaps we 
bumped into each other then.' 

She nodded thoughtfully. 'Perhaps,' she conceded. 

'Oh, you two know each other?' said the young Sublimer man she'd 
been talking to. 'Well, many people find that Subliming in the 
company of a loved one or just somebody they know is-' 

'Do you play Calascenic Crasis?' she asked, cutting across the young 
Sublimer. 'You may have seen me at a game here.' She put her head 
back, looking down that long nose at him. 'If so, I'm disappointed you 
left it till now to say hello.' 

'Ah!' the Sublimer lad said. 'Games; an expression of the urge to 
enter into worlds beyond ourselves!  Another-' 

'I've never even heard of the game,' he confessed. 'Do you 
recommend it?' 

'Oh yes,' she said, and sounded ironic. 'It benefits all who play.' 

'Well, I'm always willing to entertain some new experience.  Perhaps 
you could teach me.' 

'Ah, now; the ultimate new experience-' began the Sublimer lad. 

Genar-Hofoen turned to him and said, 'Oh, shut up!' It had been an 
instinctive reaction, and for a moment he was worried he might have 
said the wrong thing, but she didn't seem to be regarding the young 
Sublimer's hurt look with any great degree of sympathy. 

She looked back to him. 'All right,' she said. 'You stand me my stake 
and I'll teach you Crasis.' 

He smiled, wondering if that had been too easy. 'It's a deal,' he 
said.  He waved the cloud cane under his nose and took a deep 
breath, then bowed. 'My name's Byr.' 

'Pleased to meet you.' She nodded again. 'Call me Flin,' she said, and, 
taking hold of the cane, waved it under her own nose. 

'Shall we, Flin?' he said, and indicated the street beyond, where the 
pondrosaur had sunk to its belly, its four legs doubled up 
underεneath it and both fore-limbs folded beneath its chin, as though 
bored.  Two Sintricates were shouting at the enraged mahout, who 
was shaking the flaming mace at them.  The hire guards were looking 
nervous and patting the restless kliestrithrals. 

'Certainly.' 

'Remember where you met!' the Sublimer called after them. 
'Subliming is the ultimate meeting of souls, the pinnacle of…' They 
left the hushfield.  His voice was drowned out by the thudding of 
projected anti-aircraft fire as they walked along the pavement. 

'So, where are we going?' he asked her. 

'Well, you can take me for a drink and then we'll hit a Crasis bar I 
know.  Sound all right?' 

'Sounds fine.  Shall we take a trap?' he said, pointing a little way up 
the street to a two-wheeled open vehicle waiting by the kerb.  A 
ysner-mistretl pair were harnessed between the traces, the ysner 
craning its long neck down to peck at a feed bag in the gutter, the 

small, smartly uniformed mistretl on its back looking around alertly 
and tapping its thumbs together. 

'Good idea,' she said.  They walked up to the trap and climbed 
aboard. 'The Collyrium Lounge,' the woman said to the mistretl as 
they sat in the rear of the small vehicle.  It saluted and pulled a whip 
out from its fancy jerkin.  The ysner made a sighing noise. 

The trap shook suddenly.  A great deep burst of noise came from the 
street behind them.  They all looked round.  The pondrosaur was 
rearing up, bellowing; its mahout nearly fell off its neck.  His mace 
tumbled from his grasp and bounced on the street.  Two of the 
kliestrithrals jumped up and leapt into the crowd, snarling and 
dragging their handlers with them.  The two Sintricates who'd been 
arguing with the mahout rose quickly into the air out of the way; 
people in float harnesses took avoiding action through the confusion 
of searchlight beams and anti-aircraft fire.  Flin and Genar-Hofoen 
watched people scatter in all directions as the pondrosaur leapt 
forward with surprising agility and started charging down the street 
towards them.  The mahout clung desεperately to the beast's ears, 
screeching at it to stop.  The stabilised black and silver cupola on the 
animal's back seemed to float along above it until the animal's 
increasing speed forced it to oscillate from side to side.  At Genar-
Hofoen's side, Flin seemed frozen. 

Genar-Hofoen glanced round at the mistretl. 'Well,' he said, 'let's get 
going.' The little mistretl blinked quickly, still staring up the 
street.  Another bellow echoed off the surrounded buildings.  Genar-
Hofoen looked back again. 

The charging pondrosaur reached up with one fore-limb and ripped 
its eye-cups off to reveal huge, faceted blue eyes like chunks of 
ancient ice.  With its other limb it gripped the mahout by one shoulder 
and wrenched him off its neck; he wriggled and flailed but it brushed 
him to one side and onto the pavement; he landed running, fell and 
rolled.  The pondrosaur itself thundered on down the street; people 
threw themselves out of its way.  Somebody in a bubblesphere didn't 
move fast enough; the giant transparent ball was kicked to the side, 
smashing into a hot food-stall; flames leapt from the wreckage. 

'Shit,' Genar-Hofoen said as the giant bore down upon them.  He 
turned to the mistretl driver again.  He could see the face of the 
ysner, turned back to look up the street behind too, its big face 
expressing only mild surprise. 'Move!' he shouted. 

The mistretl nodded. 'Goo' i'ea,' it chirped.  It reached behind to slip 
a knot on the rear of the ysner and jabbed its bootheels into the 
animal's lower neck.  The startled ysner took off, leaving the trap 
behind; the vehicle tipped forward as the ysner-mistretl pair 
disappeared down the rapidly clearing street.  Genar-Hofoen and Flin 
were thrown forward in a tangle of harnesses.  He heard her shout, 
'Fuck!' then go oof as they hit the street. 

Something hit him hard on the head.  He blacked out for a moment 
then came to looking up at a huge face, a monstrous face, gazing 
down at him with huge prismed blue eyes.  Then he saw the woman's 
face.  The face of Dajeil Gelian.  She had blood on her top lip.  She 
looked groggily at him and then turned to gaze up at the huge animal 
face looking down at them.  There was a sort of buzzing sensation 
from somewhere; Genar-Hofoen felt his legs go numb.  The woman 
collapsed over his legs.  He felt sick.  Lines of red dots crossing the 
sky floated behind his eyelids when they closed.  When he forced his 
eyes open again, she was there again.  Somebody looking like Dajeil 
Gelian who wasn't her.  Except it wasn't Flin either.  She was dressed 
differently, she was taller and her expression was… not the 
same.  And anyway, Flin was still draped unconscious over his legs. 

He really didn't understand what was going on.  He shook his 
head.  This hurt. 

The girl who wasn't Dajeil or Flin stooped quickly, looked into his 
eyes, whirled the cloak off her shoulders and onto the street beside 
him in one movement, then rolled him over onto it, heaving Flin's 
immobile body out of the way as she did so.  He tried waving his arms 
around but it didn't do much good. 

The cloak went rigid underneath him and floated into the air, 
wrapping round him.  He cried out and tried to fight against its 
enclosing black folds, but the buzzing came again and his vision faded 
even before the cloak finished wrapping itself round him. 

8. Killing Time 

I 

The usual way to explain it was by analogy; this was how the idea 
was introduced to you as a child.  Imagine you were travelling 
through space and you came to this planet which was very big and 
almost perfectly smooth and on which there lived creatures who were 
composed of one layer of atoms; in effect, two-dimensional.  These 
creatures would be born, live and die like us and they might well 
possess genuine intelligence.  They would, initially, have no idea or 
grasp of the third dimension, but they would be able to live perfectly 
well in their two dimensions.  To them, a line would be like a wall 
across their world (or, from the end, it would look like a point).  An 
unbroken circle would be like a locked room. 

Perhaps, if they were able to build machines which allowed them to 
journey at great speed along the surface of their planet - which to 
them would be their universe - they would go right round the planet 
and come back to where they had started from.  More likely, they 
would be able to work this out from theory.  Either way, they would 
realise that their universe was both closed, and curved, and that there 
was, in fact, a third dimension, even if they had no practical access 
to it.  Being familiar with the idea of circles, they would probably 
christen the shape of their universe a 'hypercircle' rather than 
inventing a new word.  The three-dimensional people would, of 
course, call it a sphere. 

The situation was similar for people living in three dimensions.  At 
some point in any civilisation starting to become advanced it was 
realised that if you set off into space in what appeared to be a 
perfectly straight line, eventually you would arrive back at where you 
started, because your three-dimensional universe was really a four-
dimensional shape; being familiar with the idea of spheres, people 
tended to christen this shape a hypersphere. 

Usually around the same point in a society's development it was 
understood that - unlike the planet where the two-dimensional 
creatures lived - space was not simply curved into a hypersphere, it 

was also expanding; gradually increasing in size like a soap-bubble 
on the end of a straw which somebody was blowing into.  To a four-
dimensional being looking from far enough away, the three-
dimensional galaxies would look like tiny designs imprinted onto the 
surface of that expanding bubble, each of them, generally, heading 
away from all the others because of the hypersphere's general 
expansion, but - like the shifting whorls and loops of colour visible on 
the skin of a soap bubble - able to slide and move around on that 
surface. 

Of course, the four-dimensional hypersphere had no equivalent of the 
straw, blowing air in from outside.  The hypersphere was expanding 
all by itself, like a four-dimensional explosion, with the implication 
that, once, it had been simply a point; a tiny seed which had indeed 
exploded.  That detonation had created - or at least had produced - 
matter and energy, time and the physical laws themselves.  Later - 
cooling, coalescing and changing over immense amounts of time and 
expansion - it had given rise to the cool, ordered, three-dimensional 
universe which people could see around them. 

Eventually in the progress of a technologically advanced society, 
occasionally after some sort of limited access to hyperspace, more 
usually after theoretical work, it was realised that the soap bubble 
was not alone.  The expanding universe lay inside a larger one, which 
in turn was entirely enclosed by a bubble of space-time with a still 
greater diameter.  The same applied within the universe you 
happened to find yourself on/in; there were smaller, younger 
universes inside it, nested within like layers of paper round a much-
wrapped spherical present. 

In the very centre of all the concentric, inflating universes lay the 
place they had each originated from, where every now and again a 
cosmic fireball blinked into existence, detonating once more to 
produce another universe, its successive outpourings of creation like 
the explosions of some vast combustion engine, and the universes its 
pulsing exhaust. 

There was more; complications in seven dimensions and beyond that 
involved a giant torus on which the 3-D universe could be described 
as a circle, contained and containing other nested tori, with further 

implications of whole populations of such meta-Realities… but the 
implications of multiple, concentric, sequential universes was 
generally considered enough to be going on with for the moment. 

What everybody wanted to know was whether there was any way of 
travelling from one universe to another.  Between any pair of 
universes there was more than just empty hyperspace; there was a 
thing called an energy grid.  It was useful - strands of it could help 
power ships, and it had been used as a weapon - but it was also an 
obstacle, and - by all accounts so far - one which had proved 
impenetrable to intelligent investigation.  Certain black holes 
appeared to be linked to the grid and perhaps therefore to the 
universe beyond, but nobody had ever made it intact into one, or ever 
reappeared in any recognisable form.  There were white holes, too; 
ferociously violent sources spraying torrents of energy into the 
universe with the power of a million suns and which also seemed to 
be linked to the grid… but no body, no ship or even information had 
ever been observed appearing from their tumultuous mouths; no 
equivalent of an airborne bacteria, no word, no language, just that 
incoherent scream of cascading energies and super energetic 
particles. 

The dream that every Involved had, which virtually every 
technologically advanced civilisation clove to with almost religious 
faith, was that one day it would be possible to travel from one 
universe to another, to step up or down through those expanding 
bubbles, so that - apart from anything else - one need never suffer 
the final fate of one's own universe.  To achieve that would surely be 
to Sublime, truly to Transcend, to consummate the ultimate 
Surpassing and accomplish the ultimate empowerment. 

to the lower layer of energy grid… and a second leading upwards to 
the higher layer. 

The Excession was doing exactly what it had been doing for the past 
two weeks; nothing.  The Fate Amenable To Change had carried out 
all the standard initial measurements and observations of the entity, 
but had been very forcefully advised indeed not to do any more; no 
direct contact was to be attempted, not even by probes, smaller craft 
or drones.  In theory it could disobey; it was its own ship, it could 
make up its own mind… but in practice it had to heed the advice of 
those who knew if not more than it, better than it. 

Collective responsibility.  Also known as sharing the blame. 

So all it had done after the first exciting bit, when it had been the 
centre of attention and everybody had wanted to know all it could tell 
them about the thing it had found, had been to hang around here, 
still at the focus of events in a sense, but also feeling somehow 
ignored. 

Reports.  It filed reports.  It had long since stopped trying to make 
them different or original. 

The ship was bored.  It was also aware of a continuing underεcurrent 
of fear; a real emotion that it was by turns annoyed at, ashamed of 
and indifferent to, according to its mood. 

It waited.  It watched.  Beyond it, around it, most of its small fleet of 
modules and satellites, a few of its most space-capable drones and a 
variety of specialist devices it had constructed specifically for the 
purpose also floated, watching and waiting.  Inside the vessel its 
human crew discussed the situation, monitored the data coming in 
from the ship's own sensors and those coming in from the small cloud 
of dispersed machines.  The ship passed some of the time by making 
up elaborate games for the humans to play.  Meanwhile it kept up its 
observation of the Excession and scanned the space around, waiting 
for the first of the other ships to arrive. 

Sixteen days after the Culture craft had stumbled upon the Excession 
and six days after the discovery had been made public, the first ship 
appeared, its presence noted initially within the Fate Amenable To 
Change's main sensor array.  The GCU moved one state of readiness 
higher, signalled what was happening to the Ethics Gradient and 
the Not Invented Here, fastened its track scanner on the incoming 
signal, began a tentative reconfiguration of its remote sensor 
platforms and started to move towards the newcomer round the 
perimeter of the Excession's safe limit at a speed it hoped was pitched 
nicely between polite deliberation and alarm-raising urgency.  It sent 
a standard interrogatory signal burst to the approaching craft. 

The vessel was the Sober Counsel, an Explorer Ship of the Zetetic 
Elench's Stargazer Clan's Fifth fleet.  The Fate Amenable To 
Change felt relief; the Elench were friends. 

Identifications completed, the two ships rendezvoused, locally 
stationary just a few tens of kilometres apart on the outskirts of the 
safe limit from the Excession the Culture vessel had set. 

~ Welcome. 

~ Thank you…  Dear holy stasis.  Is that thing attached to the grid, 
or is it my sensors? 

~ If it's your sensors, it's mine too.  Impressive, isn't it?  Becomes 
greatly less so once you've sat looking at it for a week or two, take 
my word for it.  I hope you're just here to observe.  That's all I'm 
doing. 

~ Waiting on the big guns? 

~ That's right. 

~ When do they arrive? 

~ That's restricted.  Promise this won't go outside the Elench? 

~ Promise. 

~ A Medium SV gets here in twelve days; the first General SV in 
fourteen, then one every few days for a week, then one a day, then 
several a day, by which time I expect a few other Involveds will 
probably have started to show.  Don't ask me what the GSVs will 
consider a quorum before they act.  How about you? 

~ Can we talk off the record, just the two of us? 

~ All right. 

~ We have another ship heading here, two days away still.  The rest 
of the fleet are still undecided, though they have stopped drawing 
further away.  We lost a ship somewhere round here.  The Peace 
Makes Plenty. 

~ Ah.  Did you indeed?  About when? 

~ Some time between 28.789 and 805. 

~ This is still confidential within the Elench, then? 

~ Yes.  We searched this volume as best we could for two weeks but 
found nothing.  What brought you here? 

~ Suggestion by my home GSV, the Ethics Gradient. That was in 
841.  Wanted me to look in the Upper Leaf Swirl Cloud Top.  No 
reason given.  Bumped into this on the way there.  That's all I know. 
(And the Fate Amenable To Change thought coldly about that 
suggestion.  The Cloud Top volume was a long way from here, but 
that meant nothing.  What mattered was that it had been given a 
relatively precise location within the Cloud Top to head for, and been 
given the subtlest of hints to watch out for anything interesting while 
en route.  Given where it had been when it had received the 
suggestion from its home GSV, its route had inevitably taken it near 
the Excession…  Thirty-six days had elapsed between the date the 
Elench knew they might have lost a ship and the time when it had 
been dispatched on what was starting to look a little like a set-up… It 
wondered what had taken place in between.  Could some Elench ship 
have leaked word to the Culture?  But then how had such a leak 
apparently produced such accuracy, given that it, a single ship, had 

practically run straight into the damn Excession, while the Elench had 
spent two weeks here with seven-eighths of a full fleet and spotted 
nothing?) ~ Feel free to ask the Ethics Gradient what prompted its 
suggestion, it added. 

~ Thank you. 

~ You're welcome. 

~ I'd like to try contacting the Excession.  This might be where our 
comrade 
disappeared.  At 
the 
least 
it 
might 
have 
some 

inforεmation.  At most, and for all we know, our ship is still in 
there.  I want to talk to it, maybe send a drone-ship in if it doesn't 
reply. 

~ 
Madness.  This 
thing 
is 
welded 
into 
the 
grids, 
both 

directions.  Know anything that can do that?  Me neither.  I'm not 
even going to start feeling safe until there's a fleet of GSVs round 
here.  Heck, I was pleased to see you there; Company at last, I 
thought.  Somebody to pass the time with while I sit out my lonely 
vigil.  Now you want to start poking this thing with a stick.  Are you 
crazy? 

~ No, but we might have a ship in distress in there.  I can't just sit 
here doing nothing.  Have you attempted to contact the entity? 

~ No.  I sent back a pro forma to its initial Hello, but… wait a 
moment.  Look at the signal it sent (signal enclosed). 

~ There.  You see?  I told you!  That was probably an Elench-sourced 
handshake burst. 

~ Meatshit.  Yes, I see.  Well, maybe your pal did find the damn thing 
first, but if it did, it probably did exactly what you're proposing to 
do.  And it's gone.  Disappeared.  You seeing where this is leading? 

~ I intend to be careful. 

~ Uh-huh.  Was your comrade vessel notoriously careless? 

~ Indeed not. 

~ Well then. 

~ I appreciate your concern.  Was there any sign of contention in the 
volume when you got here?  Emergency or distress signals?  Voyage 
Event Record Ejectiles? 

~ There was this, here (material analysis/location enclosed), but if 
you want to mention any of this stuff on record you'd better make it 
look like you just stumbled across the debris, all right? 

~ Thank you.  Yes, of course…  Looks like one of our little-drones was 
caught up in something.  Hmm.  Sort of… smells subsidiary 
somehow, don't you think? 

~ Possibly.  I know what you mean.  It's untidy. 

~ Back on record? 

~ Okay. 

~ I hereby give notice I intend to attempt to contact the entity. 

~ I beg you not to.  Let me make a request that you be allowed to 
take part in the Culture investigation when it takes place.  I'm sure 
there is every chance you will be welcome to share in the relevant 
data. 

~ I'm sorry, I have my own reasons for considering the matεter 
urgent. 

~ Off record again? 

~ All right. 

~ My records show you to be - to all intents and purposes - identical 
to the Peace Makes Plenty. 

~ Yes.  Go on? 

~ Don't you see?  Look, if this thing jeopardised your comrade with 
no more fuss than an escaped little-drone, what's it going to be able 

to do now that it's had a chance to pick over the structure and mind-
set of your sister craft for at least sixty-six days? 

~ I have the benefit of being forewarned.  And the entity may not 
have been able entirely to take over the Peace Makes Plenty yet.  The 
ship might be inside there, under siege.  Perhaps all the entity's 
intellectual energies are being absorbed in the maintenance of that 
blockade.  That being the case my intervention may lift the siege and 
free my comrade. 

~ Cousin, this is self-delusion.  We have already dealt with the issue 
of the minimal extra safeguarding provided by you having been 
alerted to the entity's potential danger; the Peace Makes Plenty could 
hardly have been less prepared.  I appreciate your feelings towards 
your fellow craft and Fleet-mate, but it rends the bounds of possibility 
to believe that something capable of perpetuating E-grid links in both 
directions is going to be substantially troubled by craft with the 
capabilities of ourselves.  The Excession has not troubled me but then 
I did not trouble it; we exchanged greetings, no more.  What you 
propose might be construed as interference, or even as a hostile 
act.  I have accepted a duty to observe and won't be able to help you 
if you get into trouble.  Please, please reconsider. 

~ I take your point.  I still intend to attempt communication with the 
entity but I shall not recommend that a drone approach be made.  I 
have to put all this to my humans, of course, but they usually concur. 

- Naturally.  I urge you to argue strongly against sending any object 
towards the Excession, should your human crew suggest this. 

~ I'll see which way they jump.  This could take a while; they like 
arguing. 

~ Don't be in any rush on my account.

The Torturer class Rapid Offensive Unit Killing Time swung out of the 
darkness between the stars and braked hard, scrubbing velocity off 
in a wild, extravagant flare of energies which briefly left a livid line of 

disturbance across the surface of the energy grid.  It came to a local-
relative stop a light month out from the cold, dark, slowly tumbling 
body that was the ship store Pittance, some way beyond the outside 
edge of the tiny world's spherical cloud of defence/attack 
mechanisms.  It flashed a Permission-To-Approach signal at the rock.

Under way.  Heaving to at 2km from your rotational envelope in thirty

They had re-sealed the airlocks from the accommodation section and 
pumped 
in 
some 
real 
atmosphere.  Commander 
Risingmoon 

Parchseason IV of the Farsight tribe had been able to shed his space 
suit some days earlier.  The gravity was still far too mild but it was 
better than floating.  The Commander clicked his beak at the image 
on the screen presented by the mobile command centre they'd set up 
in what had been the humans' pool/growing unit.  A lieutenant at the 
Commander's side spoke quietly but urgently to the twenty other 
Affronters distributed throughout the base's caverns, letting them 
know what was going on. 

The Commander looked back impatiently, waiting for the servant 
who'd been sent to fetch his suit the instant the Culture warship had 
appeared on the other craft's sensors.  On secondary screens, he 
could see suited Affronter technicians, their machines and some 
slaved drones working on the exteriors of the stored ships.  They had 
about half of them ready to get out and go; a decent fleet, but they 
needed the rest, and preferably all at once, and as a complete 
surprise to the Culture and everybody else. 

'Can't you destroy it?' the Commander asked the traitor Culture 
vessel.  He glanced at the status of the nearest Affront vessels.  Far 

too far away.  They had avoided approaching Pittance in case they 
could be monitored by other Culture craft. 

The Attitude Adjuster didn't like vocalising; it preferred to print out 
its side of a conversation: 

~ If it gets to within a few minutes, yes, perhaps.  It might have been 
relatively 
easy, 
if 
I 
could 
have 
caught 
it 
completely 

unawares.  However, I doubt that was ever very likely given that it 
must have been suspicious to come here in the first place and is 
almost certainly completely out of the question now. 

'What about the ships we've cleared?' 

~ Commander, they haven't been woken up yet.  Until I've done that 
they're useless.  And if we wake half of them now they'll have too 
long to think, too much time to do their own checking around before 
we need them for the main action.  Our project must all happen in a 
rush, in a state of perceived chaos, panic and urgency, or it cannot 
happen effectively at all. 

There was a pause while the message scrolled along and off the 
screen, then: 

~ Commander, I suspect this will be a formality, but I have to ask; 
do you wish to admit to what has happened here and turn your 
command over without a fight to the ROU Killing Time? This will 
probably be our last opportunity to avoid hostilities. 

'Don't be ridiculous,' the Commander said sourly. 

~ I thought not.  Very well.  I shall vector away in the skein-shadow 
of the rock and try to loop round behind the ROU.  Let it enter the 
defence system.  Wait until it's a week inside, no more, and then set 
everything you have upon it.  I urge you again, Commander; turn 
over the tactical command apparatus to me. 

'No,' the Commander said. 'Leave and do whatever you think will best 
jeopardise the Culture vessel.  I shall allow it to arrive at a point three 
weeks in and then attack.' 

~ I am on my way.  Do not let the ship come within a light week of 
the store itself, Commander.  I know how it will think if it is attacked; 
this is not some genteel Orbital Mind or a nicely timorous General 
Contact Unit; this is a Culture warship showing every sign of being 
fully armed and ready to press matters. 

'What, creeping in as it is?' the Commander sneered. 

~ Commander, you would be amazed and appalled at how few bright 
sides there are concerning the appearance and behaviour of a warship 
like this.  The fact it's not charging in through the defence screen and 
metaphorically skidding to a stop is almost certainly a bad sign; it 
probably means it's one of the wily ones.  I repeat; do not wait until 
it is most of the way into the defence system before opening 
fire.  Assaulted so far inside the defensive field it may well figure that 
it has no chance of escape and so might as well continue towards you 
and attack, and at that sort of range it would stand a decent chance 
of being able to obliterate the entire store and all the ships within it. 

The Commander felt almost annoyed that the ship hadn't appealed to 
his own personal sense of self-preservation. 'Very well,' he snapped. 
'Half way in; two weeks.' 

~ Commander, no!  That is still too close.  If we cannot destroy the 
ship in the first instant of the engagement it must be presented with 
a reasonable opportunity to escape, otherwise it may go for glory 
rather than attempt to extricate itself. 

'But if it escapes it can alert the Culture!' 

~ If our attack is not immediately successful it will signal elsewhere 
anyway, assuming it has not already done so.  We shall not be able 
to stop it.  In that case, we shall have been discovered… though with 
any luck that will only put our plans out by a few days.  Believe me, 
the craft's physical escape will not bring the Culture here any quicker 
than a signal would.  You will be putting this entire mission in 
jeopardy if you allow the vessel to come within more than three light 
weeks of the store. 

'All right!' the Commander spat.  He flicked a tentacle over the 
glowing board of the command desk.  The communication link was 
cut.  The Attitude Adjuster did not attempt to re-establish it. 

'Your suit, sir,' said a voice from behind.  The Commander whirled 
round to find the gelding midshipman - uniformed but not suited - 
with his space suit in his limbs. 

'Oh, at last!  the Commander screamed; he flicked a tentacle at the 
creature's eye stalks; the blow bounced them back off its casing.  The 
gelding whimpered and fell back, gas sac deflating.  The Commander 
grabbed his suit and pulled himself inside it.  The midshipman 
staggered along the floor, half blinded. 

The Commander ordered his lieutenant to reconfigure the command 
desk.  From here they could personally control all the systems that 
had been entrusted by the Culture to the Mind which the traitor ship 
had killed.  The command desk was like an ultimate instrument of 
destruction; a giant keyboard to play death tunes on.  Some of the 
keys, admittedly, had to be left to trigger themselves once set, but 
these controls really did control. 

The holo screen projected a sphere out towards the Commander.  The 
globe displayed the volume of real space around Pittance, with tiny 
green, white and gold flecks representing major components of the 
defence system.  A dull blue dot represented the approaching 
warship, coasting in towards them.  Another dot, bright red, on the 
directly opposite side of the ship store from the blue dot and much 
closer - though drawing quickly away - was the traitor ship Attitude 
Adjuster. 

Another screen alongside showed an abstracted hyperspatial view of 
the same situation, indicating the two ships on different surfaces of 
the skein.  A third screen showed a transparent abstract of Pittance 
itself, detailing its ship-filled caverns and surface and internal defence 
systems. 

The Commander finished getting into his space suit and powerεing it 
up.  He settled back into position.  He reviewed the situation.  He 
knew better than to try to conduct matters at a tactical level, but he 

appreciated the strategic influence he could wield here.  He was 
dreadfully tempted, all the same, to take personal control and fire all 
the defence systems personally, but he was aware of the enormous 
responsibility he had been given in this mission and was equally 
conscious that he had been carefully selected for this task.  He had 
been chosen because he knew when not to - what had the traitor ship 
called it?  Go for glory.  He knew when not to go for glory.  He knew 
when to back off, when to take advice, when to retreat and regroup. 

He flicked open the communicator channel to the traitor ship. 'Did the 
warship stop exactly a light month out?' he asked. 

~ Yes. 

'That's thirty-two standard Culture days.' 

~ Correct. 

'Thank you.' He closed the channel. 

He looked at the lieutenant at his side. 'Set everything within range 
to open fire on the warship the instant it crosses the eight-point one 
days' limit.' He sat back as the lieutenant's limbs flickered over the 
holo displays, putting his command into effect.  Only just in time, the 
Commander noted.  He'd been longer getting into his suit than he'd 
thought. 

'Forty seconds, sir,' the lieutenant said. 

'… Give it just enough time to relax,' the Commander said, more to 
himself than to anybody else. 'If that is how these things work…' 

Exactly eight and a tenth light days in from the position the Rapid 
Offensive Unit Killing Time had held while negotiating its permission 
to approach, space all around the blue dot on the screen scintillated 
abruptly as a thousand hidden devices of a dozen different types 
suddenly erupted into life in a precisely ordered sequence of 
destruction; in the real-space holo sphere it looked like a miniaturised 
stellar cluster suddenly bursting into existence all around the blue 
dot.  The trace disappeared instantly inside a brilliant sphere of 

light.  In the hyperspace holo sphere, the dot lasted a little longer; 
slowed down, it could be seen firing some munitions back for a 
microsecond or so, then it too disappeared in the wash of energies 
bursting out of the real-space skein and into hyperspace in twin 
bulging plumes. 

The lights in the accommodation space flickered and dimmed as 
monumental amounts of power suddenly diverted to the rock's own 
long-range weaponry. 

The Commander left the comm channel to the traitor ship open.  Its 
own course had altered the instant the defence weaponry had been 
unleashed; now its course was hooked, changing colour from red to 
blue and curving up and round and vectoring in hyperspace too, 
looping round to the point where the slowly fading and dissipating 
radiation shells marked the focus of the system's annihilatory power. 

A flat screen to the Commander's left wavered, as if some still greater 
power surge had sucked energy even from its protected circuits.  A 
message flashed up on it: 

~ Missed, you fuckers! the legend read. 

'What?' the Commander said. 

The display flashed once and came clear again. 

~ Commander; the Attitude Adjuster here again.  As you may have 
gathered, we have failed. 

'What?  But.. !' 

~ Keep all defence and sensory systems at maximum readiness; 
ramp the sensor arrays up to significant degradation point in a week; 
we shall not need them beyond then. 

'But what happened?  We got it!' 

~ I shall move to plug the gap the attack left in our defences.  Ready 
all the cleared ships for immediate awakening; I may have to rouse 
them within a day or two.  Complete the tests on the Displacers; use 

a real ship if you have to.  And run a total level-zero systems check 
of your own equipment; if the ship was able to insert a message into 
your command desk it may have been able to carry out more 
pertinent mischief therein. 

The Commander slammed a limb end down on the desk. 'What is 
going on?' he roared. 'We got the bastard, didn't we?' 

~ 
No, 
Commander.  We 
'got' 
some 
sort 
of 
shuttle 
or 

module.  Somewhat faster and better equipped than the average 
example such a ship would normally carry, but possibly constructed 
en route with such a ruse in mind.  Now we know why its approach 
appeared so politely leisurely. 

The Commander peered into the holo spheres, juggling with 
magnifications and field-depths. 'Then where the hell is it?' 

~ Give me control of the primary scanner, Commander, just for a 
moment, will you? 

The Commander fumed in his space suit for a moment, then nodded 
his eye stalks at the lieutenant. 

The second holo sphere became a narrow, dark cone and swung so 
that the wide end was directed towards the ceiling.  Pittance glowed 
at the very point of the other end of the projection, the screen of 
defence devices reduced to a tiny florette of coloured light, close in 
to the cone's point.  At the far, wide end there was a tiny, fiercely, 
almost painfully red dot. 

~ There is the good ship Killing Time, Commander.  It set off at 
almost the same time I did.  Regrettably, it is both quicker and faster 
than I.  It has already done us the honour of copying to me the signal 
it sent to the rest of the Culture the moment we opened fire on its 
emissary.  I'll transmit you a copy too, minus the various, venomous 
unpleasantnesses directed specifically at myself.  Thank you for the 
use of your control desk.  You can have it back now. 

The cone collapsed to become a sphere again.  The traitor ship's last 
message scrolled off the side of the flat screen.  The Commander and 

the lieutenant looked at each other.  The small screen came up with 
another incoming signal. 

~ Oh, and will you contact Affront High Command, or shall 
I?  Somebody had better tell them we're at war with the Culture. 

III 

Genar-Hofoen woke up with a headache it took minutes to calm 
down; performing the relevant pain-management inside his head 
took far too much concentration for somebody feeling this bad to 
perform quickly.  He felt like he was a child on a beach, swinging a 
toy spade and building a sea wall all around him as the tide rushed 
in; waves kept over-topping and he was constantly shovelling sand 
up to small breaches in his defences, and the worst of it was the more 
sand he piled up the deeper he dug and higher he had to 
throw.  Eventually water started seeping in from the bottom of his 
sea fort, and he gave in; he just blanketed all pain.  If somebody 
started holding flames to his feet or he jammed his fingers in a door 
that'd just be too bad.  He knew better than to shake his head, so he 
imagined shaking his head; he'd never had a hangover this bad. , 

He 
tried 
opening 
one 
eye.  It 
didn't 
seem 
too 
keen 
on 

cooperating.  Try the other one.  No, that one didn't want to face the 
world either.  Very dark.  Like being wrapped up inside a big dark 
cloak or some- 

He jerked; both eyes tore open, making both smart and water. 

He was looking at some sort of big screen, in-holo'd.  Space; 
stars.  He looked down, finding it difficult to move his head.  He was 
held inside a large, very comfortable but very secure chair; it was 
made of some sort of soft hide, it was half reclined and it smelled 
very pleasant, but it had big padded hoops that had clamped 
themselves over his forearms and his lower legs.  A similar hide-
covered bar looped over his lower abdomen.  He tried moving his 
head again.  It was held inside some sort of open-face helmet which 
felt like it was attached to the headrest of the chair. 

He looked to one side.  Hide-covered wall; polished wood.  A panel or 
screen showing what looked like an abstract painting.  It was an 
abstract painting; a famous one.  He recognised it.  Ceiling black, 
light studded.  In front just the screen.  Floor carpeted.  Looked 
much like the inside of a standard Culture module so far.  Very 
quiet.  Not that that meant anything.  He looked to his right. 

There were two more seats like his across the width of the cabin - it 
was probably a cabin and this was almost certainly a nine or twelve 
person module; he couldn't see behind to tell.  The seat in the middle, 
the one nearer him, was occupied by a bulky, rather antique-looking 
drone, its flat-topped bulk resting on the cushion of the seat.  People 
always said drones looked a bit like suitcases but this one reminded 
Genar-Hofoen of an old-fashioned sledge.  Someεhow, it gave the 
impression that it was staring at the screen.  Its aura field was 
flickering as though it was undergoing rapid mood-changes; mostly 
it displayed a mixture of grey, brown and white. 

Frustration, 
displeasure 
and 
anger.  Not 
an 
encouraging 

comεbination. 

The seat on the far side of the cabin held a beautiful young woman 
who looked just a little like Dajeil Gelian.  Her nose was smaller, her 
eyes were the wrong colour, her hair was quite different.  It was hard 
to tell whether her figure bore any resemblance to the other woman 
because she was inside what looked like a jewelled space suit; a 
standard-ish Culture hard suit plated in platinum or silver and liberally 
plastered in gems that certainly glittered and flashed in the overhead 
lights as though they were things like rubies, emeralds, diamonds 
and so on.  The suit's helmet, equally encrusted, rested on the arm 
of her seat. She wasn't shackled into place in the seat, he noticed. 

The girl bore on her face a frown so deep and severe he imagined it 
would have made almost anybody else look quite supremely ugly.  On 
her it looked rather fetching.  Probably not the desired effect at 
all.  He decided to risk a smile; the open-faced helmet he was wearing 
ought to let her see it. 

'Umm, hello,' he said. 

The old drone rose and flicked round as if glancing at him.  It 
thumped back into the seat cushion, its aura fields off. 'It's hopeless,' 
it announced, as though it hadn't heard what the man had said. 
'We're locked out.  Nowhere to go.' 

The girl in the far seat narrowed her fiercely blue eyes and glared at 
Genar-Hofoen.  When she spoke, her voice was like an ice stiletto. 
'This is all your fault, you ghastly piece of shit,' she said. 

Genar-Hofoen sighed.  He was losing consciousness once more but 
he didn't care.  He had absolutely no idea who this creature was, but 
he liked her already. 

It went dark again.

I was about to call.  I just got the message from the ship I requested 
attend Pittance.  This looks bad. 

oo 

Bad?  It's a fucking catastrophe! 

oo 

Did your girl get her man? 

oo 

Oh, she got him all right, but then a few hours later the Affront High 
Command announced the birth of a bouncing baby war.  The ship 
Phage sent to Tier was standing a day's module travel away; it 
decided it had better things to do than hang around on a mission it 
had never been very happy with even from the beginning.  I think the 
declaration of war came almost as a relief to it.  It promptly 
announced its position to the Steely Glint and was immediately asked 
to ship out at maximum speed on some desperate defence 
mission.  Bastard wouldn't even tell me where.  Took me real 
milliseconds to argue it out of confessing all to the Steely Glint and 
telling it exactly why it was anywhere near Tier in the first place.  I 
was able to persuade it Phage's honour rested on it keeping quiet; I 
don't think it'll squeal.  I let it know I give serious grudge. 

oo 

But it was Demilled.  Hasn't it just gone back to Phage for 
munitioning? 

oo 

Ha!  Demilitarised 
my 
backup.  Fucker 
left 
Phage 
fully 

tooled.  Phage's own idea, sneaky scumbag.  Always was over-
protective.  What comes of being that geriatric I suppose.  Anyway, 
the Frank Exchange Of Views is cannoned to the gunwales and itching 
for a brawl, apparently.  Whatever; it has gone.  Which leaves our 
lass and the captive Genar-Hofoen floating in a module nearly a day 
out of Tier with nowhere to go.  Tier is requesting - make that 
insisting - all Culture and Affront craft and personnel leave it for the 
duration of the hostilities and nobody's being allowed in.  I've tried to 
find somebody else within range to pick them up but it's hopeless. 

A 
Tier 
deep-scan 
inventory 
has 
already 
identagged 
their 

module.  The Meatfucker is skimming in a day away and the module 
can make, oh, all of two hundred lights… Guess what happens 
next.  We've failed. 

oo 

So it would appear.  Was this the aim and is this now the result of the 
conspiracy?  War with the Affront? 

I believe so.  The Excession is still the more important matter, but its 
appearance and the possibilities it may open up have been used by 
the conspiracy to tempt the Affront into initiating hostilities.  Pittance 
is worse, though. 

That 
Pittance 
has 
fallen 
implies 
entrapment.  It 
points 
to 

treachery.  The Killing Time believes there was another Culture or ex-
Culture ship there; not one of the stored vessels but another craft, 
something no less old than the stored vessels, but wiser and more 
experienced; something that's been around as long as they, but 
awake all that time. 

It believes that this ship was taking the part of the Pittance Mind when 
it communicated with it on its approach.  I suspect it will prove to be 
a warship which apparently went Eccentric or Ulterior at some point 
in the last five hundred years and was - supposedly, not actually - 
demilitarised by one of the conspirators.  I have a list of suspects. 

The Killing Time suggests that this ship tricked its way beneath the 
Pittance Mind's guard and either destroyed it or took it over.  The 
store was then turned over to the Affront.  They now have a ready-
made instant battle fleet of Culture warcraft tech generations of 
development beyond their own ships and just nine days' journey from 
the Excession.  Nothing we can put in place in the time available can 
stop them. 

For what it's worth, the Killing Time is making all speed for 
Esperi.  Nine days from now we'll have the Not Invented Here and 
the Different Tan from the Gang there.  The NIH has two operational 
Thug class ROUs it's in the process of cannoning-up, a Hooligan LOU 
and a Delinquent GOU.  Another couple of GSVs should be there too 
if they aren't diverted because of the war, with a total of five OUs, 
two of them Torturer class.  Eight of Phage's Psychopath ROUs are 
bound for the Excession but the rest are down for defensive duties 
elsewhere to cope with likely threats from Affront battle units.  Even 

those eight won't get within punch-throwing range of the Excession 
until two days after the Affront can be there.  Bottom line is there are 
a total of ten warships of various classes capable of making it to the 
Excession in time to make a stand against the Affront; enough to hold 
off the entire Affront navy if that was all we were going to be faced 
with, but simply not capable of holding back more than an eighth of 
the ships that could come out of Pittance.  If they all go straight to 
the Excession, it will be theirs. 

For 
the 
record, all the 
remaining 
ship 
stores 
are 
breaking 

themεselves open, but the nearest is over five weeks' travel away.  A 
gesture, that's all. 

Oh, and a few other Involveds have offered help but they're all either 
too weak or too far away.  A couple of other barbarics are probably 
going to declare for the Affront once they've stopped scratching their 
heads and worked out what they might be able to get up to with the 
Culture's attention diverted, but they're even less relevant. 

And if we were expecting some well-disposed Elders to step into the 
nursery and confiscate all our toys and restore order, it doesn't look 
very likely so far; no notice taken, as far as anybody can tell. 

oo 

So.  That just leaves our old friend, currently - possibly, probεably, 
almost certainly - also en route.  Wild card?  Somehow part of the 
conspiracy?  Have we any more thoughts?  Come to that, have you 
had any reply from it? 

oo 

None, and no.  No offence, but the SS is one of the more 
unfathomεable Eccentrics.  Perhaps it thinks the Excession requires 
Storing, perhaps it intends to ram it at that speed, or attempt to 
plunge into it and access other universes… I don't know.  There is 
some private issue being played out in this, I believe, and Genar-
Hofoen fits in somewhere.  I have almost given up thinking about this 
aspect of affairs.  I shall continue my attempts to contact it but I don't 

think it's even looking at its signal files.  The point is that the war 
itself takes precedence, with the Excession prioritised beyond that. 

No offence taken.  So we are left with the Affront on the cusp of 
apotheosis or nemesis. 

Indeed.  Quite how they intend to use these elderly but still potent 
warships to take control of the Excession one can only hazard at; 
perhaps they intend surrounding it and charging admission… But they 
have begun a war which - unless they can somehow gain control of 
the Excession and exploit it - they can only lose.  They have a few 
hundred half-millennium-old warships; capable of inflicting untold 
damage let loose in a peaceable, un-militarised if relatively un-
populated section of the galaxy, certainly, but only for a month or 
two at most.  Then the Culture gathers the force to crush them 
utterly, and moves on to rip the Affront hegemony to shreds and 
impose 
its 
own 
peace 
upon 
it.  There 
can 
be 
no 
other 

outcome.  Unless the Excession does come into play.  Which I doubt. 

Maybe it is some sort of projection; maybe its appearance was not 
fortuitous but planned.  This looks unlikely, I know, but everything 
else about this has been so cunningly put together… Whatever; the 
argument which everybody had thought was lost at the end of the 
Idiran War is about to be won.  The agreement come to then is in the 
process of being overturned. 

I for one am not going to stand for this.  We may have failed to 
frustrate the conspiracy but it will still be possible to work towards 
the discovery of the guilty parties involved in its planning and 
implementation, both during and after the hostilities.  I intend to copy 
all my thoughts, theories, evidence, communications and all other 
relevant documentation to every trusted colleague and contact I 
possess.  If you have any intention of taking part in the course of 
action I am suggesting, I urge you to do the same and to relay this 
advice to The Anticipation Of A New Lover's Arrival. 

I intend to pursue the perpetrators of this unnecessary war for as 
long as it takes until they are brought to justice, and I am aware both 
that I will no longer be able to do so without them knowing that I am 
doing so, and that there is no better circumstance to arrange for the 
jeopardisation of a fellow Mind than in time of war, when blanket 
secrecies are imposed, warcraft of every sort are loosed, mistakes 
can be claimed to have been made, deals done, mercenaries hired 
and old scores settled. 

I do not believe I am being melodramatic in this.  I will be under 
terminal threat and so will anybody else who determines to adopt the 
same course as I.  The conspirators have played exceedingly dirty 
until this point and I cannot imagine they will do other than continue 
to do so now that their filthy scheme is on the very brink of success. 

What do you say?  Will you join in this perilous mission? 

oo 

How I wish that I could persuade myself, never mind you, that you 
are being melodramatic. 

You risk more than I.  My Eccentricity might save me.  We have gone 
this far together.  Count me in. 

Oh, meat, they never said this would happen when they invited me 
onto the Group and into the Gang… 

Hmm.  I had forgotten how unpleasant the emotion of fear is.  This 
is hateful!  You're right.  Let's get these bastards.  How dare they 
disturb my peace of mind so just to teach some tentacled bunch of 
backwoods barbarians a lesson! 

V 

The battle-cruiser Kiss The Blade caught the cruise ship Just 
Passεing Through on the outskirts of the Ekro system.  The Culture 
craft - ten-kilometres of sleek beauty host to two hundred thousand 
holidaying travellers of umpteen different species-types - hove to as 
soon as the battle-cruiser came within range but the Affronter vessel 

announcement about the war anyway, and thought the missile 
warhead's detonation which lit up the skies ahead of the ship was just 
some particularly big but otherwise unimpressive firework. 

It had been close.  Another hour's warning and the Culture ship's 
hurried reconfiguring and matter-scavenging engine-rebuild would 
have ensured its escape.  But it wasn't to be. 

The two ships joined.  In the reception vestibule, a small party of 
people met a trio of suited Affronters as they emerged from the 
airlocks in a swirl of cool mists. 

'You are the ship's representative?' 

'Yes,' the squat figure at the front of the humans said. 'And you?' 

'I am Colonel Alien-Befriender (first class) Fivetide Humidyear VII of 
the Winterhunter tribe and the battle-cruiser Kiss The Blade. This 
ship is claimed as prize in the name of the Affront Republic according 
to the normal rules of war.  If you obey all our instructions promptly, 
there is every possibility that no harm will come to you, your 
passengers or crew.  In case you have any illusions concerning your 
status, you are now our hostages.  Any questions?' 

'None that I either can't guess the answer to or imagine you'd answer 
truthfully,' the avatar said. 'Your jurisdiction is accepted under force 
of arms alone.  Your actions while this situation persists will be 
recorded.  Nothing less than the total destruction of this vessel atom 
by atom will wipe out that record, and when in due course-' 

'Yes, yes.  I'll contact my lawyers now.  Now take me to your best 
suite fitted out for Affront physiology.' 

the Peace faction,' she protested for the fifth or sixth time. 'We're… 
we're like the true Culture, the way it used to be…' 

'Ah,' Leffid said, grimacing as somebody pushed behind him and 
forced his chest into the front of the bar.  He glanced round, scowling, 
and ruffled his wings back into shape.  The Starboard lounge of 
the Xoanon was crowded - the ship was crowded - and he could see 
his wings were going to end up in a terrible shape by the time this 
was over.  Mind you, there were compensations; somebody pushed 
into the bar and squeezed the Peace faction girl closer to him, so that 
her bare arm touched him and he could feel the warmth of her hip 
against his.  She smelled wonderful. 'Now that could be your 
problem,' he said, trying to sound sympathetic. 'Calling yourselves 
the true Culture, you see?  To the Tier Sintricates, and even to the 
Affront, that could sound, well confusing.' 

'But everybody knows we won't have anything to do with war.  It's 
just so unfair? She flicked her short black hair and stared into the 
drug bowl she held.  It was fuming too. 'Fucking war!' She sounded 
close to tears. 

Leffid judged the time right to put his arm round her.  She didn't 
seem to mind.  He thought the better of hinting that in his own small 
way he might have helped start the war.  Sort of thing some people 
might be impressed with, but not all. 

Besides, he'd given his word, and the Tendency had been rewarded 
for its tip-off to the Mainland with this very ship, currently engaged 
in the highly humanitarian task of helping to evacuate Tier habitat of 
all Temporarily Undesirable Aliens, not to mention earning the 
Tendency some much-needed cordiality credit with a whole raft of 
other Involveds and strands of the Culture.  The girl sighed deeply 
and held the drug bowl to her face, letting some of the heavy grey 
smoke tip towards her exceedingly pretty little nose.  She glanced 
round at him with a small brave smile, her gaze rising over his 
shoulder. 

'Like your wings,' she said. 

He smiled. 'Why, thank you…' (Damn!) '… ah, my dear.' 

'I beg your pardon?' she said.  She wasn't sure she'd heard right. 

'Phoese Cloathel-Beldrunsa Khoriem lei Poere da'Merire, you have 
been deemed the senior human representative on the Orbital named 
Cloathel.  You are hereby informed that this Orbital is claimed in the 
name of the Affront Republic.  All Culture personnel are now Affront 
citizens (third class).  All orders from superiors will be obeyed.  Any 
resistance will be treated as treason.' 

The professor rubbed her eyes. 

'Cloudsheen, 
is 
that 
you?' 
she 
asked 
the 
Affronter.  The 

destroyer Wingclipper had arrived the day before with a cultural 
exchange group the university had been expecting for some 
weeks.  Cloudsheen was the ship's captain; they'd had a good talk 
about 
pan-species 
semantics 
at 
the 
party 
just 
the 
night 

before.  Intelligent, surprisingly sensitive creature; not remotely as 
aggressive 
as 
she'd 
expected.  This 
looked 
like 
him, 
but 

different.  She had a disquieting feeling the extra bits on his suit were 
weapons. 

'Captain Cloudsheen, if you please, professor,' the Affronter said, 
floating closer.  It was directly above her skirt, lying crumpled on the 
floor.  Heavens, she had been messy last night. 

'Are you serious?' she asked.  She had a strong urge to fart but she 
held it in; she was oddly concerned that the Affronter would think she 
was being insulting. 

'I am perfectly serious, professor.  The Affront and the Culture are 
now at war.' 

'Oh,' she said.  She glanced over at her terminal brooch, lying on an 
extension of the bed's headboard.  Well, the Newsflash light was 
winking, right enough; practically strobing in fact; must be urgent 
indeed.  She thought. 'Shouldn't you be addressing this to the Hub?' 

'It refuses to communicate,' the Affronter officer said. 'We have 
surrounded it.  You have been deemed most senior Culture - ex-
Culture, I should say - representative in its place.  This is not a joke, 
professor, I'm sorry to say.  The Orbital has been mined with AM 
warheads.  If it proves necessary, your world will be destroyed.  The 
full cooperation of yourself and everybody else on the Orbital will help 
ensure this does not happen.' 

'Well, I don't accept this honour, Cloudsheen.  I-' 

The Affronter had turned and was floating back towards the windows 
again.  It swivelled in the air as it retreated. 'You don't have to,' it 
said. 'As I said, you have been deemed.' 

'Well then,' she said, 'I deem you to be acting without any authority 
I care to recognise and-' 

The Affronter darted through the air towards her and stopped directly 
above the bed, making her flinch despite herself.  She smelled… 
something cold and toxic. 'Professor,' Cloudsheen said. 'This is not an 
academic debate or some common room word-game.  You are 
prisoners and hostages and all your lives are forfeit.  The sooner you 
understand the realities of the situation, the better.  I know as well 
as you that you are in no way in charge of the Orbital, but certain 
formalities have to be observed, regardless of their practical 
irrelevance.  I consider that duty has now been discharged and 
frankly that's all that matters, because I have the AM warheads; and 
you don't.' It drew quickly away, sucking a cool breeze behind it.  It 
stopped just before the windows again. 'Lastly,' it said, 'I am sorry to 
have disturbed you.  I thank you personally and on behalf of my crew 
for the reception party.  It was most enjoyable.' 

He left.  The curtains soughed in and out, slowly golden. 

Her heart, she was surprised to discover, was pounding. 

Part of the Attitude Adjuster felt sick.  It knew it was doing the right 
thing, in the end, but at a simple, surface level it felt disgust at the 
deception it was having to foist upon its fellow ships.  It tried to tell 
itself that it would all end with little or no blood spilled and few or no 
Mind-deaths, but it knew that there was no guarantee.  It had spent 
years thinking all this through, shortly after the proposition had been 
put to it seventy years earlier, and had known then, accepted then 
that it might come to this, but it had always hoped it would not.  Now 
the moment was at hand it was starting to wonder if it had made a 
mistake, but knew it was too late to turn back now.  Better to believe 
that it had been right then and now it was merely being short-sighted 
and squeamish. 

It could not be wrong.  It was not wrong.  It had had an open mind 
and it had become convinced of the rightness of the course which was 
being suggested and in which it would play such an important part.  It 
had done as it had been asked to do; it had watched the Affront, 
studied them, immersed itself in their history, culture and 
beliefs.  And in all that time it had achieved a kind of sympathy for 
them, an empathy, even, and at the start perhaps a degree of 
admiration for them, but it had also built up a cold and terrible hatred 
of their ways. 

In the end, it thought it understood them because it was just a little 
like them. 

It was a warship, after all.  It was built, designed to glory in 
destruction, when it was considered appropriate.  It found, as it was 
rightly and properly supposed to, an awful beauty in both the 
weaponry of war and the violence and devastation which that 
weaponry was capable of inflicting, and yet it knew that 
attractiveness stemmed from a kind of insecurity, a sort of 
childishness.  It could see that - by some criteria - a warship, just by 
the perfectly articulated purity of its purpose, was the most beautiful 
single artifact the Culture was capable of producing, and at the same 
time understand the paucity of moral vision such a judgement 
implied.  To fully appreciate the beauty of a weapon was to admit to 
a kind of shortsightedness close to blindness, to confess to a sort of 
stupidity.  The weapon was not itself; nothing was solely itself.  The 
weapon, like anything else, could only finally be judged by the effect 
it had on others, by the consequences it produced in some outside 
context, by its place in the rest of the universe.  By this measure the 
love, or just the appreciation, of weapons was a kind of tragedy. 

The Attitude Adjuster thought it could see into the souls of the 
Affronters.  They were not the happy-go-lucky life-and-soul-of-the-
party grand fellows with a few bad habits they were commonly 
thought to be; they were not thoughtlessly cruel in the course of 
seeking to indulge other more benign and even admirable pleasures; 
they were not merely terrible rascals. 

They gloried, first and foremost, in their cruelty.  Their cruelty was 
the point.  They were not thoughtless.  They knew they hurt their 
own kind and others and they revelled in it; it was their purpose.  The 
rest - the robust joviality, the blokish vivacity -was part happy 
accident, part cunningly exaggerated ploy, the equivalent of an 
angelic-looking child discovering that a glowing smile will melt the 
severest adult heart and excuse almost any act, however dreadful. 

It had agreed to the plan now coming to fruition with a heavy 
soul.  People would die, Minds be destroyed because of what it was 
doing.  The 
ghastly 
danger 
was 
gigadeathcrime.  Mass 

destruction.  Utter horror.  The Attitude Adjuster had lied, it had 
deceived, it had acted - by what it knew would be the consensual 
opinion of all but a few of its peers - with massive dishonour.  It was 

all too well aware its name might live for millennia hence as that of a 
traitor, as an abhorrence, an abomination. 

Still, it would do what it had become convinced had to be done, 
because to do otherwise would be to wish an even worse self-hatred 
upon itself, the ultimate abomination of disgust at oneself. 

Perhaps, it told itself as it brought another slumbering warcraft to 
wakefulness, the Excession would make everything all right.  The 
half-thought was already ironic, but it continued with it anyway.  Yes; 
maybe the Excession was the solution.  Maybe it really was worth all 
that was being risked in its name, and capable of bringing placid 
resolution.  That would be sweet; the excuse takes over, the casus 
belli brings peace… Like fuck, it thought.  The ship sneered at itself, 
examining the idiotic thought and then discarding it with probably 
less contempt than it deserved. 

It was, anyway, too late to reconsider now.  Too much had been done 
already.  The Pittance Mind was already dead, choosing self-
destruction rather than compromise; the human who had been the 
only other conscious sentience in the rock had been killed, and the 
de-stored ships would speed, utterly deceived, to what could well 
prove to be their doom; the future alone knew who or what else they 
would take with them.  The war had begun and all the Attitude 
Adjuster could do was play out the part it had agreed to play. 

Another warship Mind surfaced to wakefulness.

our Affront allies if I should be lost.  Confirmatory messages from the 
GSV No Fixed Abode, the GCU Different Tan and the MSV Not 
Invented Here attached… 

The craft had a romantic, even sentimental streak which Genar-
Hofoen had rarely glimpsed in all the two years they had spent 
together on God'shole habitat (and which, indeed, it had 
delibεerately kept hidden for fear of his ridicule), and it saw itself 
now as being like the castellan of some small fortified embassy in a 
teeming barbarian city, far from the civilised lands that were his 
home; a wise, thoughtful man, technically a warrior, but more of a 
thinker, one who saw much more of the realities behind the 
embassy's mission than those in his charge, and who had devoutly 
hoped that his warrior skills would never be called upon.  Well, that 
time had come; the native soldiers were hammering at the 
compound's gates right now and it was only a matter of time before 
the embassy compound fell.  There was treasure in the embassy and 
the barbarians would not rest until they had it. 

The castellan left the parapet where he had looked out upon the 
besieging forces and retreated to his private chamber.  His few troops 
were already putting up the best defence they could; nothing he could 
do or say would do other than hinder them now.  His few spies had 
been dispatched some time ago through secret passageways into the 
city, to do what damage they could once the embassy itself was 
destroyed, as it surely must be.  There was nothing else which 
awaited his attention.  Save this one decision. 

He had already opened the safe and taken out the sealed orders; the 
paper was in his hand.  He read it again.  So it was to be 
destruction.  He had guessed as much, but it was still a shock 
somehow. 

It should not have come to this, but it had.  He had known the risks, 
they had been pointed out at the beginning, when he had taken up 
this position, but he had not really imagined for a moment that he 
would really be faced with either utter dishonour and the vicarious 
treachery of forced collaboration, or death at his own hand. 

There was, of course, no real choice.  Call it his upbringing.  He 
looked ruefully around the small private chamber that held the 
memories of home, his library, his clothes and keepsakes.  This was 
him.  This was who he was.  The same beliefs and principles that had 
led him here to this lonely outpost required that there was no choice 

over surrender or death.  But there was still one choice to make, and 
it was a bitter one to be given. 

He could destroy the embassy - and himself with it, of course - 
completely, so that all that would be left to the barbarians would be 
its stones.  Or he could take the entire city with him.  It was not just 
a city; in one sense it was not even principally a city; it was a vast 
arsenal, a crowded barracks and a busy naval port; altogether an 
important component of the barbarians' war effort.  Its destruction 
would benefit the side that the castellan was loyal to, the cause that 
he absolutely believed in; arguably it would save lives in the long 
run.  Yet the city had its civilians too; the out-numbering innocents 
that were the women and children and the subjugated underclasses, 
not to mention the blameless others from neutral lands who just 
happened to find themselves caught up in the war through no fault 
of their own.  Had he a right to snuff them out too by destroying the 
city? 

He put the piece of paper down.  He looked at his reflection in a 
distant looking glass. 

Death.  In all this choice there was no doubt about his own fate, only 
about how he would be remembered.  As humanitarian, or 
weakling?  As mass-murderer, or hero? 

Death.  How strange to contemplate it now. 

He had always wondered how he would face it.  There was a certain 
continued existence, of course.  He had faith in that; the assurances 
of the priests that his soul was recorded in a great book, somewhere, 
and capable of resurrection.  But the precise he he was right now; 
that would assuredly end, and soon; that was over. 

Death, he remembered somebody saying once, was a kind of 
victory.  To have lived a long good life, a life of prodigious pleasure 
and minimal misery, and then to die; that was to have won.  To 
attempt to hang on for ever risked ending up in some as yet 
unglimpsed horror-future.  What if you lived for ever and all that had 
gone before, however terrible things had sometimes appeared to be 
in the past, however badly people had behaved to each other 

throughout history, was nothing compared to what was yet to 
come?  Suppose in the great book of days that told the story of 
everything, all the gone, done past was merely a bright, happy 
introduction compared to the main body of the work, an unending 
tale of unbearable pain scraped in blood on a parchment of living 
skin? 

Better to die than risk that. 

Live well and then die, so that the you that is you now can never be 
again, and only tricks can re-create something that might think it is 
you, but is not. 

The outer gates fell; he heard them go.  The castellan stood up and 
went to the casement.  In the courtyard, the barbarian soldiers 
flowed through to the last line of defence. 

Soon.  The choice, the choice.  He could spin a coin, but that would 
be… cheap.  Unworthy. 

He walked to the device that would destroy the embassy compound, 
and the city too, if he chose. 

There was no choice here, either.  Not really. 

There would be peace again.  The only question was when. 

He could not know if ultimately more people would suffer and die 
because he was choosing not to destroy the city, but at least this way 
the damage and the casualties would be confined to the minimum for 
the longest possible time.  And if in the future he would be judged to 
have done the wrong thing and to have made the incorrect decision… 
well, death had the other advantage that he would not be present to 
suffer that knowledge of that judgement. 

He double-checked that the device was set so that only the embassy 
would be destroyed, he waited a moment longer to be sure that he 
was calm and clear about what he was doing, then as the tears came 
to his eyes, he activated the device. 

The module Scopell-Afranqui self-destructed in a blink of annihilatory 
energies centred on its AI core, obliterating it entirely; the module 
itself was blasted into a million pieces.  The explosion sent a shiver 
through the fabric of God'shole habitat that was felt all the way round 
that great wheel; it took out a significant section of the surrounding 
inner docks area and caused a rupture in the skin of the engineering 
compartment beneath; this was quickly repaired. 

The destroyer Riptalon was damaged and would require a further 
week in dock, though there were no fatalities or serious injuries on 
board.  The explosion killed five officers and a few dozen soldiers and 
technicians in the docks and smaller craft alongside the module; a 
number of semi-aware AI entities were also lost and their cores later 
found to be corrupted by agent entities the module had succeeded in 
infiltrating into the habitat's systems shortly before its destruction, 
despite every precaution.  These, or their descendants, continued to 
significantly reduce the habitat's contribution to the war effort for the 
duration of hostilities. 

~ Scary, when you have every reason to believe you may be sitting 
next to the real reason it was declared. 

The GCU Fate Amenable To Change floated in a triangular pattern 
with 
the 
two 
Elencher 
vessels Sober 
Counsel and Appeal To 

Reason. The two Elench ships had repeatedly attempted to 
communicate 
with 
the 
Excession, 
entirely 
without 

success.  The Fate was getting nervous, just waiting for the pressure 
building up with the crews of the two Elencher ships for more intrusive 
action to overcome the reticence of the craft themselves. 

The three craft had secretly declared their own little pact over the last 
few days after the second Elencher ship had appeared on the 
scene.  They had exchanged drone and human avatars, opened up 
volumes of their mind-sets they would not normally have exposed to 
craft of another society, and pledged not to act without consulting the 

others.  That agreeable agreement would lapse if the Elenchers chose 
to try to interfere with the Excession.  It would have to lapse to some 
extent anyway in a couple of days when the MSV Not Invented 
Here arrived and - the Fate suspected - started bossing everybody 
about, but it was trying desperately to dissuade the two Elencher 
ships from doing anything rash in the meantime. 

~ Are there any Affront warships known to be anywhere in this 
volume? the Appeal To Reason asked. 

~ No, the Fate Amenable To Change replied. ~ In fact they've been 
staying away and telling everybody else to do so as well.  I suppose 
we should have guessed that was suspicious in itself.  That's the 
trouble with people like them I suppose; whenever you think you're 
detecting the first signs of them starting to behave responsibly it's 
just them being even more devious and underhand than usual. 

~ You think they want the Excession? the Sober Counsel asked. 

~ It's possible. 

~ Perhaps they're not coming here, suggested the Appeal To 
Reason. ~ Aren't they attacking the whole Culture?  There are 
reports of scores of ships and Orbitals being taken… 

~ I don't know, the Fate admitted.  It looks like madness to me; they 
can't defeat the whole Culture. 

~ But they're saying a ship-store at this rock Pittance has fallen, 
the Sober Counsel sent. 

~ Well, yes.  Officially there's still a blackout on that, but (off record, 
of course), if they are coming in this direction I wouldn't want to be 
here in about a week's time. 

~ So if we're going to get through to the entity, we'd better do it 
soon, the Appeal To Reason sent. 

~ Oh, don't start on about that again; you said yourself they might 
not be coming… the Fate began, then broke off. ~ Hold on.  Are you 
getting this?

~ It's not centred on the entity itself, the other Elench ship pointed

Right.  I have thought about this.  No, I will not help in trapping 
the Serious Callers Only or the Shoot Them Later. I reported my 
previous misgivings and the fact that I had shared them with the 
other two craft because in the course of my investigations into what 
I perceived as a dangerous conspiracy I became convinced of the 
need to deal decisively with the Affront.  I still do not approve of the 
way this has been done, but by the time your plans became 
uncovered it would arguably have caused more damage attempting 
to arrest them than letting them go ahead.  I still find it nard to 
believe tnat the rogue ship which tricked the ship store at Pittance 
was acting alone and that you merely took advantage of the ruse, 
despite your assurances.  However, I have no evidence to the 
contrary.  I have given my word and I will not go public with all this, 
but I will consider that agreement dependent on the continued well-
being and freedom from persecution of both the Serious Callers 
Only and the Shoot Them Later, as well, of course, as being 
contingent upon my own continued integrity.  I don't doubt you will 
think me either paranoid or ridiculous for systematising this 
arrangement with various other friends and colleagues, particularly 
given the hostilities which commenced yesterday.  I am thinking of 
taking some sabbatical time myself soon, and going off course-
schedule.  I shall, in any event, be quitting the Group.

I understand completely.  There is, you must, must believe, no desire 
on our part to cause any harm to you or the two craft you

of this unfortunate state of affairs; there will be no recriminations, no

Let me add that it is hard for me to find the words to commuεnicate

shown irreproachable moral integrity combined with a truly objective 

open-mindedness; virtues that all too often are regarded as being as 
tragically incompatible as they are infinitely desirable.  You are an 
example to all of us.  I beg you not to leave the Group.  We would 
lose too much.  Please; reconsider.  No one would deny that you have 
earned a thousand rests, but please take pity on those who would 
dare ask you to forgo one, for their own selfish benefit.

Thank you.  However, my decision is irrevocable.  Should I still be 
welcome, I may hope for a request to rejoin you at some point in the 
future should some exceptional situation stimulate the thought that I 
might again be of service.

fondest regards, so long as you swear never to forget that your 
invitation to restore your wisdom and probity to our small team 
stands in perpetuity! 

VI 

Genar-Hofoen spent quite a lot of time on the toilet.  Ulver Seich was 
hell when she was cross and she had been in a state of virtually 
permanent crossness ever since he'd properly woken up; in fact, since 
well before.  She'd been cross - cross with him - while he'd been 
unconscious, which seemed unfair somehow. 

If he slept too long or day-dozed she got even crosser, so he went to 
the toilet for fairly long intervals.  The toilet in a nine-person module 
consisted of a sort of thick flap that hinged down from a recess in the 
back wall of the small craft's single cabin.  A semi-cylindrical field 
popped into being when the flap was in place, isolating the enclosed 
space from the rest of the cabin, and there was just enough room to 
make the necessary adjustments to one's clothing and stand or sit in 
comfort; usually some pleasantly bland music played, but Genar-
Hofoen preferred the perfect silence the field enclosure produced.  He 
sat there in the gentle, pleasantly perfumed downward breeze, not, 

Stuck on a tiny but perfectly comfortable module with a beautiful, 
intelligent young woman.  It ought to be a recipe for unbridled bliss; 
it was practically a fantasy.  In fact, it was sheer hell.  He'd felt 
trapped before, but never like this, never so completely, never so 
helplessly, never with somebody who seemed to find him quite so 
annoying just to be in the presence of.  He couldn't even blame the 
drone.  The drone was, in a sense, in the way, but he didn't 
mind.  Just as well it was, in fact; he didn't know what Ulver Seich 
might have done to him if it hadn't been in the way.  Hell, he 
quite liked the drone.  The girl he could easily fall in love with, and in 
the right circumstances certainly admire and be impressed by and, 
yes, perfectly possibly like, even be friends with… but right now he 
didn't like her any more than she liked him, and she really didn't like 
him a lot. 

He supposed these just were not the right circumstances.  The right 
circumstances would involve them both being somewhere extremely 
civilised and cultured with lots of other people around and things 
happening and stuff to do and opportunities to choose when and 
where to get to know each other, not cooped up - grief, and it was 
only for two days so far but it felt more like a month - in a small 
module in the middle of a war with no apparent idea where they were 
supposed to go and all their plans seemingly thwarted.  It probably 
didn't help that he was effectively their prisoner, either. 

'So who was the first girl?' he asked her. 'The one outside the 
Sublimers' place?' 

'Probably SC,' Ulver Seich told him grumpily.  She glared back at the 
drone.  The two humans were in the same seats they'd been in when 
he'd first woken up.  The floor of the cabin area behind them could 
contort and produce various combinations of seats, couches, tables 
and so on, but every now and again they just sat in the forward-
facing seats, looking at the screen and the stars.  The drone Churt 
Lyne sat oblivious on the floor of the cabin, taking no apparent notice 
of the girl's glare.  The drone seemed to be glare-proof.  Somehow it 
was allowed to get away with being uncommunicative. 

Genar-Hofoen sat back in the seat.  The stars ahead looked the same 
as they had a few minutes ago.  The module wasn't really heading 
anywhere purposefully; it was just moving away from Tier, down one 
of the many corridors approved by Tier traffic control as free from 
warships and/or volume warnings or restrictions.  The girl and the 
drone hadn't allowed him to contact Tier or anybody else.  They had 
been in touch with what sounded like a ship Mind, communicating by 
screen-written messages he wasn't allowed to see.  Once or twice the 
girl and the drone had gone quiet and still together, obviously in touch 
through its communicator and a neural lace. 

In theory he might have been able to wrest control of the module 
from them at such a point, but in practice it would have been futile; 
the module had its own semi-sentient systems which he had no way 
of subverting and little chance of arguing round even if he had 
somehow got the better of the girl and the drone, and anyway, where 
was he supposed to go?  Tier was out, he had no idea where the Grey 
Area or the Sleeper Service were and suspected that probably 
nobody else knew where the two ships were either.  He assumed SC 
would be looking for him.  Better to let himself be found. 

Besides, when they'd finally released him from the chair he'd been 
secured to while he'd been unconscious, the drone had shown him an 
old but shinily mean-looking knife missile it contained within its 
casing and given him a brief but nasty stinging sensation in his left 
little finger that it assured him was about a thousandth of the pain its 
effector was capable of inflicting on him if he tried anything silly.  He 
had assured the machine that he was no warrior and that any martial 
skills he might have been born with had entirely atrophied at the 
expense of an overdeveloped sense of self-preservation. 

So he was content to let them get on with it when they 
communiεcated silently.  Made a welcome change, in fact.  Anyway, 
whatever it was they had discovered through all this communicating, 
they didn't seem terribly happy with it.  The girl in particular seemed 
upset.  He got the impression she felt cheated, that she'd discovered 
she'd been lied to.  Perhaps because of that she was telling him things 
she wouldn't have told him otherwise.  He tried to put together what 

she'd just said about Special Circumstances with what she'd already 
let him know. 

His head ached briefly with the effort.  He'd hit it when he'd fallen out 
of the trap, in Night City.  He was still trying to work out what 
happened there. 

'But I thought you said you were with SC?' he said.  He couldn't help 
it; he knew it would just annoy her again, but he was still confused. 

'I said,' she hissed, through gritted teeth, 'that I thought I was 
working for SC.' She looked to one side and sighed heavily, then 
turned back to him. 'Maybe I am, maybe I was, maybe there's 
different bits of SC, maybe something else entirely, I just don't know, 
don't you understand?' 

'So who sent you?' he asked, crossing his arms.  The ownskin jacket 
slid round his torso; the module's bio unit was cleaning his shirt.  The 
suit still looked pretty good, he thought.  The girl hadn't changed out 
of her jewelled space suit (though she had used the module's toilet, 
rather than whatever built-in units the suit had).  She looked less and 
less like Dajeil Gelian every hour, he thought, her face becoming 
younger and finer and more beautiful all the time.  It was a 
fascinating transformation to watch and if the circumstances had 
been different he'd have been aching at least to test the waters with 
her to see if there was any sort of mutuality of attraction here… but 
the circumstances were as they were, and right now the last thing he 
wanted to do was give her any impression he was ogling her. 

'I told you who sent me,' she said, her voice cold. 'A Mind.  With the 
help… well, it looks more like collusion now, actually,' she said with 
an insincere smile, 'of my home world's Mind.' She took a deep 
breath, then set her lips in as tight a line as their fullness would 
permit. 'I had my own warship for grief's sake,' she said bitterly, 
addressing the stars on the screen ahead of them. 'Is it any wonder 
I thought it was all SC-arranged?' 

She glanced back at the silent drone, then looked at him again. 

'Now we're told our ship's fucked off and we've to keep quiet about 
where we are.  And the sort of trouble we had getting you off Tier…' 
She shook her head. 'Looked like SC to me… not that I know that 
much, but the machine thinks so too,' she said, jerking her head to 
indicate the drone again.  She looked him down and up. 'Wish we'd 
left you there now.' 

'Well, so do I,' he said, trying to sound reasonable. 

She'd got to Tier a few days before him, sent to look for him, in effect 
given a blank cheque and yet not able to find out where he was the 
easy way, through just asking; hence the business with the 
pondrosaur.  Which made sense if it wasn't Special Circumstances 
which had sent her, because it was SC who had been looking after 
him on Tier, and why would they be trying to kidnap him from 
themselves?  And yet she'd had her own warship, apparently, and 
been given the intelligence that had led her to Tier to intercept him 
in the first place; information SC would naturally restrict to a small 
number of trusted Minds.  Mystifying. 

'So,' she said. 'What exactly were you supposed to be doing after you 
left Tier, or was this rather pathetic attempt to reclaim your lost youth 
by trying to seduce women who looked like an old flame the totality 
of your mission?' 

He smiled as tolerantly as he could. 'Sorry,' he said. 'I can't tell you.' 

Her eyes narrowed further. 'You know,' she said, 'they might just ask 
us to throw you outboard.' 

He allowed himself to sit back, looking surprised and hurt.  A little 
shiver of real fear did make itself felt in his guts. 'You wouldn't, would 
you?' he asked. 

She looked forward at the stars again, eyebrows gathered, mouth set 
in a down-turned line. 'No,' she admitted, 'but I'd enjoy thinking 
about it.' 

There was silence for a while.  He was conscious of her breathing, 
though he looked in vain at the attractively sculpted chest of her suit 

for any sign of movement.  Suddenly, her foot clunked down on the 
carpet beneath her jewel-encrusted boot. 'What were you supposed 
to be doing?' she demanded angrily, turning to face him. 
'Why did they want you?  Fuck it, I've told you why I was 
there.  Come on; tell me.' 

'I'm sorry,' he sighed.  She was already starting to blush with 
anger.  Oh no, here we go, he thought.  Tantrum time again. 

Then the drone jerked up into the air behind them and something 
flashed round the edges of the module's screen. 

'Hello in there,' said a large, deep voice, all around them.

Of

Arrival, 
The

I regret to inform you that I have changed my position concernεing 
the so-called conspiracy concerning the Esperi Excession and the 
Affront.  It is now my judgement that while there may have been 
certain irregularities of jurisdiction and of operational ethics involved, 
these were of an opportunistic rather than a conspiratorial 
nature.  Further, I am, as I have always been, of the opinion that 
while the niceties of normal moral constraints should be our guides, 
they must not be our masters. 

There are inevitably occasions when such - if I may characterise them 
so - civilian considerations must be set aside (and indeed, is this not 
what the very phrase and title Special Circumstances implies?) the 
better to facilitate actions which, while distasteful and regrettable 
perhaps in themselves, might reasonably be seen as reliably leading 
to some strategically desirable state or outcome no rational person 
would argue against. 

It is my profoundly held conviction that the situation regarding the 
Affront is of this highly specialised and rare nature and thereεfore 
merits the measures and policy currently being employed by the 

Minds you and I had previously suspected of indulging in some sort 
of grand conspiracy. 

I call upon you to talk with our fellows in the Interesting Times Gang 
whom you have - unjustly, I now believe - distrusted, with a view to 
facilitating an accord which will allow all parties to work together 
towards a satisfactory outcome both to this regrettable and 
unnecessary misunderstanding and, perhaps, to the conflict that has 
now been initiated by the Affront. 

For myself, I intend to go into a retreat for some time, starting 
immediately from the end of this signal.  I shall no longer be in a 
position to correspond; however, messages may be left for me with 
the Independent Retreats Council (ex-Culture section) and will be 
reviewed every hundred days (or thereabouts). 

I wish you well and hope that my decision might help precipitate a 
reconciliation I devoutly wish will happen.

Oh dear.  Now we're both really under threat.  I'm heading into the 
Homomdan Fleet Base at Ara.  I suggest you seek sanctuary as 
well.  As a precaution, I am distributing locked copies of all our 
signals, researches and suspicions to a variety of trustworthy Minds 
with instructions that they only be opened on the event of mV 
demise.  This I also urge you to do.  Our only alternative is to go 

public, and I am not convinced we have sufficient evidence of a non-
circumstantial nature. 

This is despicable.  To be on the run from our own kind, our own peer 
Minds.  Meat, am I miffed.  Personally I'm running for a nice sunny 
Orbital (DiaGlyph enclosed).  I too have deposited all the facts on this 
matter with friends, Minds specialising in archiving and the more 
reliable news services (I agree we cannot yet bruit our suspicions 
abroad; there probably never was a proper moment for that, but if 
there was, the war has negated its relevance), as well as the Sleeper 
Service, in what has become my daily attempt to contact it.  Who 
knows?  Another opportunity may present itself once the dust has 
cleared from around the Excession - if it ever does; if there is anyone 
left to witness it. 

Oh well; it's out of our fields now. 

Best of luck, like they say. 

VIII 

The avatar Amorphia moved one of its catapults forward an octagon, 
in front of the woman's leading tower; the noise of solid wooden 
wheels rumbling and squeaking along on equally solid axles, and of 
lashed-together wooden spars and planks flexing and creaking, filled 
the room.  A curious smell which might have been wood rose gently 
from the board-cube. 

Dajeil Gelian sat forward in her fabulously sculpted chair, one hand 
absently tapping her belly gently, the other at her mouth.  She 
sucked at one finger, her brows creased in concentration.  She and 
Amorphia sat in the main room of her new accommodation aboard 
the GCU Jaundiced Outlook, which had been restructured to mimic 
precisely the lay-out of the tower she had lived in for nearly forty 
years.  The big, round room, capped by its transparent dome, 
resounded - between the sound effects produced by the game-cube 
- to the noise of rain.  The surrounding screens showed recordings of 
the creatures Dajeil had studied, swum and floated with during most 

of those four decades.  All around, the woman's collected curios and 
mementoes were placed and set just where thev had been in the 
tower by its lonely sea.  In the broad grate, a log fire crackled 
exuberantly. 

Dajeil thought for a while, then took a cavalarian and shifted it across 
the board to the noise of thundering hooves and the smell of 
sweat.  It came to a halt by a baggage train undefended save for 
some irregulars. 

Amorphia, sat blackly folded on a small stool on the other side of the 
board, went very still.  Then it moved an Invisible. 

Dajeil looked round the board, trying to work out what all the avatar's 
recent Invisible moves were leading up to.  She shrugged; the 
cavalry piece took the irregulars almost without loss, to the sound of 
iron clashing on iron and screams, and the smell of blood. 

Amorphia made another Invisible move. 

Nothing happened for a moment.  Then there was an almost 
subεsonic rumbling sound.  Dajeil's tower collapsed, sinking through 
the octagon in the board in a convincing-looking cloud of dust and 
the floor-shaking sound of grinding, crunching rocks.  And more 
screams.  A lot of the important moves seemed to be accompanied 
by those.  A smell of turned-over earth and stone-dust filled the air. 

Amorphia looked up almost guiltily. 'Sappers,' it said, and shrugged. 

Dajeil cocked one eyebrow. 'Hmm,' she said.  She surveyed the new 
situation.  With the tower gone, the way lay open to her heartland.  It 
didn't look good. 'Think I should sue for peace?' she asked. 

'Shall I ask the ship?' the avatar asked. 

Dajeil sighed. 'I suppose so,' she sighed. 

The avatar glanced down at the board again.  It looked up. 'Seven-
eighths chance it would go to me,' the avatar told the woman. 

She sat back in the great chair. 'It's yours, then,' she said.  She leant 
forward briefly and picked up another tower.  She studied it.  The 
avatar sat back, looking moderately pleased with itself. 'Are you 
happy here, Dajeil?' it asked. 

'Thank you, yes,' she replied.  She returned her attention to the 
miniature tower-piece held in her fingers.  She was silent for a while, 
then said, 'So.  What is going to happen, Amorphia?  Can you tell me 
yet?' 

The avatar gazed steadily at the woman. 'We are heading very quickly 
towards the war zone,' it said in a strange, almost childish 
voice.  Then it sat forward, inspecting her closely. 'War zone?' Dajeil 
said, glancing at the board. 'There is a war,' the avatar confirmed, 
nodding.  It assumed a grim expression. 

'Why?  Where?  Between whom?' 

'Because of a thing called an excession.  Around the place where we 
are heading.  Between the Culture and the Affront.' It went on to 
explain a little of the background. 

Dajeil turned the little tower-model over and over in her hands, 
frowning at it.  Eventually she asked, 'Is this Excession thing really 
as important as everybody seems to think?' 

The avatar looked thoughtful for just a moment, then it spread its 
arms and shrugged. 'Does it really matter?' it said. 

The woman frowned again, not understanding. 'Doesn't it matter 
more than anything?' 

It shook its head. 'Some things mean too much to matter,' it said.  It 
stood up and stretched. 'Remember, Dajeil,' it told her, 'you can leave 
at any point.  This ship will do as you wish.' 

'I'll stick around for now,' she told it.  She looked briefly up at it. 
'When-?' 

'A couple of days,' it told her. 'All being well.' It stood looking down 
at her for a while, watching her turn the small tower over and over in 
her fingers.  Then it nodded and turned and quietly walked out of the 
room. 

She hardly noticed it go.  She leant forward and placed the small 
tower on an octagon towards the rear margin of the board, on a 
region of shore bordering the hem of blue that was supposed to 
represent the sea, near where, a few moves earlier, a ship-piece of 
Amorphia's had landed a small force which had established a bridge-
head.  She had never placed a tower in such a position, in all their 
games.  The board interpreted the move with the sound of screams 
once more, but this time the screams were the plaintive, plangent 
calls of sea birds calling out over the sound of heavy, pounding 
surf.  A sharply briny odour filled the air above the board cube and 
she was back there, back then, with the sound of the sea birds and 
the smell of the dashing wild sea tangled in her hair, and the growing 
child continually heavy and sporadically lively, almost violent with its 
sudden, startling kicks, in her belly. 

Waves crashed on the shingle and rocks of the shore to either side of 
her in great sighing, soughing intakings of what sounded like the 
breath of some great sea creature, a gathering, deepening sound that 
ended in the small moment of half-silence before each great wave fell 
and burst against the tumbled, growling slope of rocks and stones, 
pushing and pulling and rolling the giant glistening pebbles in 
thudding concussions of water forcing its way amongst their spaces 
while the rocks slid and smacked and cracked against each other. 

Directly in front of her, where there was a raised shelf of rock just 
under the surface of the sea, the waves breaking on the shallower 
slope in front of her were smaller, almost friendlier, and the main 
force of the grumbling, swelling ocean was met fifty metres out at a 
rough semicircle marked by a line of frothing surf. 

She clasped her hands palm up on her lap, beneath the bulge of her 
belly, and closed her eyes.  She breathed deeply, the ozone and the 
brine sharp in her nostrils, connecting her to the sea's salty 
restlessness, making her, in her mind, again part of its great fluid 
coalescing of constancy and changefulness, imbuing her thoughts 
with something of that heaving, sheltering vastness, that world-
cleaving cradle of layered, night-making depth. 

Inside her mind, in the semi-trance she now assumed, she stepped 
smilingly down through her own fluid layers of protection and 
conformation, to where her baby lay, healthy and growing, half 
awake, half asleep, wholly beautiful. 

Her own genetically altered body gently interrogated the placental 
processes protecting the joined but subtly different chemistries and 
inheritance of her child's body from her own immune system and 
carefully, fairly managing the otherwise selfishly voracious demands 
the baby made upon her body's resources of blood, sugars, proteins, 
minerals and energy. 

The temptation was always to tamper, to fiddle with the settings that 
regulated everything, as though by such meddling one proved how 
carefully painstaking and watchful one was being, but she always 
resisted, content that there were no warning signs, no notice that 
some imbalance was threatening either her health or that of the fetus 
and happy to leave the body's own systemic wisdom to prevail over 
the brain's desire to intervene. 

Shifting the focus of her concentration, she was able to use another 
designed-in sense no creature from any part of her typically 
distributed Cultural inheritance had ever possessed to look upon her 
soon-to-be child, modelling its shape in her mind from the 
information provided by a subset of specialised organisms swimming 
in the as yet unbroken water surrounding the fetus.  She saw it; 

hunched and curled in an orbed spectrum of smooth pinks, crouched 
round its umbilical link with her as though it was concentrating on its 
supply of blood, trying to increase its flow-rate or nutritional 
saturation. 

She marvelled at it, as she always did; at its bulbously headed 
beauty, at its strange air of blankly formless intensity.  She counted 
its fingers and toes, inspected the tightly closed eyelids, smiled at the 
tiny budded cleft that spoke of the cells' unprompted selection of 
congenital femaleness.  Half her, half something strange and 
foreign.  A new collection of matter and information to present to the 
universe and to which it in turn would be presented; different, 
arguably equal parts of that great ever-repetitive, ever-changing 
jurisdiction of being. 

Reassured that all was well, she left the dimly aware being to continue 
its purposeful, unthinking growth, and returned to the part of the real 
world where she was sitting on the pebbled beach and the waves fell 
loud and foaming amongst the tumbled, rumbling rocks. 

Byr was there when she opened her eyes, standing knee-deep in the 
small waves just in front of her, wet-suited, golden hair damply 
straggled in long ringlets, face dark against the display of ruddy 
sunset behind, found just in the act of taking off the suit's face-mask. 

'Evening,' she said, smiling. 

Byr nodded and splashed up out of the water, sitting down beside her 
and putting an arm round her. 'You okay?' 

She held the fingers of the hand over her shoulder. 'Both fine,' she 
said. 'And the gang?' 

Byr laughed, peeling off the suit's feet to reveal wrinkled pink-brown 
toes. 'Sk'ilip'k' has decided he likes the idea of walking on land; says 
he's ashamed his ancestors went out of the ocean and then went back 
in again as if the air was too cold.  He wants us to make him a walking 
machine.  The others think he's crazy, though there is some support 
for the idea of them all somehow going flying together.  I left them a 

couple more screens and increased some of their access to the flight 
archives.  They gave me this; for you.' 

Byr handed her something from the suit's side pouch. 

'Oh; thank you.' She put the small figurine in one palm and turned it 
over carefully with her fingers, inspecting it by the fading red light of 
the day's end.  It was beautiful, worked out of some soft stone to 
perfectly resemble their idea of what they thought a human ought to 
look like; naturally flippered feet, legs joined to the knees, body 
fatter, shoulders slender, neck thicker, head narrower, hairless.  It 
did look like her; the face, for all that it was distorted, bore a distinct 
resemblance.  Probably G'Istig'tk't's work; there was a delicacy of 
line and a certain humour about the figurine's facial expression that 
spoke to her of the old female's personality.  She held the little figure 
up in front of Byr. 'Think it looks like me?' 

'Well, you're certainly getting that fat.' 

'Oh!' she said, slapping Byr lightly on the shoulder.  She glanced 
down at her lap, reaching to pat her belly. 'I think you're starting to 
show yourself, at last,' she said. 

Byr smiled, her face still freckled with droplets of water, catching the 
dying light.  She looked down, holding Dajeil's hand, patting her 
belly. 'Na,' she said, rising to her feet.  She held out a hand to Dajeil 
and glanced round to the tower. 'You coming in or are you going to 
sit around communing with the ocean swell all evening?  We've got 
guests, remember?' 

She took a breath to say something, then held up her hand.  Byr 
helped pull her up; she felt suddenly heavy, clumsy and… 
unwieldy.  Her back hurt dully. 'Yes, let's go in, eh?' 

They turned towards the lonely tower. 

9. Unacceptable Behaviour 

I 

The Excession's links with the two regions of the energy grid just fell 
away, twin collapsing pinnacles of fluted skein fabric sinking back into 
the grid like idealised renderings of some spent explosion at 
sea.  Both layers of the grid oscillated for a few moments, again like 
some abstractly perfect liquid, then lay still.  The waves produced on 
the grid surfaces damped quickly to nothing, absorbed.  The 
Excession floated free on the skein of real space, otherwise as 
enigmatic as ever. 

There was, for a while, silence between the three watching ships. 

Eventually, the Sober Counsel asked, ~… Is that it? 

~ So it would appear, the Fate Amenable To Change replied.  It felt 
terrified, elated, disappointed, all at once.  Terrified to be in the 
presence of something that could do what it had just observed, elated 
to have witnessed it and taken the measurements it had - there were 
data here, in the velocity of the skein-grid collapse, in the apparent 
viscosity of the grid's reaction to the links' decoupling - that would 
fuel genuinely, utterly original science - and disappointed because it 
had a sneaking feeling that that was it.  The Excession was going to 
sit here like this for a while, still doing nothing.  Seemingly endless 
boredom, instants of blinding terror… endless boredom again.  With 
the Excession around you didn't need a war. 

The Fate Amenable To Change started relaying all the data it had 
collected on the grid-skein links' collapse to a variety of other ships, 
without even collating it properly first.  Get it out of this one location 
first, just in case.  Another part of its Mind was thinking about it, 
though. 

~ That thing reacted, it told the other two craft. 

~ To the Affront signal? the Appeal To Reason sent. ~ I was 
wondering about that. 

~ Could this be the state in which the Peace Makes Plenty discovered 
the entity? the Sober Counsel asked. 

~ It could indeed, couldn't it? the Fate Amenable To Change agreed. 

~ The time has come, the Appeal To Reason sent. ~ I'm sending in a 
drone. 

~ No!  You wait until the Excession assumes the configuration it 
probably possessed when it overpowered your comrade and then you 
decide to approach it just as it must have?  Are you quite mad? 

~ We cannot just sit here any longer! the Appeal To Reason told the 
Culture craft. ~ The war is days away from us.  We have tried every 
form of communication known to life and had nothing in return!  We 
must do more!  Launching drone in two seconds.  Do not attempt to 
interfere with it! 

II 

'Well, we were going to have them at the same time; it seemed… I 
don't know; more romantic, I suppose, more symmetrical.' Dajeil 
laughed lightly, and stroked Byr's arm.  They were in the big circular 
room at the top of the tower; Kran, Aist and Tulyi, and her and 
Byr.  She stood by the log fire, with Byr.  She looked to see if Byr 
wanted to take up the story, but she just smiled and drank from her 
wine goblet. 'But then when we thought about it,' Dajeil continued, 
'it did kind of seem a bit crazy.  Two brand new babies, and just the 
two of us here to look after them, and first-time mothers.' 

'Only-time mothers,' Byr muttered, making a face into her 
goblet.  The others laughed. 

Dajeil stroked Byr's arm again. 'Well, however it turns out, we'll 
see.  But you see this way we can have… whatever time in between 
Ren being born and our other child.' She looked at Byr, smiling 
warmly. 'We haven't decided on the other name yet.  Anyway,' she 
went on, 'doing it this way will give me time to recover and get the 
two of us used to coping with a baby, before Byr has his… well, hers,' 
she said laughing, and put her arm round her partner's shoulder. 

'Yes,' Byr said, glancing at her. 'We can practise on yours and then 
get it right with mine.' 

The term used for what Dajeil and Byr were doing was Mutualling.  It 
was one of the things you could do when you were able - as virtually 
every human in the Culture had been able to do for many millennia - 
to change sex.  It took anything up to a year to alter yourself from a 
female to a male, or vice-versa.  The process was painless and set in 
action simply by thinking about it; you went into the sort of trance-
like state Dajeil had accessed earlier that evening when she had 
looked within herself to check on the state of her fetus.  If you looked 
in the right place in your mind, there was an image of yourself as you 
were now.  A little thought would make the image change from your 
present gender to the opposite sex.  You came out of the trance, and 
that was it.  Your body would already be starting to change, glands 
sending out the relevant viral and hormonal signals which would start 
the gradual process of conversion. 

Within a year a woman who had been capable of carrying a child - 
who, indeed, might have been a mother - would be a man fully 
capable of fathering a child.  Most people in the Culture changed sex 
at some point in their lives, though not all had children while they 
were female.  Generally people eventually changed back to their 
congenital sex, but not always, and some people cycled back and 
forth between male and female all their lives, while some settled for 
an androgynous in-between state, finding there a comfortable 
equanimity. 

Long-term relationships in a society where people generally lived for 
at least three and a half centuries were necessarily of a different 
nature from those in the more primitive civilisations which had 
provided the Culture's original blood-stock.  Life-long monogamy was 
not utterly unknown, but it was exceptionally unusual.  A couple 
staying together for the duration of an offspring's entire childhood 
and adolescence was a more common occurrence, but still not the 
norm.  The average Culture child was close to its mother and almost 
certainly knew who its father was (assuming it was not in effect a 
clone of its mother, or had in place of a father's genes surrogated 
material which the mother had effectively manufactured), but it 

would probably be closer to the aunts and uncles who lived in the 
same extended familial grouping; usually in the same house, 
extended apartment or estate. 

There were partnerships which were intended to last, however, and 
one of the ways that certain couples chose to emphasise their co-
dependence was by synchronising their sex-changes and at different 
points playing both parts in the sexual act.  A couple would have a 
child, then the man would become female and the woman would 
become male, and they would have another child.  A more 
sophisticated version of this was possible due to the amount of control 
over one's reproductive system which still further historic genetic 
tinkering had made possible. 

It was possible for a Culture female to become pregnant, but then, 
before the fertilised egg had transferred from her ovary to the womb, 
begin the slow change to become a man.  The fertilised egg did not 
develop any further, but neither was it necessarily flushed away or 
reabsorbed.  It could be held, contained, put into a kind of suspended 
animation so that it did not divide any further, but waited, still inside 
the ovary.  That ovary, of course, became a testicle, but - with a bit 
of cellular finessing and some intricate plumbing - the fertilised egg 
could remain safe, viable and unchanging in the testicle while that 
organ did its bit in inseminating the woman who had been a man and 
whose sperm had done the original fertilising.  The man who had 
been a woman then changed back again.  If the woman who had been 
a man also delayed the development of her fertilised egg, then it was 
possible to synchronise the growth of the two fetuses and the birth 
of the babies. 

To some people in the Culture this - admittedly rather long-winded 
and time-consuming - process was quite simply the most beautiful 
and perfect way for two people to express their love for one 
another.  To others it was slightly gross and, well, tacky. 

The odd thing was that until he'd met and fallen in love with Dajeil, 
Genar-Hofoen had been firmly of the latter opinion.  He'd decided 
twenty years earlier, before he was even fully sexually mature and 
really knew his own mind about most things, that he was going to 
stay male all his life.  He could see that being able to change sex was 

useful and that some people would even find it exciting, but he 
thought it was weak, somehow. 

But then Dajeil had changed Byr's mind. 

They had met aboard the General Contact Unit Recent Convert. 

She was approaching the end of a twenty-five-year Contact career, 
he just starting a ten-year commitment which he might or might not 
request to extend when the time came.  He had been the rake, she 
the unavailable older woman.  He had decided when he'd joined 
Contact that he'd try to bed as many women as possible, and from 
the first had set about doing just that with a single-minded 
determination and dedication many women found highly fetching just 
by itself. 

Then on the Recent Convert he cut his usual swathe through the 
female half of the ship's human crew, but was brought to a sudden 
stop by Dajeil Gelian. 

It wasn't that she wouldn't sleep with him - there had been lots of 
women he'd asked who'd refused him, for a variety of reasons, and 
he'd never felt any resentment towards them or been any less likely 
to eventually count them as friends than the women he had made 
love to - it was that she told him she did find him attractive and 
ordinarily would have invited him to her bed, but wasn't going to 
because he was so promiscuous.  He'd found this a slightly 
preposterous reason, but had just shrugged and got on with life. 

They became friends; good friends.  They got on brilliantly; she 
became his best friend.  He kept expecting that this friendship would 
as a matter of course include sex - even if it was just once - but it 
didn't.  It seemed so obvious to him, so natural and normal and right 
that it should. Not falling into bed together after some wonderfully 
enjoyable social occasion or sports session or just a night's drinking 
seemed positively perverse to him. 

She told him he was destroying himself with his licentiousness.  He 
didn't understand her. She was destroying him, in a way; he was still 
seeing other women but he was spending so much time with her - 

because they were such friends, but also because she had become a 
challenge and he had decided he would win her, whatever it took - 
that his usual packed schedule of seductions, affairs and relationships 
had suffered terribly; he wasn't able to concentrate properly on all 
these other women who were, or ought to be demanding his 
attention. 

She told him he spread himself too thinly.  He wasn't really 
destroying himself, he was stopping himself from developing.  He was 
still in a sort of childish state, a boy-like phase where numbers 
mattered more than anything, where obsessive collecting, taking, 
enumerating, cataloguing all spoke of a basic immaturity.  He could 
never grow and develop as a human being until he went beyond this 
infantile obsession with penetration and possession. 

He told her he didn't want to get beyond this stage; he loved 
it.  Anyway, even though he loved it and wouldn't care if he remained 
promiscuous until he was too old to do it at all, the chances were that 
he would change, sometime, eventually, over the course of the next 
three centuries or so of life which he could expect… There 
was plenty of time to do all this damned growing and developing.  It 
would take care of itself.  He wasn't going to try and force the 
pace.  If all this sexual activity was something he had to get out of 
his system before he could properly mature, then she had a moral 
duty to help him get rid of it as quickly as possible, starting right 
now… 

She pushed him away, as ever.  He didn't understand, she told 
him.  It wasn't a finite supply of promiscuity he was draining, it was 
an ever-replenishing fixation that was eating up his potential for 
future personal growth.  She was the still point in his life he needed, 
or at least a still point; he would probably need many more in his life, 
she had no illusions about that.  But, for now, she was it.  She was 
the rock the river of his turbulent passion had to break around.  She 
was his lesson. 

They both specialised in the same area; exobiology.  He listened to 
her talk sometimes and wondered whether it was possible to feel 
more truly alien towards another being than it was to someone of 
one's own species who ought to think in an at least vaguely similar 

way, but instead thought utterly differently.  He could learn about an 
alien species, study them, get under their skin, under their carapaces, 
inside their spines or their membranes or whatever else you had to 
penetrate (ha!) to get to know them, get to understand them, and he 
could always, eventually, do that; he could start to think like them, 
start to feel things the way they would, anticipate their reactions to 
things, make a decent guess at what they were thinking at any given 
moment.  It was an ability he was proud of. 

Just by being so different from the creature you were studying you 
started out at a sufficiently great angle, it seemed to him, to be able 
to make that penetration and get inside their minds.  With somebody 
who was ninety-nine per cent the same as you, you were too close 
sometimes.  You couldn't draw far enough away from them to come 
in at a steep enough angle; you just slid off, every time in a 
succession of glancing contacts.  No getting through.  Frustration 
upon frustration. 

Then a post had come up on a world called Telaturier.  A long-term 
situation, spending anything up to five years with an aquatic species 
called the 'Ktik which the Culture wanted to help develop.  It was the 
sort of non-ship-based Contact post people were often offered at the 
end of their career; Dajeil was regarded as a natural for it.  It would 
mean one, maybe two people staying on the planet, otherwise alone 
save for the 'Ktik, for all that time.  There would be the occasional 
visit from others, but little time off and no extended holidays; the 
whole point was to establish a long-term personal relationship with 
'Ktik individuals.  It wasn't something to be entered into lightly; it 
would mean commitment.  Dajeil asked to be considered for the post 
and was accepted. 

Byr couldn't believe Dajeil was leaving the Recent Convert. He told 
her she was doing it to annoy him.  She told him he was being 
ridiculous.  And unbelievably self-centred.  She was doing it because 
it was an important job and it was something she felt she'd be good 
at.  It was also something she was ready for now; she had done her 
bit scudding round the galaxy in GCUs and enjoyed every moment, 
but now she had changed and it was time to take on something more 
long-term.  She would miss him, and she hoped he would miss her - 

though he certainly wouldn't miss her for as long as he claimed he 
would, or even as long as he thought he would - but it was time to 
move on, time to do something different.  She was sorry she hadn't 
been able to stick around longer, being his still point, but that was 
just the way it was, and this was too great an opportunity to miss. 

Later, he could never remember exactly when he'd made the decision 
to go with her, but he did.  Perhaps he had started to believe some 
of the things she'd been telling him, but he too just felt that it was 
time to do something different, even if he had only been in Contact 
for a short while. 

It was the hardest thing he'd ever done, harder than any seduction 
(with the possible exception of hers).  To start with, he had to 
convince her it was a good idea.  She wasn't even initially flattered, 
not for a second.  It was a terrible idea, she told him.  He was too 
young, too inexperienced, it was far, far too early in his Contact 
stint.  He wasn't impressing her; he was being stupid.  It wasn't 
romantic, it wasn't sensible, it wasn't flattering, it wasn't practical, it 
was just idiotic.  And if by some miracle they did let him go along 
with her, he needn't assume that just making this great commitment 
would ensure she'd sleep with him. 

This didn't prove anything except that he was as foolish as he was 
vain. 

III 

The General Contact Unit Grey Area didn't hold with avatars; it spoke 
through a slaved drone. 'Young lady-' 

'Don't you "young lady" me in that patronising tone!' Ulver Seich said, 
putting her hands on her suited, gem-encrusted hips.  She still had 
the suit helmet on, though with the visor plate hinged up.  They were 
in the GCU's hangar space with a variety of modules, satellites and 
assorted paraphernalia.  It looked like the space was fairly crowded 
at the best of times, but it was even more cluttered-now with the 
small module that had belonged to the ROU Frank Exchange of 
Views sitting in it. 

'Ms Seich,' the drone purred on, unaffected. 'I was not supposed to 
pick up you or your colleague Dn Churt Lyne.  I have done so because 
you were effectively adrift in the middle of a war zone.  If you really 
insist-' 

'We weren't adrift!' Ulver said, waving her arms around and pointing 
back at the module. 'We were in that!  It's got engines, you know!' 

'Yes, very slow ones.  I did say effectively adrift.' The ship-slaved 
drone, a casingless assemblage of components floating at head 
height, turned to the drone Churt Lyne. 'Dn Churt Lyne.  You too are 
welcome.  Would it be possible for you to attempt to persuade your 
colleague Ms Seich-' 

'And don't talk about me as if I'm not here either!' Ulver said, 
stamping one foot.  The deck under Genar-Hofoen's feet resounded. 

He had never been more glad to see a GCU.  Release from that 
damned 
module 
and 
Ulver 
Seich's 
abrasive 

moodiness.  Bliss.  The Grey Area had welcomed him first, he'd 
noticed. 

Finally he was back on course.  From here to the Sleeper, get the job 
done and then - if the war wasn't totally fucking things up - off for 
some R&R somewhere while things were settled.  He still found it 
hard to believe the Affront had actually declared war on the Culture, 
but assuming they really had then - once it was all over and the 
Affront had been put in their place - Culture people with Affront 
experience would be needed to help manage the peace and the 
Culturisation of the Affront.  In a way he would be sorry to see it; he 
liked them the way they were.  But if they were crazy enough to take 
on the Culture… maybe they did need teaching a lesson.  A bit of 
enforced niceness might do them some good. 

They weren't going to like it though, because it would be a niceness 
that was enforced leniently, patiently and gracefully, with the sort of 
unflappable self-certainty the Culture couldn't help displaying when 
all its statistics proved that it really was doing the right 
thing.  Probably the Affront would rather have been pulverised and 
then dictated to.  Anyway, whatever else happened between now and 

then, Genar-Hofoen was sure they'd give a good account of 
themselves. 

Ulver Seich was doing not badly in that line herself.  Now she was 
demanding she and the drone be put back in the module immediately 
and allowed to continue on their way.  Given that the first thing she'd 
done when the Grey Area had contacted them was demand to be 
rescued and taken aboard at once, this was a little cheeky, but the 
girl obviously didn't see it that way. 

'This is piracy!' she hollered. 

'Ulver…' the drone Churt Lyne said calmly. 

'And don't you go taking its side!' 

'I'm not taking its side, I'm just-' 

'You are so!' 

The argument went on.  The ship's slave-drone looked from the girl 
to the elderly drone and then back again.  It rose once in the air 
fractionally, then settled back down again.  It swivelled to Genar-
Hofoen. 'Excuse me,' it said quietly. 

Genar-Hofoen nodded. 

The drone Churt Lyne was cut off in mid-sentence and floated gently 
down to the floor of the hangar.  Ulver Seich scowled, furious.  Then 
she understood.  She turned on the slave-drone, whirling round and 
jabbing a finger at it. 'How da-!' 

The visor plate of her suit clanked shut; her suit powered down to 
statue-like immobility.  The jewelled face plate sparkled in the 
hangar's lights.  Genar-Hofoen thought he could hear some distant, 
muffled shouting from inside the girl's suit. 

'Ms Seich,' the drone said. 'I know you can hear me in there.  I'm 
terribly sorry to be so impolite, but I regret to say I was finding these 
exchanges somewhat tedious and unproductive.  The fact is that you 
are now entirely in my power, as I hope this little demonstration 

proves.  You can accept this and pass the next few days in relative 
comfort or refuse to accept this and either be locked up, followed by 
a drone intervention team or drugged to prevent you getting into 
mischief.  I assure you that in any other circumstance save that of 
war I would happily consign you and your colleague to your module 
and let you do as you wished.  However, as long as I am not called 
upon to perform any overtly military duties, you are almost certainly 
much safer with me than you are drifting along - or even purposefully 
moving along - in a small, unarmed and all but defenceless module 
which, I would beg you to believe, could nevertheless all too easily 
be mistaken for a munition or some sort of hostile craft by somebody 
inclined towards the reconnaissance-by-fire approach.' 

Genar-Hofoen could see the girl's suit shaking; it started to rock from 
side to side.  She must be throwing herself around inside it as best 
she could.  The suit came close to overbalancing and falling.  The 
little slave-drone extended a blue field to steady it.  Genar-Hofoen 
wondered how strong the urge had been to just let it fall. 

'If I am called upon to lend my weight to the proceedings, I shall let 
you go,' the ship's drone continued. 'Likewise, once I have discharged 
my duty to Mr Genar-Hofoen and the Special Circumstances section, 
you will, I imagine, be free to leave.  Thank you for listening.' 

Churt Lyne bobbed into the air and continued where it had left off.  '-
easonable for once in your pampered bloody life… !' then its voice 
trailed away.  It gave a wonderful impression of being confused, 
turning this way and that a couple of times. 

Ulver's face plate came up.  Her face was pale, her lips comεpressed 
into a line.  She was silent for a while.  Eventually she said, 'You are 
a very rude ship.  You had better hope you never have cause to call 
upon the hospitality of Phage Rock.' 

'If that is the price of your acquiescence to my entirely reasonable 
requests, then, young lady, you have a deal.' 

'And you'd better have some decent accommodation aboard this heap 
of junk,' she said, jabbing a thumb at Genar-Hofoen. 'I'm fed up 
inhaling this guy's testosterone.' 

IV 

He wore her down.  There was a half-year wait between her being 
accepted for the post on Telaturier and actually taking it up.  It took 
him almost all that time to talk her round.  Finally, a month before 
the ship would stop at Telaturier to deposit her there, she agreed that 
he could ask Contact if he could go with her.  He suspected that she 
only did so to get him to shut up and stop annoying her; she didn't 
imagine for a moment that he'd be accepted too. 

He dedicated himself to arguing his case.  He learned all he could 
about Telaturier and the 'Ktik; he reviewed the exobiological work 
he'd done until now and worked out how to emphasise the aspects of 
it that related to the post on Telaturier.  He built up an argument that 
he was all the more suited to this sort of stoic, sedentary post just 
because he had been so frenetic and busy in the past; he was, well, 
not burnt-out, but fully sated.  This was exactly the right time to slow 
down, draw breath, calm down.  This situation was perfect for him, 
and he for it. 

He set to work.  He talked to the Recent Convert itself, a variety of 
other Contact craft, several interested drones specialising in human 
psychovaluation and a human selection board.  It was working.  He 
wasn't meeting with unanimous approval - it was about fifty-fifty, 
with the Recent Convert leading the No group - but he was building 
support. 

In the end it came, down to a split decision and the casting vote was 
held by the GSV Quietly Confident, the Recent Convert's home 
craft.  By that time they were back aboard the Quietly Confident, 
hitching a lift towards the region of space where Telaturier lay.  An 
avatar of the Quietly Confident, a tall, distinεguished man, spoke at 
length to him about his desire to go with Dajeil to Telaturier.  He left 
saying that there would be a second interview. 

Genar-Hofoen, happy to be back on a ship with a hundred million 
females aboard, though not able to throw himself into the task of 
bedding as many of them as possible in the two weeks available, 
nevertheless did his best.  His fury at discovering, one morning, that 

the agile, willowy blonde he had spent the night with was another 
avatar of the ship was, by all accounts, a sight to behold. 

He raged, he seethed.  The quietly spoken avatar sat, winsomely 
dishevelled in his bed and looked on with calm, untroubled eyes. 

She hadn't told him she was an avatar! 

He hadn't asked, she pointed out.  She hadn't told him she was a 
human female, either.  She had been going to tell him she was there 
to evaluate him, but he had simply assumed that anyone he found 
attractive who came up to talk to him must want sex. 

It was still deceit! 

The avatar shrugged, got up and got dressed. 

He was desperately trying to remember what he'd said to the creature 
the previous evening and night; it had been a pretty drunken time 
and he knew he'd spoken about Dajeil and the whole Telaturier thing, 
but what had he said?  He was sickened at the ship's duplicity, 
appalled that it could trick him like this.  It wasn't playing fair.  Never 
trust a ship.  Oh, grief, he'd just been wittering on about Dajeil and 
the post with the 'Ktik, completely off-guard, not trying to impress at 
all.  Disaster.  He was certain the Recent Convert had put its mother 
ship up to it.  Bastards. 

The avatar had paused at the door of his cabin.  For what it was 
worth, she told him, he'd talked very eloquently about both his past 
life and the Telaturier post, and the ship was minded to support his 
application to accompany Dajeil Gelian there.  Then she winked at 
him and left. 

He was in.  There was just a moment of panic, but then an 
overwhelming feeling of victory.  He'd done it! 

V 

The Killing Time was still racing away from the ship store at Pittance 
at close to its maximum sustainable velocity; any faster and it would 

have started to degrade the performance of its engines.  It was 
approaching a position about half-way between Pittance and the 
Excession when it cut power and let itself coast down towards 
lightspeed.  It deliberately avoided doing its skidding-to-a-stop 
routine.  Instead it carefully extended a huge light-seconds-wide field 
across the skein of real space and slowly dragged itself to an absolute 
stop, its position within the three dimensions of normal space fixed 
and unchanging; its only appreciable vector of movement was 
produced by the expansion of the universe itself; the slow drawing 
away from the assumed central point of the Reality which all 3-D 
matter shared.  Then it signalled.

No.  Your gesture - offer - is appreciated.  However, we do have other

This is something personal.  I remain convinced there was another 
ship, an ex-Culture ship, at Pittance, to which I went because I saw 
fit to do so.  This ex-Culture ship thought to facilitate my 
destruction.  This cannot be tolerated.  Pride is at stake here.  My

however hateful we may find this.

Now you are attempting to stall.  If you do not agree to receive my

my mind-state? 

oo 

If you insist.  But it will be with a troubled conscience… 

It experienced the most minute moment of shame that it had ever 
despised such barbarians for their lack of civilisation.  It had always 
known that it was not their fault they had been such lowly 
creaεtures, but still it had found it difficult to expunge from its 
feelings towards such animals the patrician disdain so common 
amongst its fellow Minds.  Now, it recognised a kinship that crossed 
not just the ages, species or civilisations, but the arguably still greater 
gap between the fumblingly confused and dim awareness exhibited 
by the animal brain and the near-infinitely more extended, refined 
and integrated sentience of what most ancestor species were 
amusingly, quaintly pleased to call Artificial Intelligence (or 
something equally and - appropriately, perhaps - unconsciously 
disparaging). 

So now it had discovered the truth in the idea of a kind of purity in 
the contemplation of and preparations for self-sacrifice.  It was 
something its recently transferred mind-state - its new self, to be 
born in the matrix of a new warship, before too long - might never 
experience.  It briefly considered transmitting its current mind-state 
to replace the one it had already sent, but swiftly abandoned the idea; 
just more time to be wasted, for one thing, but more importantly, it 
felt it would insult the strange calmness and self-certainty it now felt 
to place it artificially in a Mind which was not about to die.  It would 
be inappropriate, perhaps even unsettling.  No; it would cleave to this 
clear surety exclusively, holding it to its exculpated soul like a 
talisman of holy certitude. 

The warship looked about its internal systems.  All was ready; any 
further delay would constitute prevarication.  It turned itself about, 
facing back the way it had come.  It powered up its engines slowly to 
accelerate gradually, sleekly away into the void.  As it moved, it left 
the skein of space behind it seeded with mines and hyper-space-
capable missiles.  They might only remove a ship or two even if they 
were lucky, but they would slow the rest down.  It ramped its speed 
up, to significant engine degradation in 128 hours, then 64, then 
32.  It held there.  To go any further would be to risk immediate and 
catastrophic disablement. 

It sped on through the dark hours of distance that to mere light were 
decades, glorying in its triumphant, sacrificial swiftness, radiant in its 
martial righteousness. 

It sensed the oncoming fleet ahead, like a pattern of brightly rushing 
comets in that envisaged space.  Ninety-six ships arranged in a rough 
circle spread across a front thirty years of 3-D space across, half 
above, half below the skein.  Behind them lay the traces of another 
wave, numerically the same size as the first but taking up twice the 
volume. 

There had been three hundred and eighty-four ships stored at 
Pittance.  Four waves, if each was the same size as the first.  Where 
would it position itself if it was in command? 

Near but not quite actually in the centre of the third wave. 

Would the command vessel guess this and so position itself 
somewhere else?  On the outside edge of the first wave, somewhere 
in the second wave, right at the back, or even way on the outside, 
independent of the main waves of craft altogether? 

Make a guess. 

It looped high out across the four-dimensional range of infra-space, 
sweeping its sensors across the skein and readying its weapon 
systems.  Its colossal speed was bringing the war fleet closer faster 
than anything it had ever seen before save in its most wildly indulged 
simulations.  It zoomed high above them in hyperspace, still, it 
seemed, undetected.  A pulse of sheer pleasure swept its Mind.  It 
had never felt so good.  Soon, very soon, it would die, but it would 
die gloriously, and its repuεtation pass on to the new ship born with 
its memories and personality, transmitted in its mind-state to 
the Shoot Them Later. 

It fell upon the third wave of oncoming ships like a raptor upon a 
flock. 

VI 

Byr stood on the circular stone platform at the top of the tower, 
looking out to the ocean where two lines of moonlight traced narrow 
silver lines across the restless waters.  Behind her, the tower's crystal 
dome was dark.  She had gone to bed at the same time as Dajeil, 
who tired more quickly these days.  They had made their apologies 
and left the others to fend for themselves.  Kran, Aist and Tulyi were 
all friends from the GCU Unacceptable Behaviour, another of 
the Quietly Confident's daughter ships.  They had known Dajeil for 
twenty years; the three had been aboard the Quietly Confident four 
years earlier and were some of the last people Byr and Dajeil had 
seen before they'd left for Telaturier. 

The Unacceptable Behaviour was looping through this volume and 
they'd persuaded it to let them stop off here for a couple of days and 
see their old friend. 

The moons glittered their stolen light across the fretful dance of 
waves, and Byr too reflected, glanding a little Diffuse and thinking 
that the moons' V of light, forever converging on the observer, 
encouraged a kind of egocentricity, an overly romantic idea of one's 
own 
centrality 
to 
things, 
an 
illusory 
belief 
in 
personal 

precedence.  She remembered the first time she had stood here and 
thought something along these lines, when she had been a man and 
he and Dajeil had not long arrived here. 

It had been the first night he and Dajeil had - finally, at last, after all 
that fuss - lain together.  Then he had come up here in the middle of 
the night while she'd slept on, and gazed out over these waters.  It 
had been almost calm, then, and the moons' tracks (when they rose, 
and quite as though they rose and did not rise for him) lay 
shimmering slow and near unbroken on the untroubled face of the 
ocean's slack waters. 

He'd wondered then if he'd made a terrible mistake.  One part of his 
mind was convinced he had, another part claimed the moral high 
ground of maturity and assured him it was the smartest move he'd 
ever made, that he was indeed finally growing up.  He had decided 
that night that even if it was a mistake that was just too bad; it was 

a mistake that could only be dealt with by embracing it, by grasping 
it with both hands and accepting the results of his decision; his pride 
could only be preserved by laying it aside entirely for the 
duration.  He would make this work, he would perform this task and 
be blameless in the self-sacrifice of his own interests to Dajeil's.  His 
reward was that she had never seemed happier, and that, almost for 
the first time, he felt responsible for another's pleasure on a scale 
beyond the immediate. 

When, months later, she had suggested that they have a child, and 
later still, while they were still mulling this over, that they Mutual - 
for they had the time, and the commitment - he had been 
extravagant in his enthusiasm, as though through such loud acclaim 
he could drown out the doubts he heard inside himself. 

'Byr?' a soft voice said from the little cupola that gave access from 
the steps to the roof. 

She turned round. 'Hello?' 

'Hi.  Couldn't sleep either, eh?' Aist said, joining Byr at the 
paraεpet.  She was dressed in dark pyjamas; her naked feet slap-
slapped on the flagstones. 

'No,' Byr said.  She didn't need much sleep.  Byr spent quite a lot of 
time by herself these days, while Dajeil slept or sat cross-legged in 
one of her trances or fussed around in the nursery they had prepared 
for their children. 

'Same here,' Aist said, crossing her arms beneath her breasts and 
leaning out over the parapet, her head and shoulders danεgling over 
the drop.  She spat slowly; the little fleck fell whitely through the 
moonlight and disappeared against the dark slope of the tower's 
bottom storey.  She rocked back onto her feet and moved some of 
her medium-length brown hair off her eyes, while she studied Byr's 
face, a small frown just visible on her brow.  She shook her head. 
'You know,' she said, 'I never thought you'd be one to change sex, 
let alone have a kid.' 

'Same here,' Byr said, leaning on the parapet and gazing out to sea. 
'Still can't believe it, sometimes.' 

Aist leant beside him. 'Still, it's okay, isn't it?  I mean, you're happy, 
aren't you?' 

Byr glanced at the other woman. 'Isn't it obvious?' 

Aist was silent for a while.  Eventually she said, 'Dajeil loves you very 
much.  I've known her twenty years.  She's changed completely too, 
you know; not just you.  She was always really independent, never 
wanted to be a mother, never wanted to settle down with one person, 
not for a long time, anyway.  Not until she was old.  You've both 
changed each other so much.  It's… it's really something.  Almost 
scary, but, well, sort of impressive, you know?' 

'Of course.' 

There was silence for another while. 'When do you think you'll have 
your baby?' Aist asked. 'How long after she has… Ren, isn't it?' 

'Yes; Ren.  I don't know.  We'll see.' Byr gave a small laugh, almost 
more of a cough. 'Maybe we'll wait until Ren is grown up enough to 
help us look after it.' 

Aist made the same noise.  She leant on the parapet again, lifting her 
feet off the flagstones and balancing, pivoting on her folded arms. 
'How's it been here, being so far away from anybody else?  Do you 
get many visitors?' 

Byr shook her head. 'No.  You're only the third lot of people we've 
seen.' 

'Gets lonely, I suppose.  I mean I know you've got each other, but…' 

'The 'Ktik are fun,' Byr said. 'They're people, individuals.  I've met 
thousands of them by now, I suppose.  There are something like 
twenty or thirty million of them.  Lots of new little chums to meet.' 

Aist sniggered. 'Don't suppose you can get it off with them, can you?' 

Byr glanced at her. 'Never tried.  Doubt it.' 

'Boy, you were some swordsman, Byr,' Aist said. 'I remember you on 
the Quietly, first time we met.  I'd never met anyone so focused.' She 
laughed. 'On anything!  You were like a natural force or something; 
an earthquake or a tidal wave.' 

'Those are natural disasters,' Byr pointed out with feigned frostiness. 

'Well, close enough then,' Aist said, laughing gently.  She glanced 
slyly, slowly, at the other woman. 'I suppose I'd have found myself 
in the firing line if I'd stuck around longer.' 

'I imagine you might,' Byr said in a tired, resigned voice. 

'Yup, could all have turned out completely different,' Aist said. 

Byr nodded. 'Or it could all have turned out exactly the same.' 

'Well, don't sound so happy about it,' Aist said. 'I wouldn't have 
minded.' She leant over the parapet and spat delicately again, moving 
her head just so, flicking the spittle outward.  This time it landed on 
the gravel path which skirted the tower's stone base.  She made an 
approving noise and looked back at Byr, wiping her chin and 
grinning.  She looked at Byr, studying his face again. 'It's not fair, 
Byr,' she said. 'You look good no matter what you are.' She put one 
hand out slowly towards Byr's cheek.  Byr looked into her large dark 
eyes. 

One moon started to disappear behind a ragged layer of high cloud 
and a small wind picked up, smelling of rain. 

A test, for her friend, Byr thought, as the other woman's long fingers 
gently stroked her face, feather soft.  But the fingers were 
trembling. Still a test; determined to do it but nervous about it.  Byr 
put her hand up and held the woman's fingers lightly.  She took it as 
a signal to kiss her. 

After a little while, Byr said, 'Aist…' and started to pull away. 

'Hey,' she said softly, 'this doesn't mean anything, all right?  Just 
lust.  Doesn't mean a thing.' 

A little later still Byr said, 'Why are we doing this?' 

'Why not?' Aist breathed. 

Byr could think of several reasons, asleep in the stony darkness 
beneath them. How I have changed, she thought. But then again, not 
that much. 

VII 

Ulver Seich strolled through the accommodation section of the Grey 
Area. At least there was a bit more strolling to be done on the GCU; 
had she come here straight from the family house on Phage it would 
have seemed horribly cramped, but after the claustroεphobic 
confines of the Frank Exchange of Views, it appeared almost spacious 
(she had spent so little time on Tier, and passed the small amount of 
time she had there in such a frenetic haste of preparation that it 
hardly counted.  As for the nine-person module - ugh!). 

The Grey Area's interior - built to house three hundred people in 
reasonable if slightly compact comfort, and now home only to her, 
Churt Lyne and Genar-Hofoen - was actually pretty interesting, which 
was 
an 
unexpected 
plus 
on 
this 
increasingly 
disillusioning 

expedition.  The ship was like a museum to torture, death and 
genocide; it was filled with mementoes and souvenirs from hundreds 
of different planets, all testifying to the tendency towards 
institutionalised cruelty exhibited by so many forms of intelligent 
life.  From thumbscrews and pilliwinks to death camps and planet-
swallowing black holes, the Grey Area had examples of the devices 
and entities involved, or of their effects, or documentary recordings 
of their use. 

Most of the ship's corridors were lined with weaponry, the larger 
pieces standing on the floor, others on tables; bigger items took up 
whole cabins, lounges or larger public spaces and the very biggest 
weapons were shown as scale models.  There were thousands of 
instruments of torture, clubs, spears, knives, swords, strangle cords, 

catapults, bows, powder guns, shells, mines, gas canisters, bombs, 
syringes, mortars, howitzers, missiles, atomics, lasers, field arms, 
plasma guns, microwavers, effectors, thunderbolters, knife missiles, 
line guns, thudders, gravguns, monofilament warps, pancakers, AM 
projectors, grid-fire impulsers, ZPE flux-polarisers, trapdoor units, 
CAM spreaders and a host of other inventions designed for - or 
capable of being turned to the purpose of producing death, 
destruction and agony. 

Some of the cabins and larger spaces had been fitted out to resemble 
torture chambers, slave holds, prison cells and death chambers 
(including the ship's swimming pool, though after she'd pointedly 
mentioned that she liked to start each day with a dip, this was now 
being converted back to its original purpose).  Ulver supposed these… 
stage-sets… were a little like the famous tableaux the Sleeper 
Service was supposed to contain, except that the Grey Area's had no 
bodies in them (something of a relief, in the circumstances). 

Like a lot of people, she had always wanted to see the real thing.  She 
had asked if she and Churt Lyne might go aboard the GSV when 
Genar-Hofoen did, but her request had been turned down; they would 
have to stay on the Grey Area until the GCU could find somewhere 
both safe and unrestricted to deposit them.  What made it all even 
more annoying in a way was that the Grey Area expected it would be 
keeping in close contact with the Sleeper Service; inside its field 
envelope, if it was allowed to.  So near and yet so far and all that 
crap.  Whatever; it looked like she wouldn't get to see even the 
remnants of the famous craft's tableaux vivants, and would have to 
make do with the Grey Area and its tableaux mortants. 

She thought they might have been more effective if they had 
contained the victims or the victims and tormentors, but they 
didn't.  Instead they contained just the rack, the iron maiden, the 
fires and the irons, the shackles and the beds and chairs, the buckets 
of water and acid and the electric cables and all the serried 
instruments of torture and death.  To see them in action you had to 
stand before a nearby screen. 

It was a little shocking, Ulver supposed, but kind of aloof at the same 
time; it was like you could just inspect this stuff and get some idea 

of how it worked and what it did (though watching the screens wasn't 
really advisable; she watched one for a few seconds and nearly lost 
her breakfast; and it wasn't even humans who were being tortured) 
and you could sort of ride it out; you could accept that this had 
happened and feel bad about it all right, but at the end of it you were 
still here, it hadn't happened to you, stopping this sort of shit was 
exactly what SC, Contact, the Culture was about, and you were part 
of that civilisation, part of that civilising… and that sort of made it 
bearable.  Just.  If you didn't watch the screens. 

Still, just holding a little iron device designed to crush the sort of 
fingers that were holding it, looking at a knotted cord whose twin 
knots - once the cord was tightened behind the head - were set at 
just the right distance to compress and burst the sort of eyes that 
were looking at it… well, it was kind of affecting.  She spent a fair bit 
of time shivering and rubbing the bits of her body that kept getting 
bumps. 

She wondered how many people had looked upon this grisly collection 
of memorabilia.  She had asked the ship but it had been vague; 
apparently it regularly offered its services as a sort of travelling 
museum of pain and ghastliness, but it rarely had any takers. 

One of the exhibits which she discovered, towards the end of her 
wanderings, she did not understand.  It was a little bundle of what 
looked like thin, glisteningly blue threads, lying in a shallow bowl; a 
net, like something you'd put on the end of a stick and go fishing for 
little fish in a stream.  She tried to pick it up; it was impossibly slinky 
and the material slipped through her fingers like oil; the holes in the 
net were just too small to put a finger-tip through.  Eventually she 
had to tip the bowl up and pour the blue mesh into her palm.  It was 
very light.  Something about it stirred a vague memory in her, but 
she couldn't recall what it was.  She asked the ship what it was, via 
her neural lace. 

~ That is a neural lace, it informed her. ~ A more exquisite and 
economical method of torturing creatures such as yourself has yet to 
be invented. 

She gulped, quivered again and nearly dropped the thing. 

~ Really? she sent, and tried to sound breezy. ~ Ha.  I'd never really 
thought of it that way. 

~ It is not generally a use much emphasised. 

~ I suppose not, she replied, and carefully poured the fluid little 
device back into its bowl on the table. 

She walked back to the cabin she'd been given, past the assorted 
arms and torture machines.  She decided to check up on how the war 
was going, again through the lace.  At least it would take her mind 
off all this torture shit.

It should not have made the difference that it did, and yet it 
did.  Their three visitors stayed for two nights, going swimming with 
the 'Ktik during the second day.  Byr met Aist again that night.  The 
following day the visitors left, climbing into the module which 
the Unacceptable Behaviour sent down for them.  The ship was 
heading off to loop round a proto-nova a few thousand years 
distant.  It would be back in two weeks to drop off any further 
supplies they might need.  Dajeil's baby would be born a couple of 

weeks after that.  The next ship due to visit would be another year 
away, when they might have doubled the human population of the 
planet.  They stood together on the beach.  Dajeil held Byr's hand as 
the module climbed into the slate-coloured clouds. 

Later that evening Byr found Dajeil watching the recording in the 
tower's top room, where the screens were.  Tears ran down her face. 

There were no monitor systems on the tower itself.  It must have 
been one of the independent camera drones.  This one must have 
landed on the tower that night, found two large mammals there, and 
started recording. 

Dajeil turned to look at Byr, her face streaked with the tears.  Byr felt 
a sudden welling of anger.  On the screen, she watched the two 
people embracing, caressing on the tower's moonlit roof, and heard 
the soft gasps and whisperings. 

'Yes,' Byr said, smiling ironically as she pulled off the wet suit. 'Old 
Aist, eh?  Quite a lass.  You shouldn't cry, you know.  Upsets the 
body's fluid balance for baby.' 

Dajeil threw a glass at her.  It smashed behind Byr on the winding 
stair.  A little servitor drone scurried past Byr's feet and windmilled 
down the carpeted steps on its little limbs, to start cleaning up the 
mess.  Byr looked into her lover's face.  Dajeil's swollen breasts rose 
and fell within her shirt and her face was flushed.  Byr continued to 
peel off bits of the wet suit. 

'It was a bit of light relief, for grief's sake,' she said, keeping her voice 
even. 'Just a friendly fuck.  A loose end sort of thing.  It-' 

'How could you do this to us?' Dajeil screamed. 

'Do what?' Byr protested, still trying to keep her voice from rising. 
'What have I done?' 

'Screwing my best friend, here!  Now!  After everything!' 

'You shit!  Don't laugh about it!' Dajeil screamed.  Her voice was 
hoarse, unlike anything Byr had heard from her before. 'Don't you 
fucking laugh about it!' Dajeil was suddenly up out of her seat and 
dashing towards her, arms raised. 

Byr caught her wrists. 

'Dajeil!' she said, as the other woman struggled and sobbed and tried 
to shake her hands free. 'You're being ridiculous!  I always fucked 
other people; you were fucking other people when you were giving 
me all this shit about being my "still point"; we both knew, it wasn't 
like we were juveniles or in some dumb monogamy cult or 
something.  Shit; so I stuck my fingers in your pal's cunt; so fucking 
what?  She's gone.  I'm still here; you're still here, the fucking kid's 
still in your belly; yours is in mine.  Isn't that what you said is all that 
matters?' 

'You bastard, you bastard!' Dajeil cried, and collapsed.  Byr had to 
support her as she crumpled to the floor, sobbing unconεtrollably. 

'Oh, Dajeil, come on; this isn't anything that matters.  We never 
swore to be faithful, did we?  It was just a friendly… it was politeness, 
for fuck's sake.  I didn't even think it was worth mentioning… Come 
on, I know this is a tough time for you and there's all these hormones 
and shit in your body, but this is crazy; you're reacting… crazily…' 

'Fuck off!  Fuck off and leave me alone!' Dajeil spat, her voice reduced 
to a croak. 'Leave me alone!' 

'Dajeil,' Byr said, kneeling down beside her. 'Please… Look, I'm 
sorry.  I really am.  I've never apologised for fucking anybody in my 
life before; I swore I never would, but I'm doing it now.  I can't undo 
it, but I didn't realise it would affect you like this.  If I had I wouldn't 
have done it.  I swear.  I'd never have done it; it was she who kissed 
me first.  I didn't set out to seduce her or anything, but I'd have said 
No, I'd have said No, really I would.  It wasn't my idea, it wasn't my 
fault.  I'm sorry.  What more can I say?  What can I do… ?' 

It did no good.  Dajeil wouldn't talk after that.  She wouldn't be 
carried to her bed.  She didn't want to be touched or be brought 
anything to eat or drink.  Byr sat at the screen controls while Dajeil 
whimpered on the floor. 

Byr found the recording the camera drone had taken and wiped it. 

IX 

The Grey Area did something to his eyes.  It happened in his sleep, 
the first night he was aboard.  He woke up in the morning to the 
sound of song birds trilling over distant waterfalls and the faint smell 
of tree resin; one wall of his cabin impersonated a window high up in 
a forest-swathed mountain range.  There was a memory of some 
strangeness, a buried recollection of some sort; half real, half not, 
but it slipped slowly away as he came fully to.  The view was blurry 
for a moment, then slowly came clear as he recalled the ship asking 
him last night if it could implant the nanotechs while he slept.  His 
eyes tingled a little and he wiped away some tears, but then 
everything seemed to settle back to normal. 

'Ship?' he said. 

'Yes?' replied the cabin. 

'Is that it?' he asked. 'With the implants?' 

'Yes.  There's a modified neural lace in place in your skull; it'll take a 
day or so to bed in properly.  I hurried up a little repair-work your 
own systems were taking their time with near your visual cortex.  You 
have hit your head recently?' 

'Yeah.  Fell out of a carriage.' 

'How are your eyes?' 

'Bit blurred and smarted a little.  Okay now.' 

'Later today we'll go through a simulation of what happens when 
you've 
interfaced 
with 
the Sleeper 
Service's Storage 
vault 

system.  All right?' 

'Fine.  How's our rendezvous with the Sleeper looking?' 

'All is in hand.  I expect to transfer you in four days.' 

'Great.  And what's happening with the war?' 

'Nothing much.  Why?' 

'I just wanted to know,' Genar-Hofoen said. 'Have there been any 
major actions yet?  Any more cruise ships been taken hostage?' 

'I am not a news service, Genar-Hofoen.  You have a terminal, I 
believe.  I suggest you use it.' 

'Well, thank you for your help,' muttered the man, swinging out of 
bed.  He had never met so unhelpful a ship.  He went for breakfast; 
at least it ought to be able to provide that. 

He was sitting alone in the ship's main mess watching his favourite 
Culture news service via a holo projected by his terε minal.  After 
the first flurry of Affront Orbital and cruise ship takeovers with no 
obvious Culture military reply but talk of a mobilisation taking place 
(frustratingly, 
almost 
entirely 
beyond 
the 
news 
services' 

perceptions), the war seemed to have entered a period of relative 
quiescence.  Right now the news service was running a semi-serious 
feature on how to ingratiate yourself with an Affronter if you 
happened to bump into one - when the dream he had had last night 
- the thing he had half remembered just after the point of waking - 
suddenly returned to him. 

X 

Byr awoke that night to find Dajeil standing over her with a diving 
knife held tightly in both hands, her eyes wide and full and staring, 
her face still puffy with tears.  There was blood on the knife.  What 
had she done to herself?  Blood on the knife.  Then the pain snapped 
back.  The first reaction of Byr's body had been just to blank it 
out.  Now she was awake, it came back.  Not the agony a basic 
human would have experienced, but a deep, shocking, awful 
awareness of damage a civilised creature could appreciate without 

the disabling suffering of crude pain.  Byr took a moment to 
understand. 

What?  What had been done?  What?  Roaring in ears.  Looking up, 
to find all the sheets red.  Her blood.  Belly; sliced.  Open.  Glistening 
masses 
of 
green, 
purple, 
yellow.  Redness 
still 

pumping.  Shock.  Massive 
blood 
loss.  What 
would 
Dajeil 
do 

now?  Byr sank back.  So this was how it ended. 

Mess, 
indeed.  Feel 
of 
systems 
shutting 
down.  Losing 
the 

body.  Brain drawing blood to it storing oxygen determined to stay 
alive as long as possible even though it had lost its life-support 
mechanism.  They had medical gear in the tower that could save her 
still but Dajeil just stood there staring as though sleep-walking or 
mad with some overdone gland-drug.  Standing staring at her 
standing staring at her dying. 

Neatness to it, still.  Women; penetration.  He had lived for it.  Now 
he died of it.  Now he/she would die, and Dajeil would know that he 
had really loved her. 

Did that make sense? 

Did it? she asked the man she had once been. 

Silence from him; not dead but certainly gone, gone for now.  She 
was on her own, dying on her own.  Dying at the hand of the only 
woman she/he had ever loved. 

So did it make sense? 

… I am who I ever was.  What I called masculinity, what I celebrated 
in it was just an excuse for me-ness, wasn't it? 

No.  No.  No and fuck this, lady. 

Byr stuck both hands over the wound and the awful, heavy flap of 
flesh and swung out of the bed on the far side, dragging the blood-
heavy top sheet with her.  She stumbled to the bathroom, holding 
her guts in and trying all the time to watch the other woman.  Dajeil 

stood staring at the bed, as though not realising Byr had gone, as 
though staring at a projection she alone could see, or at a ghost. 

Byr's legs and feet were covered in blood.  She slipped against the 
door jamb and almost blacked out, but managed to stagger into the 
room's pastel fragrance.  The bathroom door locked behind her.  She 
sank to her knees.  Loud roar in head now; tunnel vision, like wrong 
end of a telescope.  Deep, sharp smell of blood; startling, shocking, 
all by itself. 

The life-support collar was in a box with the other emergency medical 
supplies, thoughtfully located below waist level so you could crawl to 
it.  Byr clamped the collar on and curled up on the floor, clamped and 
curled around the fissure in her abdomen and the long gory umbilical 
of shiningly red sheet.  Something hissed and tingled around her 
neck. 

Even staying curled up was too much effort.  She flopped over on the 
tiles' soft warmth.  It was easy, all the blood made it so slippery. 

XI 

In the dream, he watched as Zreyn Tramow rose from a bed of pink 
petals.  Some still adhered, like small local blushes dispensed upon 
her pink-brown nakedness.  She dressed in her uniform of soft grey 
and made her way to the bridge, nodding to and exchanging 
pleasantries with the others on her shift and those going off-
watch.  She donned the sculpted shell of the induction helmet, and - 
in half an eye-blink - was floating in space. 

Here was the vast enfolding darkness, the sheer astringent emptiness 
of space colossal, writ wide and deep across the entire sensorial 
realm; an unending presagement of consummate grace and 
meaninglessness together.  She looked about the void, and far stars 
and galaxies went swivelling within her field of vision.  The view 
settled on: 

The strange star.  The enigma. 

At such moments she felt the loneliness not just of this fathomless 
wilderness and this near-utter emptiness, but of her own position, 
and of her whole life. 

Ship names; she had heard of a craft called I Blame My Mother, and 
another called I Blame Your Mother. Perhaps, then, it was a more 
common complaint than she normally allowed for (and of course she 
had ended up on this ship, with its own particular chosen name, 
forever wondering whether it had been one of those little conceits of 
her superiors to pair them so).  Did she blame her mother?  She 
supposed she did.  She did not think she could claim any technical 
deficiency in the love attending her upbringing, and yet - at the time 
- she had felt there was, and to this day she would have claimed that 
the technicalities of a childhood did not cover all that might be 
required by certain children; in short, her aunts had never been 
enough.  She knew of many individuals raised by people other than 
their natural parent, and to a man and to a woman they all seemed 
happy and content enough, but it had not been that way for her.  She 
had long ago accepted that whatever it was she felt was wrong, it 
was in some sense her fault, even if it was a fault that derived from 
causes she could do nothing to alter. 

Her mother had chosen to remain in Contact following the birth of her 
child and had left to return to her ship not long after the girl's first 
birthday. 

Her aunts had been loving and attentive and she had never had the 
heart - or worked up the hurtful malice - to let them or anybody else 
know the aching void she felt inside herself, no matter how many 
times she had lain in tears in her bed, rehearsing the words she would 
use to do just that. 

She supposed she might have transferred some of her need for a 
parent to her father, but she had scarcely felt that he was a part of 
her life; he was just another man who came to the house, sometimes 
stayed for a while, played with her and was kind and even loving, but 
(she had known instinctively at first, and later admitted rationally to 
herself after a few years of self-delusion) had played, been kind and 
even loved her in a more cheerily vague and off-hand sort of way 
than many of her uncles; she imagined now that he had loved her in 

his own fashion and had enjoyed being with her, and assuredly she 
had felt a certain warmth at the time, but still, before very long, even 
as an infant, before she knew the precise reasons, motives and 
desires involved, she had guessed that the frequency and length of 
his visits to the house had more to do with his interest in one or two 
of her aunts than in any abiding tenderness he felt towards his 
daughter. 

Her mother returned now and again, for visits that for both of them 
veered wildly between painful feelings of love and furious rages of 
resentment.  Somehow, later, exhausted and dismayed by these 
sapping, abrasive, attriting episodes, they came to a sort of truce; 
but it was at the expense of any closeness. 

By the time her mother returned for good, she was like just another 
girlfriend; they both had better friends. 

So she had always been alone.  And she suspected, she almost knew, 
that she would end her days alone.  It was a source of sadness - 
though she tried never to wallow in self-pity - and even, in a 
subsidiary way, of shame, for at the back of her mind she could not 
escape the nagging desire for somebody - some man, if she was 
honest with herself - to come to her rescue, to take her away from 
the vacuum that was her existence and make her no longer alone.  It 
was something she had never been able to confess to anybody, and 
yet something that she had an inkling was known to the people and 
machines who had allowed her to assume this exalted, if onerous 
position. 

She hoped that it was secret within herself, but knew too well the 
extent of the knowledge-base, the sheer experience behind those 
who exercised power over her and people like her.  An individual did 
not outwit such intelligence; he or she might come to an 
understanding with it, an accommodation with it, but there was no 
outthinking or outsmarting it; you had to accept the likelihood that 
all your secrets would be known to them and trust that they would 
not misuse that knowledge, but exploit it without malice.  Her fears, 
her needs, her insecurities, her compensating drives and ambitions; 
they could be plumbed, measured and then used, they could be 
employed.  It was a pact, she supposed, and one she did not really 

resent, for it was a mutually beneficial arrangement.  They and she 
each got what they wanted; they a canny, dedicated officer 
determined to prove herself in the application of their cause and she 
the chance to seek and gain approval, the reassurance that she was 
worth something. 

Such trust, and the multiplying opportunities to provide proof of her 
diligence and exercised wisdom, ought at last to be enough for her, 
but still sometimes it was not, and she yearned for something that 
no fusion of herself with any conglomerative could provide; a need to 
be reassured of a personal worth, an appreciation of her individual 
value which would only be valid coming from another individual. 

She went through cycles of admitting this to herself and hoping that 
one day she would find somebody she could finally feel comfortable 
with, finally respect, finally judge worthy of her regard when 
measured against her own strict standards… and then rejecting it all, 
fierce in her determination to prove herself on her terms and the 
terms of the great service she had entered, forging the resolve to 
turn her frustrations to her and their advantage, to redirect the 
energies resulting from her loneliness into her practical, methodically 
realisable ambitions; another qualification, a further course of study, 
a promotion, command, further advancement… 

The enigma attracted her, no less than the impossibly old star.  Here, 
in this discovery, might eventually lie a kind of fame that could sate 
her desire for recognition.  Or so she told herself, sometimes.  Here, 
after all, was already a strange kind of kinship, a sort of twinning, 
even if it was that of an implausibility and a mystery. 

She directed her attention to the enigma, seeming to rush towards it 
in the darkness, swelling its black presence until it filled her field of 
vision. 

A blink of light focused her awareness near its centre.  Somehow, 
without much more than that single glimmer, the light had a kind of 
character to it, something familiar, recognisable; it was like the 
opening of a door, like gaining an unexpected glimpse into a brightly 
lit room.  Attention drawn, she looked closer automatically. 

And was instantly sucked into the light; it erupted blindingly, 
exploding out at her like some absurdly quick solar flare, engulfing 
her, snapping around her like a trap. 

Zreyn Enhoff Tramow, captain of the General Contact Ship Problem 
Child, barely had time to react.  Then she was plucked away and 
disappeared into the coruscating depths of the falling fire, struggling 
and trapped and calling for help.  Calling to him. 

He bounced awake on the bed-field, eyes suddenly open, breath fast 
and shallow, heart hammering.  The cabin's lights came on, dim at 
first and then brightening gently, reacting to his movements. 

Genar-Hofoen wiped his face with his hands and looked around the 
cabin.  He swallowed and took a deep breath.  He hadn't meant to 
dream anything like that.  It had been as vivid as an implanted dream 
or some game-scenario shared in sleep.  He had meant to dream one 
of his usual erotic dreams, not look back two thousand years to the 
time when the Problem Child had first found the trillion-year-old sun 
and the black-body object in orbit around it.  All he'd wanted was a 
sex-simulation, not an in-depth inquisition of a bleakly ambitious 
woman's arid soul. 

Certainly it had been interesting, and he'd been fascinated that he 
had somehow been the woman and yet not been her at the same 
time, and had been - non-sexually - inside her, in her mind, close as 
a neural lace to her thoughts and emotions and the hopes and fears 
she had been prompted to think about by the sight of the star and 
the thing she had thought of as the enigma.  But it hadn't been what 
he'd expected. 

Another strange, unsettling dream. 

'Ship?' he said. 

'Yes?' the Grey Area said through the cabin's sound system. 

'I… I just had a weird dream.' 

'Well, I have some experience in that realm, I suppose,' the ship said 
with what sounded like a heavy sigh. 'I imagine now you want to talk 
about it.' 

'No… well… no; I just wondered… you weren't… ?' 

'Ah.  You want to know was I interfering with your dreams, is that it?' 

'It just, you know, occurred to me.' 

'Well now, let's see… If I had been, do you think I would answer you 
truthfully?' 

He thought. 'Does that mean you were or you weren't?' 

'I was not.  Are you happy now?' 

'No I'm not happy now.  Now I don't know if you were or you weren't.' 
He shook his head, and grinned. 'You're fucking with my head either 
way, aren't you?' 

'As if I would do such a thing,' the ship said smoothly.  It made a 
chuckling noise which contrived to be the most unsettling sound it 
had articulated so far. 'I expect,' it said, 'it was just an effect caused 
by your neural lace bedding in, Genar-Hofoen.  Nothing to worry 
about.  If you don't want to dream at all, gland somnabsolute.' 

'Hmm,' he said slowly, and then; 'Lights out.' He lay back down in the 
darkness. 'Good night,' he said quietly. 

'Sweet dreams, Genar-Hofoen,' the Grey Area said.  The circuit 
clicked ostentatiously off. 

He lay awake in the darkness for a while, before falling asleep again. 

XII 

Byr woke up in bed, hopelessly weak, but cleansed and whole and 
starting to recover.  The emergency medical collar lay, also cleaned, 
at the side of the bed.  By it lay a bowl of fruit, a jug of milk, a screen, 

and the small figurine Byr had given Dajeil, from the old female 'Ktik 
called G'Istig'tk't', a few days earlier. 

The tower's slave-drones brought Byr her food and attended to her 
toilet.  The first question she asked was where Dajeil was, half afraid 
that the other woman had taken the knife to herself or just walked 
into the sea.  The drones replied that Dajeil was in the tower's 
garden, weeding. 

On other occasions they informed Byr that Dajeil was working in the 
tower's top room, or swimming, or had taken a flier to some distant 
island.  They answered other questions, too.  It was Dajeil - along 
with one of the drones - who had forced open the bathroom door.  So 
she could still have killed Byr. 

Byr asked Dajeil to come visit her, but she would not.  Eventually, a 
week later, Byr was able to get out of bed by herself and walk 
around.  A pair of drones fussed at her side. 

Across her belly, the scar was already starting to fade. 

Byr already knew her recovery would be complete.  Whether Dajeil 
had actually intended murder or just some insane abortion, she didn't 
know. 

Looking down into herself, in a light trance to further judge the extent 
of the damage that had been done and was now diligently repairing 
itself, Byr noted that her body had come to the decision, apparently 
on its own accord, while she'd been unconscious, to become male 
again.  She let the decision hold. 

Byr walked out of the tower that day with one hand still held over the 
wide scar in her abdomen.  She discovered Dajeil sitting cross-legged 
and big-bellied on the egg-round stones a few metres up from the 
surf line. 

The sound of the stones sliding under Byr's unsteady feet brought 
Dajeil out of her reverie.  She looked round at Byr, then away again, 
out to sea.  They sat together. 

'I'm sorry,' Dajeil said. 

'So am I.' 

'Did I kill it?' 

Byr had to think for a moment.  Then she realised.  She meant the 
fetus. 

'Yes,' Byr said. 'Yes, it's gone.' 

Dajeil lowered her head.  She would not talk again. 

Contact was never told what had happened.  Byr claimed a bizarre 
accident had happened at sea to make her lose the fetus; a predator 
fish attacking; near death and saved by Dajeil… They seemed well 
enough pleased with what she and Dajeil had done and accepted Byr's 
leaving early.  The 'Ktik were a highly promising species, hungry for 
advancement; Telaturier was in for some big-time development. 

Genar-Hofoen became male again.  One day, going through some old 
clothes, he found the little figurine of Dajeil the old 'Ktik had 
carved.  He sent it back to Dajeil.  He didn't know if she received it 

or not.  Still on the Unacceptable Behaviour, he fathered a child by 
Aist.  A Contact appointment a few months afterwards took him 
aboard the GSV Quietly Confident. One of the ship's avatars - the 
same one he had slept with - gave him a very hard time for leaving 
Dajeil; they shouted at each other. 

To his knowledge, the Quietly Confident subsequently blocked at 
least one request he put in for a post he wanted. 

Over two years after he had left Telaturier he heard that Dajeil, still 
pregnant, had requested to be Stored.  The place was becoming 
busy, and a whole new city was growing up round their old tower, 
which was going to become a museum.  Later still he heard that she 
was not Stored after all, but had been picked up by the GSV turned 
Eccentric which had once been called the Quietly Confident, and 
which was now called the Sleeper Service.

~ Don't do this! 

~ I am determined. 

~ Well, at least let me get my avatar off! 

~ Take it. 

~ Thank you; beginning Displace sequence, the Fate Amenable To 
Change sent to the Appeal To Reason, and then continued: ~ Please; 
don't risk this. 

~ I am risking only the drone; in cognizance of your concerns I shall 
not remain in contact with it in-flight. 

~ And if it returns apparently unharmed, what will you do then? 

~ Take every reasonable precaution, including a stepped-intellect-
level throttled datastream-squirt approach, a- 

~ Sorry to interrupt, but don't tell me any more, in case our friend is 
listening in.  I appreciate the lengths you are prepared to go to try 

and ensure you remain free from contamination, but surely the point 
is that at any stage what you will find, or start to find, will look like 
the most valuable and interesting data available, and any intellectual 
restructuring suggested will look unambiguously like the most 
brilliant up-grade.  You will be taken before you know it; 
indeed, you will cease to be in a sense, unless your own automatic 
systems attempt to prevent the take-over, and that will surely lead 
to conflict. 

~ I shall resist ingesting any data requiring or suggesting either 
intellect restructuring or mimetic redrafting. 

~ That may not be enough.  Nothing may be enough. 

~ You are overly cautious, cousin, sent the Sober Counsel. ~ We are 
the Zetetic Elench.  We have ways of dealing with such matters.  Our 
experience is not without benefit, especially once we are fore-warned. 

~ And I am of the Culture, and I hate to see such risks being 
taken.  Are you sure you have the full agreement of your human 
crews concerning such a foolhardy attempt at contact? 

~ You know we have; your avatar sat in on the discussions, sent 
the Appeal To Reason. 

~ That was two days ago, the Fate Amenable To Change pointed out. 
~ You have just given a two-second launch notice; at least hold off 
long enough to carry out a poll of your humans and sentient drones 
and so ensure that they still agree with your proposed course of action 
now that the business is coming to a head.  After all, another few 
minutes or so is not going to make much difference, is it?  Think; I 
beg you.  You know humans as well as I do; things can take a while 
to sink in with them.  Perhaps some have only now finished thinking 
about the matter and have altered their position on it.  Please, as a 
favour, hold back a few minutes. 

~ Very well.  Reluctantly, but very well. 

The Appeal To Reason stopped the drone's launch countdown before 
a hundredth of a second had elapsed.  The Fate Amenable To 
Change stood down its Displacer and left its avatar aboard. 

It all made little difference.  The Fate Amenable To Change had 
secretly been upgrading its effectors over the past couple of days and 
had intended attempting to carry out its own subtle jeopardising of 
any drones dispatched towards the Excession, but it was not to have 
the chance.  Even while the hurriedly called vote was taking place on 
board the Appeal To Reason, the Fate received a message from 
another craft. 

oGCU Fate 
Amenable 
To 
Change (Culture) 

Greetings.  Please be advised I and my sister craft the Within 
Reason and Long View are also in attendance, just out of your 
primary scanner range.  We have reconfigured to an Extreme Offence 
back-up form and shall soon be joined by the two remaining ships of 
our fleet, similarly recast.  We would hope that you do not intend any 
interference with the plan our sister craft Appeal To Reason intends 
to effect. 

Shit, thought the GCU.  It had been reasonably confident it could 
either fool the two nearby Elench craft or just plain overpower their 
efforts to contact the Excession, but faced with five ships, three of 
them on a war footing, it knew it would never be able to prevail. 

It replied, saying that of course it intended no mischief, and glumly 
watched events unfold. 

The vote aboard the Appeal To Reason went the same way as before, 
though a few more humans did vote against the idea of sending the 
drone in than had the last time.  Two requested an immediate 
transfer to the Sober Counsel, then changed their minds; they would 
stay aboard.  The Fate took its avatars off both the Elencher ships.  It 
had used its heavy-duty displacer for the task, attenuating it to make 
it look as though it had utilised one of the lesser systems.  It left the 
unit running at full readiness. 

The Appeal To Reason's drone was duly launched; a small, fragile-
looking, gaily adorned thing, its extremities sporting ribεbons, 
flowers and little ornaments and its casing covered with drawings, 
cartoons and well-wishing messages scrawled by the crew.  It 
puttered hesitantly towards the Excession, chirpily beamεing signals 
of innocent goodwill. 

If the Fate Amenable To Change had been a human, at this point it 
would have looked down, put one hand over its eyes, and shake.n its 
head. 

The small machine took minutes to creep up to the seemingly 
unnoticing Excession's dull skein-surface; an insect crawling up to a 
behemoth.  It activated a short-range, one time hyperspace unit and 
disappeared from the skein as though passing through a mirror of 
dark fluid. 

In Infraspace, it… disappeared too, for an instant. 

The Fate Amenable To Change was watching the drone from a 
hundred different angles via its remotes.  They all saw it just 
disappear.  An instant later it reappeared.  It looped back through its 
little quantum burrow, returning to the skein of real space to start 
back, no less hesitantly, towards the Appeal To Reason. 

The Fate Amenable To Change crash-ramped its plasma chamεbers 
then isolated and readied a clutch of fusion warheads.  At the same 
moment, it signalled urgently. 

~ Was the drone meant to disappear that way? 

~ Hmm, sent the Appeal To Reason. ~ Well… 

~ Destroy it, the Fate urged. ~ Destroy it, now! 

~ It has communicated, slim-text only, as per instructions, 
the Appeal To Reason replied, sounding thoughtful, if wary. ~ It has 
gathered vast quantities of data on the entity.  There was a pause, 
then, excitedly; ~ It has located the mind-state of the Peace Makes 
Plenty! 

~ Destroy it!  Destroy it! 

~ No! sent the Sober Counsel. 

~ How can I? the Appeal To Reason protested. 

~ I'm sorry, the Fate Amenable To Change signalled to both the 
nearby craft, an instant after initiating a Displace sequence which 
flicked compressed spheres of plasma and a spray of fusion bombs 
down their own instantaneous wormholes towards the returning 
drone.

Ulver Seich tossed her damply tangled black hair over her shoulder 
and plonked her chin on Genar-Hofoen's chest.  She traced gentle 
circles round his left nipple with one finger; he put a sweaty arm 
round her slim back, drew her other hand to his mouth and delicately 
kissed her fingers, one by one.  She smiled. 

Dinner, talk, drink, shared smoke-bowl, agreeing fuzzy heads might 
be cleared by a dip in the Grey Area's pool, splashing, fooling 
around… and fooling around.  Ulver had been holding back a little for 
part of the evening until she'd been certain the man didn't just expect 
anything to happen, then when she'd convinced herself that he wasn't 
taking her for granted, that he liked her and that - after that awful 
time in the module - they did get on, that was when she'd suggested 
the swim. 

She raised her chin off his chest a little and flicked her finger back 
and forth over his tinily erect nipple. 'You were serious?' she asked 
him. 'An Affronter?' 

He shrugged. 'Seemed like a good idea at the time,' he said. 'I just 
wanted to know what it was like to be one of them.' 

'So now would you have to declare war on yourself?' she asked, 
pressing down on his nipple and watching it rise back up, her brows 
creased with concentration. 

He laughed. 'I suppose so.' 

She looked into his eyes. 'What about women?  You ever wonder the 
same?  You took the change once, didn't you?' She settled her chin 
back on his chest. 

He breathed in deeply, raising her head as though on an ocean 
swell.  He put one arm behind his head and stared up at the roof of 
her cabin. 'Yes, I did it once,' he said quietly. 

She smoothed her palm over his chest for a while, watching his skin 
intently. 'Was it just for her?' 

He craned his head up.  They looked at each other. 

'How much do you know about me?' he asked her.  He'd tried 
quizzing her over dinner on what she knew and why she'd been sent 
to Tier to intercept him, but she'd played mysterious (and, to be fair, 
he wasn't able to tell her exactly why he was on his way to 
the Sleeper Service). 

'Oh, I know all about you,' she said softly, seriously.  Then she looked 
down. 'Well, I know the facts.  I suppose that's not everything.' 

He lowered his head to the pillow again. 'Yes, it was just for her.' 

'Mm-hmm,' she said.  She continued to stroke his chest. 'You must 
have loved her a lot.' 

After a moment, he said, 'I suppose I must have.' 

She thought he sounded sad.  There was a pause, then he sighed 
again and, in a more cheerful voice, he said; 'What about you?  Ever 
a guy?' 

'No,' she said, with a laugh that might have held a trace of scorn. 
'Maybe one day.' She shifted a little and circled his nipple with the tip 
of her tongue for a moment. 'I'm having too much fun being a girl.' 

He reached down and pulled her up to kiss her. 

Then in the silence, a tiny chime sounded in the room. 

She broke off. 'Yes?' she said, breathing hard and scowling. 

'I'm very sorry to intrude,' said the ship, making no great effort to 
sound sincere. 'May I speak to Mr Genar-Hofoen?' 

Ulver made an exasperated noise and rolled off the man. 

'Good grief, can't it wait?' Genar-Hofoen said. 

'Yes, probably,' said the ship reasonably, as though this had just 
occurred to it. 'But people usually like to know this sort of thing 
immediately.  Or so I thought.' 

'What sort of thing?' 

'The sentient module Scopell-Afranqui is dead,' the ship told him. 'It 
conducted a limited destruct on the first day of the war.  We have 
only just heard.  I'm sorry.  Were you close?' 

Genar-Hofoen was silent for a moment. 'No.  Well… No.  Not that 
close.  But I'm sorry to hear it.  Thank you for telling me.' 

'Could it have waited?' the ship asked conversationally. 

'It could, but I suppose you weren't to know.' 

'Oh well.  Sorry.  Good night.' 

'Yes, good night,' the man said, wondering at his feelings. 

Ulver stroked his shoulder. 'That was the module you lived on, wasn't 
it?' 

He nodded. 'We never really got on,' he told her. 'Mostly my fault, I 
suppose.' He turned his head to look at her. 'I can be a scum-bag 
sometimes, frankly.' He grinned. 

'I'll take your word for it,' she said, climbing back on top of him. 

10. Heavy Messing 

I 

Grief, nothing worked!  The Fate Amenable To Change's ordnance 
directed at the Elench drone ship just disappeared, snatched away to 
nowhere; it had to react quickly to deal with the collapsing wormholes 
as they slammed back, now endless, towards its Displacers.  How 
could anything do that? (And had the watching Elench warships 
noticed?) The little Elench drone flew on, a few seconds away from 
its home ship. 

~ I confess I just tried to destroy your drone, the Fate sent to 
the Appeal To Reason. ~ I make no apologies.  Look what 
happened.  It enclosed a recording of the events. ~ Now will you 
listen?  There seems little point in trying to destroy the machine.  Just 
get away from it.  I'll try to work out another way of dealing with it. 

~ You had no business attempting to interfere with my drone, 
the Appeal To Reason replied. ~ I am glad that you were 
frustrated.  I am happy that the drone appears to be under the 
protection of the entity.  I take it as an encouraging sign that it is so. 

~ What? Are you mad? 

~ I'll thank you to stop impugning my mental state with such 
regularity and allow me to get on with my job.  I have not informed 
the other craft of your disgraceful and illegal attack on my drone; 
however, any further endeavours of a similar nature will not be 
treated so leniently. 

~ I shall not try to reason with you.  Goodbye and fare well. 

~ Where are you going? 

~ I am not going anywhere. 

II 

The General Contact Unit Grey Area was about to rendezvous with 
the General Systems Vehicle Sleeper Service. The GCU had gathered 
its small band of passengers in a lounge for the occasion; one of the 
ship's skeletal slave-drones joined them as they watched the view of 
hyperspace behind them on a wall screen.  The GCU was making the 
best speed it could, rushing beneath the skein at a little over forty 
kilolights on a gently, decreasingly curved course that was now 
almost identical to that of the larger craft approaching from astern. 

'This will require a coordinated full engine shut-off and Disεplace,' 
the small cube of components that was the drone told them. 'For an 
instant, none of us will be within my full control.' 

Genar-Hofoen was still trying to think of a cutting remark when the 
drone Churt Lyne said, 'Won't slow down for you, eh?' 

'Correct,' the slave-drone said. 

'Here it comes,' said Ulver Seich.  She sat cross-legged on a couch 
drinking a delicately scented infusion from a porcelain cup.  A dot 
appeared in the representation of space behind them; it rushed 
towards them, growing quickly.  It swelled to a fat shining ovoid that 
rushed silently underneath them; the view dipped quickly to follow it, 
beginning to perform a half-twist to keep the orientation correctly 
aligned.  Genar-Hofoen, standing near where Ulver sat, had to put 
his hand out to the back of the couch to steady himself.  In that 
instant, there was a sensation of a kind of titanically enveloping 
slippage, the merest hint of vast energies being gathered, cradled, 
unleashed, contained, exchanged and manipulated; unimaginable 
forces called into existence seemingly from nothing to writhe 
momentarily around them, collapse back into the void and leave 

Ulver Seich tssked as some of her infusion spilled into the cup's 
saucer. 

The view had changed.  Now it snapped to a grey-blue expanse of 
something curved, like a cup of cloud seen from the inside.  It pivoted 
again, and they were looking at a series of vast steps like the entrance 
to an ancient temple.  The broad shelves of the stairs led up to a 
rectangular entrance lined with tiny lights; a dark space beyond 
twinkled with still smaller lamps.  The view drew back to reveal a 
series of such entrances arranged side by side, the rest of which were 
closed.  Above and below, set into the faces of the steps, were 
smaller doors, all similarly shut. 

'Success,' the slave-drone said. 

The view was changing again as the ship was drawn slowly backwards 
towards the single opened bay. 

Genar-Hofoen frowned. 'We're going inside?' he asked the slave-
drone. 

It swivelled to face him, paused just long enough for the human to 
form the impression he was being treated like some sort of cretin. '… 
Well, yes…' it said, slowly, as one might to a particularly dim child. 

'But I was told-' 

'Welcome aboard the Sleeper Service,' said a voice behind 
them.  They turned to see a tall, angular, black-dressed creature 
walking into the lounge. 'My name is Amorphia.' 

III 

The drone returned to the Appeal To Reason and was taken back 
aboard.  Seconds passed. 

~ Well? the Fate Amenable To Change asked. 

There was a brief pause.  A microsecond or so.  Then: ~ It's empty, 
the Appeal To Reason sent. 

~ Empty? 

~- Yes.  It didn't record anything.  It's like it never went anywhere. 

~ Are you sure? 

~ Take a look for yourself. 

A data dump followed.  The Fate Amenable To Change shunted into 
a memory core it had set up for just such a purpose the mem it had 
realised what the Excession was, almost a month earlier.  It was the 
equivalent of a locked room, an isolation ward, a cell.  More 
information poured out of the Appeal To Reason; a gushing river of 
data trying to flood in after the original data dump.  The Culture ship 
ignored it.  Part of its Mind was listening to the howling, thumping 
noises coming out of that locked room. 

Information flickered between the Appeal To Reason and the Sober 
Counsel, an instant before the Fate sent its own warning signal.  It 
cursed itself for its procrastination, even if its warning would almost 
certainly have gone unheeded anyway. 

It signalled the distant, war-readied Elench craft instead, begging 
them to believe the worst had happened.  There was no immediεate 
reply. 

The Appeal To Reason was the nearer of the two Elencher ships.  It 
turned and started accelerating towards the Fate. It broadcast, tight-
beamed, lasered and field-pulsed vast, impossibly complicated 
signals at the Culture craft.  The Fate squirted back the contents of 
that locked room, evacuating it.  Then it swivelled and powered up 
its engines. So I am going somewhere, it thought, and moved off, 
away from the Appeal To Reason, which was still signalling wildly and 
remained on a heading taking it straight, for the Culture ship. 

The Fate raced outwards, powering away from the Elencher vessel 
and heading out on a great curve that would take it rolling over the 

invisible sphere that was the closest approach limit it had 
set.  The Sober Counsel was moving off on an opposite course from 
the Appeal To Reason, which was still following the Culture ship.  A 
direction which would turn into an intercept course if they all held 
these headings. Oh, shit, the Fate thought. 

They were still close enough to each other to just talk, but 
the Fate thought it ought to be a little more formal, so it signalled. 

oExplorer 
Ship Sober 
Counsel (Whoever) 

Whatever you are, if you advance on an intercept course on the far 
side of the closest approach limit, I'll open fire.  No further warnings. 

The Fate concentrated its attention on the last known locations of the 
three other Elench craft; the trio which the Break Even had said were 
all war-configured.  The other two couldn't be ignored, but the new 
arrivals had to constitute the greatest threat for now.  It scanned the 
data it had on the specifications of the Elench craft, calculating, 
simulating; war-gaming.  Grief, to be doing this with ships that were 
practically Culture ships!  The simulation runs came out equivocal.  It 
could easily deal with the two craft, even staying within range of the 
Excession (as though that was a wise limitation anyway!), but if the 
other three joined in the fun, and certainly if they attacked, it could 
well find itself in trouble. 

It signalled the Break Even again.  Still nothing. 

The Fate was starting to wonder what the point was of sticking 
around here.  The big guns would start arriving in a day or two; it 
looked like it was going to be in some sort of ludicrous continual chase 

with the two Elencher ships until then, which would be tiresome (with 
the possibility that the other three, war-ready Elencher ships might 
join in, which would be downright dangerous) and, after all, there 
was that war fleet on its way.  What more was it usefully going to be 
able to do here?  Certainly, it could keep a watch on the Excession, 
see if it did anything else interesting, but was that worth the risk of 
being overwhelmed by the Elench?  Or even by the Excession itself, 
if it was as invasive as it now appeared to be?  Enough of its drones, 
platforms and sensor platforms might be able to evade the Elenchers 
for the time it took until the other craft got here; they could keep 
watch on the situation, couldn't they? 

Ah, to hell with this, it thought to itself.  It dodged unexpectedly along 
the surface of the closest-approach limit, producing correεsponding 
alterations in the headings of the two Elencher ships.  It speeded up 
for a while, then slowed until it was stopped relative to the Excession. 

The position it held now was such that if you drew a line between the 
Excession and the direction it was expecting the MSV Not invented 
Here to arrive from, it would be on that line too. 

The Fate signalled the two Elencher ships once more, tryεing to get 
sense from the Appeal To Reason and any reply at all from the Sober 
Counsel. It was careful to target the last known positions of the Break 
Even and its two militarily configured sister ships as well, still trying 
to elicit a response.   None was forthcoming.  It waited until the last 
possible moment, when it looked like the Appeal To Reason was 
about to ram it in its enthusiasm to overwhelm it with signals, then 
broke away from it, heading straight out, directly away from the 
Excession. 

The Fate Amenable To Change's avatars began the task of telling the 
human crew what was happening.  Meanwhile the ship turned onto a 
course at a right-angle to its initial heading and powered away at 
maximum acceleration.  The Appeal To Reason targeted its effector 
on the fleeing Culture ship as it curved out trying to intercept it, but 
the attack - configured more as a last attempt to communicate - was 
easily fended off.  That wasn't what the Fate was concerned about. 

It watched that imaginary line from the Excession to the MSV Not 
Invented Here, focusing, magnifying its attention on that line's middle 
distance. 

Movement.  Probing filaments of effector radiations.  Three foci, 
clustered neatly around that line. 

The Elencher ship Break Even and its two militarily configured sister 
craft had been awaiting it. 

Congratulating itself on its perspicacity, the GCU headed on out, 
leaving the immediate vicinity of the Excession for the first time in 
almost a month. 

Then its engines stopped working.

'I was told,' Genar-Hofoen said in the traveltube, to the blank-faced 
and cadaverous ship's avatar, 'that I'd be off here in a day.  What do 
I need quarters for?' 

'We are moving into a war zone,' the avatar said flatly. 'There is a 
good chance that it will not be possible to off-load the Grey Area or 
any other ship between approximately sixteen and one hundred plus 
hours from now.' 

A deep, dark gulf of the Sleeper Service's cavernous interior space 
was briefly visible, sliding past, then the tube car zipped into another 
tunnel.  Genar-Hofoen stared at the tall, angular creature. 'You mean 
I might be stuck on here for four days?' 

'That is a possibility,' the avatar said. 

Genar-Hofoen glared at the avatar, hoping he looked as susεpicious 
as he felt. 'Well, why can't I stay on the Grey Area?' he asked. 

'Because it might have to leave at any moment.' 

The man looked away, swearing softly.  There was a war on, he 
supposed, but even so, this was typical SC.  First the Grey Area was 

allowed on board the Sleeper Service when he'd been told it wouldn't 
be, and now this.  He glanced back at the avatar, which was looking 
at 
him 
with 
what 
could 
have 
been 
curiosity 
or 
just 

gormlessness.  Four days on the Sleeper. He'd thought earlier, stuck 
on the module, that he'd be grateful when he could leave Ulver Seich 
and her drone behind on the GCU while he came aboard the Sleeper 
Service, but as it turned out, he wasn't. 

He shivered, and imagined that he could still feel Ulver's lips on his, 
from when they'd kissed goodbye, just a few minutes earlier.  The 
flash-back tremor passed. Wow, he thought to himself, and 
grinned. That was like being an adolescent again. 

Two nights, one day.  That was all he and Ulver had spent together 
as lovers.  It wasn't remotely long enough.  And now he'd be stuck 
aboard here for up to four nights. 

Oh well.  It could be worse; at least the avatar didn't look like it was 
the one he'd slept with.  He wondered if he was going to see Dajeil at 
all.  He looked at the clothes he was wearing, standard loose fatigues 
from the Grey Area. Wasn't this how he'd been dressed when he and 
Dajeil had last parted?  He couldn't recall.  Possibly.  He wondered at 
his own subconscious processes. 

The tube car was slowing; suddenly it was stopped. 

The avatar gestured to the door that rolled open.  A short corridor 
beyond led to another door.  Genar-Hofoen stepped into the corridor. 

'I trust you find your quarters acceptable,' he heard the avatar say 
quietly, behind him.  Then a soft rrrng noise and a faint draught on 
his neck made him look back in surprise.  The traveltube had gone, 
the transparent tube door was closed and the corridor behind him 
was empty' He looked about but there was nowhere the avatar could 
have gone.  He shrugged and continued on to the door ahead.  It 
opened onto a small lift.  He was in it for a couple of seconds, then 
the door rotated open and he stepped out, frowning, into a dimly lit 
space full of boxes and equipment that somehow looked vaguely 
familiar.  There was a strange scent in the air… The lift door snicked 

closed behind him.  He saw some steps over to one side in the gloom, 
set into a curved stone wall.  They really did look familiar. 

He thought he knew where he was.  He went to the steps and climbed 
them. 

He came up from the cellar into the short passageway which led to 
the main door on the ground storey of the tower.  The door was 
open.  He walked down the passageway to it and stood outside. 

Waves beat on the shining, sliding shingle of the beach.  The sun 
stood near noon.  One moon was visible, a pale eggshell half hidden 
in the fragile blueness of the sky.  The smell he'd recognised earlier 
was that of the sea.  Birds cried from the winds above him.  He 
walked down the slope of beach towards the water and looked 
about.  It was all pretty convincing; the space couldn't really be all 
that big - the waves were perhaps a little too uncomplicated, a little 
too regular, further out - but it certainly looked like you were seeing 
for tens of kilometres.  The tower was just the way he remembered 
it, the low cliffs beyond the salt marsh equally familiar. 

'Hello?' he called.  No answer. 

He pulled out his pen terminal. 'Very amusing…' he said, then 
frowned, looking at the terminal.  No tell-tale light.  He pressed a 
couple 
of 
panels 
to 
institute 
a 
systems 
check.  Nothing 

happened.  Shit. 

'Ah hah,' said a small, crackly voice behind him.  He turned to see a 
black bird, folding its wings on the shelf of stones behind him. 
'Another captive,' it cackled. 

V 

The Fate Amenable To Change let its engine fields race for a moment, 
running a series of tests and evaluation processes.  It was as if its 
traction fields were just sinking through the energy grid, as if it wasn't 
there.  It tried signalling, telling the outside universe of its plight, but 
the signals just seemed to loop back and it found itself receiving its 
own signal a picosecond after it had sent it.  It tried to create a warp 

but the skein just seemed to slide out of its fields.  It attempted 
Displacing a drone but the wormhole collapsed before it was properly 
formed.  It tried a few more tricks, finessing its field structures and 
reconfiguring its senses in an attempt at least to understand what 
was going on, but nothing worked. 

It thought.  It felt curiously composed, considering. 

It shut everything down and let itself drift, floating gradually back 
through the four-dimensional hypervolume towards the skein of real 
space, propelled by nothing more than the faint pressure of radiations 
expelled from the energy grid.  Its avatars were already starting to 
explain the change in the situation to its human crew.  The ship hoped 
the people would take it calmly. 

Then the Excession seemed to swell, bulging as though under an 
enormous lens, reaching out towards the Culture ship with a vast 
enclosing scoop of presence. 

Well, here we go, the ship thought. Should be interesting… 

VI 

'No.' 

'Please,' the avatar said. 

The woman shook her head. 'I've thought about it.  I don't want to 
see him.' 

The avatar stared at Dajeil. 'But I brought him all this way!' it cried. 
'Just for you!  If you knew…' Its voice trailed off.  It brought its feet 
up onto the front of the seat, and put its arms round its legs, hugging 
them. 

They were in Dajeil's quarters, inside another version of the tower's 
interior housed within the GCU Jaundiced Outlook.  The avatar had 
come straight here after leaving Genar-Hofoen in the Mainbay where 
the original copy of the tower - the one Dajeil Gelian had spent forty 
years living in - had been moved to when the ship had converted all 

its external spare mass to engine.  It had thought she would be 
pleased that the tower had not had to be destroyed, and that Genar-
Hofoen had finally been persuaded to return to her. 

Dajeil continued watching the screen.  It was a replay of one of her 
dives amongst the triangular rays in the shallow sea that was now no 
more, as seen from a drone which had accompanied her.  She 
watched herself move amongst the gracefully undulating wings of the 
great, gentle creatures.  Swollen, awkward, she was the only 
graceless thing in the picture. 

The avatar didn't know what to say next. 

The Sleeper Service decided to take over. 'Dajeil?' it said quietly, 
through its representative.  The woman looked round, recognising 
the new tone in Amorphia's voice. 

'What?' 

'Why don't you want to see him now?' 

'I…' she paused. 'It's just been too long,' she said. 'I think… I suppose 
for the first few years I did want to see him again; to… to-' she looked 
down, picking at her fingernails. '-I don't know.  Oh, to try and make 
things all right… grief, that sounds so lame.' She sniffed and looked 
upwards at the translucent dqme above her. 'I felt there were things 
we needed to have said that we never did say to each other, and that 
if we did get together, even for a little while, we could… work things 
out.  Draw a line under all that happened.  Tie up loose ends; that… 
that sort of thing.  You know?' she said, looking bright-eyed at the 
avatar. 

Oh, Dajeil, thought the ship. How wounded about the eyes. 'I know,' 
it said. 'But now you feel that too much time has passed?' 

The woman smoothed her hand over her belly.  She nodded slowly, 
looking at the floor. 'Yes,' she said. 'It's all too long ago.  I'm sure 
he's forgotten all about me.' She glanced up at the avatar. 

'And yet he is here,' it said. 

'Did he come to see me?' she asked it, already sounding bitter. 

'No, and yes,' the ship said. 'He had another motive.  But it is because 
of you he is here.' 

She shook her head. 'No,' she said. 'No; too much time…' 

The avatar unfolded itself from the seat and crossed to where Dajeil 
sat; it knelt down before her, and hesitantly extended one hand 
towards her abdomen.  Looking into her eyes, it gently placed its 
palm on Dajeil's belly.  Dajeil felt dizzy.  She could not recall 
Amorphia ever having touched her before, either under its own 
control or under the Sleeper Service's. She put her own hand on top 
of the avatar's.  The creature's hand was steady, soft and cool. 'And 
yet,' it said, 'in some ways, no time has passed.' Dajeil gave a bitter 
laugh. 'Oh yes,' she said. 'I've been here, doing nothing except 
growing older.  But what about him?' she asked and suddenly there 
was something fierce about her voice. 'How much has he lived in forty 
years?  How many loves has he had?' 

'I don't believe that signifies, Dajeil,' the ship told her quietly. 'The 
point is that he is here.  You can talk to him.  The two of you can 
talk.  Some resolution might be achieved.' It pressed very lightly on 
her belly. 'I believe it can be achieved.' 

She sighed heavily.  She looked down at her hand. 'I don't know,' she 
said. 'I don't know.  I need to think.  I can't… I need to think.' 

'Dajeil,' the ship said, and the avatar took her hand in both of its. 
'Were it possible, I would give you as long as you could desire, but I 
am not able to.  There is some urgency in this.  I have what might be 
termed an urgent appointment near a star called Esperi.  I cannot 
delay my arrival and I would not want to take you with me there; it 
is too dangerous.  I would like you to leave in this ship as soon as 
possible.' 

She looked hurt, the Sleeper thought. 

'I won't be forced into this,' she told it. 

'Of course not,' it said.  It attempted a smile and patted her hand. 
'Why not sleep on it?  Tomorrow will be soon enough.' 

VII 

The Attitude Adjuster watched the attacking craft fall amongst the 
founding shield of ships; they had no time to move more an 
fractionally from their original positions.  Their weaponry did their 
moving for them, focusing on the incoming target it plunged into their 
midst.  A scatter of brightly flaring missiles preceded the Killing Time, 
a hail of plasma bubbles accompanied it and CAM, AM and nanohole 
warheads cluster munitions burst everywhere around it like a gigantic 
firework, producing a giant orb of scintillations.  Many of the 
individual motes themselves detonated in a clustering hyperspherical 
storm of lethal sparks, followed sequentially by another and another 
echelon of explosions erupting amongst the wave of ships in a layered 
hierarchy of destruction. 

The Attitude Adjuster scanned the real-time reports coming back 
from its war flock.  One was caught by a nanohole, vanishing inside 
a vast burst of annihilation; another was damaged beyond immediate 
repair 
by 
an 
AM 
munition 
and 
dropped 
behind, 
engines 

crippled.  Fortuitously, neither were crewed by Affronters.  Most of 
the rest of the warheads were dealt with; the fleet's own replies were 
fended, detonated or avoided by the attacker.  No sign of the craft 
using its effectors to do more than cause interference; flittingly 
interrogating and probing amongst the collected mass of ships.  The 
focus of its attention had begun near the centre of the third wave of 
craft and was spirally erratically outwards, occasionally flicking 
further out towards the other waves. 

The Attitude Adjuster was puzzled.  The Killing Time was a Torturer 
class Rapid Offensive Unit.  It could be - it ought to be - devastating 
the fleet for these instants as it tore through it; it was capable of - 

Then it realised.  Of course.  It was a grudge. 

The Attitude Adjuster experienced a tingle of fear, merged with a kind 
of contempt.  The Killing Time's effector focus was a few ships away 
now, spiralling out towards the Attitude Adjuster. It signalled 

hurriedly to the five Rapid Offensive Units immediately around 
it.  Each listened, understood and obeyed.  The Killing Time's effector 
focus flicked from craft to craft, still coming closer. 

You fool, the Attitude Adjuster thought, almost angry at the attacking 
ship.  It was behaving stupidly, irresponsibly.  A Culture craft should 
not be so prideful.  It had thought the venom directed at itself by 
the Killing Time in its signal to it back at Pittance had been bluster; 
cheap 
bravado.  But 
it 
had 
been 
worse; 
it 
had 
been 

sincere.  Wounded self-esteem.  Upset that it personally had been 
subject to a ruse designed to destroy it.  As though its enemies cared 
an iota who it was. 

The Attitude Adjuster doubted this was an attack sanctioned by 
the Killing Time's peers.  This wasn't war, this was peevishness; this 
was taking it personally when, if there was anything war could be 
characterised as being, it was impersonal.  Idiot.  It deserved to 
perish.  It did not merit the honour it doubtless thought would accrue 
to it for this reckless and selfish act. 

The surrounding warships completed their changes.  Just in 
time.  When the attacking ship's effector targeted the first of those 
craft, the focus did not flit onto the next as it had with all the rest; 
instead it stayed, latching on, concentrating and strengthening.  The 
ROU caved in alarmingly quickly; the Attitude Adjuster guessed that 
it was made to reconfigure its engine fields to focus them inside its 
Mind - there was a sort of signalled shriek an instant before 
communication was lost - but the exact nature of its downfall was 
hidden in an accompanying shower of CAM warheads which 
obliterated it instantaneously.  A mercy; it would have been a grisly 
way for a ship to die. 

But too quick, thought the Attitude Adjuster; it was sure the attacker 
would have let the ROU - which the Killing Time had mistaken for 
the Attitude Adjuster - tear its intellect apart with its engines for 
longer if it had been totally fooled; the CAM dusting had been either 
a coup de grâce or a howl of frustration, perhaps both. 

The Attitude Adjuster signalled to the rest of the fleet, instructing 
them too to impersonate itself, but even as it watched the ROU which 

had been attacked alongside it disappear astern in a fragmenting 
cage of radiations, it began to be afraid. 

It had originally contacted the five nearest ships, hoping that the first 
one found and interrogated by the attacker's systems would fool 
the Killing Time into believing it had found the one ship it was 
obviously seeking. 

But that was stupid. It sensed the Torturer class ship's effectors 
sweep over the craft on the far side of the hole in the wave of ships 
which the ROU's destruction had created. 

Insufficient 
elapsed 
time, 
the Attitude 
Adjuster whispered 
to 

itself.  The ROU being quizzed at the moment was still reconfiguring 
its internal systems signature to resemble that of the Attitude 
Adjuster. The 
effector 
sweep 
flicked 
away 
from 
it, 

dismissing.  The Attitude Adjuster quailed. 

It had made itself a target!  It should have- HERE IT CAME! 

A feeling of- 

No, it had gone, swept over it!  Its own disguise had worked.  It had 
been dismissed too, like the ROU alongside! 

The 
effector 
focus 
jumped 
to 
another 
craft 
still 
further 

away.  The Attitude 
Adjuster was 
dizzy 
with 
relief.  It 
had 

survived!  The plan still held, the huge filthy trick they were pulling 
was free to continue! 

The way to the Excession lay open; the other Minds in the conspiracy 
would commend it if it survived; the-… but it mustn't think of the 
other ships involved.  It had to accept responsibility for what had 
happened.  It and it alone.  It was the traitor.  It would never reveal 
who had instigated this ghastly, gigadeathcrime-risking scheme; it 
had to assume the blame itself. 

It had wrestled with the Mind at Pittance and pressed it when it had 
insisted it would die rather than yield (but it had had no choice!); it 
had allowed the human on Pittance to be destroyed (but it had 

fastened its effector on his puny animal brain when it had seen what 
was happening to him; it had read the animal's brain-state, copied it, 
sucked it out of him before he'd died, so that at least he might live 
again in some form!  Look!  It had the file here… there it went…).  It 
had fooled the surrounding ships, it had lied to them, sent them 
messages from… from the ships it could not bear to think about. 

But it was the right thing to do! 

… Or was it just the thing it had chosen to believe was the right thing 
to do, when the other ships, the other Minds had persuaded it?  What 
had its real motives been?  Had it not just been flattered to be the 
object of such attention?  Had it not always resented being passed 
over for certain small but prestigious missions in the past, nursing a 
bitter resentment that it was not trusted because it was seen as being 
- what?  A hard-liner?  Too inclined to shoot first?  Too cynical 
towards the soft ideologies of the meat-beings?  Too mixed up in its 
feelings about its own martial prowess and the shaming moral 
implications of being a machine designed for war?  All those things, 
a little, perhaps.  But that wasn't all its fault!… And yet, did it not 
accept that one had an irreducible ethical responsibility for one's own 
actions?  It did.  And it accepted that and it had done terrible, terrible 
things.  All the attempts it had made to compensate had been eddies 
in the flood; tiny retrograde movements towards good entirely 
produced by the ferocious turbulence of its headlong rush to ill. 

It was evil. 

How simple that reductive conclusion seemed. 

But it had been obliged!… And yet it could not say by whom, so it had 
to accept the full responsibility for itself. 

But there were others!… And yet it could not identify them, and so 
the full weight of their distributed guilt bore down on the single point 
that was itself, unbearable, insupportable. 

But there were others!… And yet still it could not bear to think of 
them. 

And so somebody, some other entity, looking in from outside, say, 
would have to conclude, would it not, that perhaps these others did 
not really exist, that the whole thing, the whole ghastly abomination 
that was this plot was its idea, its own little conspiracy, thought up 
and executed by itself alone?  Was that not the case? 

But that was so unfair!  That wasn't true!… And yet, it could not 
release the identities of its fellow plotters.  Suddenly, it felt 
confused. Had it made them up? Were they real?  Perhaps it ought to 
check; open the place where they were stored and look at the names 
just to make sure that they were even the names of real Minds, real 
ships, or that it was not implicating innocent parties. 

But that was terrible!  Whichever way it fell after that, that was 
awful!  It hadn't made them up!  They were real!… But it couldn't 
prove it, because it just couldn't reveal them. 

Maybe it ought to just call the whole thing off.  Maybe it ought to 
signal all the other ships around it to break away, stop, retreat, or 
just open their comm channels so they could accept signals from 
other ships, other Minds, and be persuaded of the folly of their 
cause.  Let them make up their own minds.  They were intelligent 
beings no less than it.  What right had it to send them to their deaths 
on the strength of a heinous, squalid lie?  But it had to!… And yet, 
still, no; no it couldn't say who the others had been. 

It mustn't think of them!  And it couldn't possibly call off the 
attack!  It couldn't!  No!  NO!  Grief!  Meat!  Stop!  Stop it!  Let it 
go!  Sweet nothingness, anything was better than this wracking, 
tearing uncertainty, any horror preferable to the wrenching 
dreadfulness boiling uncontrollably in its Mind. 

Atrocity.  Abomination.  Gigadeathcrime. 

It was worthless and hateful, despicable and foul; it was wrung out, 
exhausted and incapable of revelation or communication.  It hated 
itself and what it had done more, much more than it had ever hated 
anything; more, it was sure, than anything had ever been hated in 
all existence.  No death could be too painful or protracted… 

And suddenly it knew what it had to do. 

It de-coupled its engine fields from the energy grid and plunged those 
vortices of pure energy deep into the fabric of its own Mind, tearing 
its intellect apart in a supernova of sentient agony. 

VIII 

Genar-Hofoen reappeared, exiting from the front door of the tower. 

'Up here,' croaked a thin, hoarse voice. 

He looked up and saw the black bird on the parapet.  He stood there 
watching it for a moment, but it didn't look like it was coming 
down.  He frowned and went back into the tower. 

He nodded. 'Locked,' he confirmed. 

The bird had insisted that he was a captive, along with it.  He'd 
thought maybe there was just something wrong with his terminal.  It 
had suggested he attempted to get out the way he had come in.  He'd 
just tried; the lift door in the tower's cellar was closed, and as solid 
and unmoving as the stones surrounding it. 

Genar-Hofoen leant back against the parapet, staring with a troubled 
expression at the tower's translucent dome.  He'd had a quick look at 
each of the levels as he'd climbed the winding stair.  The tower's 
rooms looked furnished and yet bare as well, all the personal stuff he 
and Dajeil had added to it missing.  It was like the original had been 
when they'd first arrived on Telaturier, forty-five years ago. 

'Told you.' 

'But why?' Genar-Hofoen asked, trying not to sound plainεtive.  He'd 
never even heard of a ship keeping somebody capεtive before. 

''Cause we're prisoners,' the bird told him, sounding oddly pleased 
with itself. 

'So you're not an avatar; you're not part of the ship?' 

'Na; I'm an independent entity, me,' the bird said proudly, spreading 
its feathers.  It turned its head almost right round, glancing 
backwards. 'Currently being followed by some bloody missile,' it said 
loudly. 'But never mind.' It rotated its head back to look at him. 'So 
what did you do to annoy the ship?' it asked, black eyes 
twinkling.  Genar-Hofoen got the impression it was enjoying his 
dismay. 

'Nothing!' he protested.  The bird cocked its head at him.  He blew 
out a breath. 'Well…' he looked around at where he was.  His brows 
flexed. 'Yes, well, from our surroundings, maybe the ship doesn't 
agree.' 

'Oh, this is nothing,' said the bird. 'This is just a Bay; just a hangar 
sort of thing.  Not even a klick long.  You should have seen the one 
outside, when we still had an outside.  Whole sea we had, whole sea 
and a whole atmosphere. Two atmospheres.' 

'Yes,' the man said. 'Yes, I heard.' 

'Sort of all for her, really.  Except it turned out its nibs had an ulterior 
motive, too.  All that stuff; became engine, you know.  But 
otherwise.  It was all for her, for all that time.' 

The man nodded.  It looked like he was thinking. 

'You're him, aren't you?' the bird said.  It sounded pleased with itself. 

'I'm who?' he asked. 

'The one that left her.  The one that was here, with her.  The real 
here, I mean.  The original here.' 

Genar-Hofoen looked away. 'If you mean Dajeil; yes, she and I lived 
in a tower like this one once, on an island that looked like this place.' 

'An-hah!' the bird said, jumping up and down and shaking its 
feathers. 'I see!  You're the bad guy!' 

Genar-Hofoen scowled at the bird. 'Fuck you,' he said. 

It cackled with laughter. 'That's why you're here!  Ho-ho; you'll be 
lucky to get off at all, you will!  Ha ha ha!' 

'And what did you do, arse-hole?' Genar-Hofoen asked the bird, more 
in the hope of annoying the creature than because he really cared. 

'Oh,' the bird said, drawing itself up and settling its feathers down in 
a dignified sort of way. 'I was a spy!' it said proudly. 

'A spy?' 

'Oh yes,' the bird said, sounding smug. 'Forty years I spent, listening, 
watching.  Reported back to my master.  Using the Stored ones who 
were going back.  Left messages on them.  Forty years and never 
once 
discovered.  Well, 
until 
three 
weeks 
ago.  Rumbled, 

then.  Maybe even before.  Can't tell.  But I did my best.  Can't ask 
better than that.' It started preening itself. 

The man's eyes narrowed. 'Who were you reporting back to?' 

'None of your business,' the bird said, looking up from its preening.  It 
took a precautionary couple of hop-steps backwards along the 
parapet, just to make sure it was well out of reach of the human. 

Genar-Hofoen crossed his arms and shook his head. 'What's this 
fucking crazy ship up to?' 

'Oh, it's off to see the Excession,' the bird said. 'At some lick, too.' 

'This thing at Esperi?' the man asked. 

'Heading straight for it,' the bird confirmed. 'What it told me, 
anyway.  Can't see why it'd lie.  Could be, I suppose.  Wouldn't put it 
past it.  But don't think it is.  Straight for it.  Has been for the past 
twenty-two days.  You want my opinion?  Going to give it you 

anyway.  I think it's stooping.' The creature put its head on one side. 
'Familiar with the term?' 

Genar-Hofoen nodded absently.  He didn't like the sound of this. 

'Stooping,' the bird repeated. 'If you ask me.  Thing's mad.  Been a 
bit loopy the last four decades.  Gone totally off the boulevard 
now.  In the hills and bouncing along full speed for the cliff 
edge.  That's my opinion.  And I've been round its loopiness for forty 
years.  I know, I do.  I can tell.  This thing's dafter than a jar of 
words.  I'm getting away on the Jaundiced Outlook, if it'll let me.  It 
being the Sleeper. Don't think the Jaundiced bears me any ill 
will.  Shouldn't think it does.  No.' Then, as though remembering a 
rich joke, it shook its head and said, 'The bad guy; ha!  You, on the 
other hand.  You'll be here forty years you will, chum.  If it doesn't 
wreck itself ramming this excession thing, that is.  Ha!  How'd it get 
you here anyway?  You come here to see old perpetually pregnant?' 

Genar-Hofoen looked momentarily stricken. 'It's true then; she never 
did have the child?' 

'Yep,' the bird said. 'Still in her.  Supposed to be hale and hearty, 
too.  If 
you 
can 
believe 
that.  So 
I 
was 
told.  Sounds 

unlikely.  Addled, I'd have thought.  Or turned to stone by now.  But 
there you are.  Either way, she just isn't having it.  Ha!' 

The man pinched his lower lip with his fingers, looking troubled. 

'What did you say brought you here?' the bird asked. 

It waited. 'Ahem!' it said loudly. 

'What?' the man asked.  The bird repeated the question. 

The man looked like he still hadn't heard, then he shrugged. 'I came 
here to talk to a dead person; a Storee.' 

'They've all gone,' said the bird. 'Hadn't you heard?' 

The man shook his head. 'Not one of the live ones,' he said. 
'Somebody without a bod, somebody who's Stored in the ship's 
memory.' 

'Na, they've gone too,' the bird said, lifting one wing to peck briefly 
underneath. 'Dropped them off at Dreve,' it continued. 'Complete 
download.  Upload.  Acrossload.  Whatever you call it.  Didn't even 
keep copies.' 

'What?' the man said, stepping towards the bird. 

'Seriously,' the creature said, taking a couple of hops backwards on 
the stonework of the parapet. 'Honest.' The man was staring at it 
now. 'No, really; so I was told.  I could have been misinformed.  Can't 
see why.  But it's possible.  Doubt it though.  They've gone.  That 
was my information.  Gone.  Ship said it didn't want even the copies 
aboard.  Just in case.' 

The man stared wildly at it for a bit longer. 'Just in case wbat?' he 
cried, stepping forward again. 

'Well, I don't know!' the bird yelped, hopping backwards and flexing 
its wings, ready to fly. 

Genar-Hofoen glared at the creature for a moment longer, then spun 
round, grasping the stones of the parapet with both hands and staring 
out into the false panorama of sea and cloud. 

IX 

Then it was in the wrong place.  As simple as that. 

The Fate 
Amenable 
To 
Change looked 
around, 

incredulous.  Stars.  Just stars.  Initially alien, in a way a starscape 
had never been before. 

This 
wasn't 
where 
it 
had 
just 
been.  Where 
was 
the 

Excession?  Where 
were 
the 
Elencher 
ships?  Where 
was 

Esperi?  Where was this? 

It 
called 
up 
from-scratch 
position-establishing 
routines 
no 

ship ever had to call up after they'd run through them in the very 
earliest part of their upbringing and self-fettling, in the Mind 
equivalent of infancy.  You did this sort of thing once to show the 
Minds supervising your development you could do it, then you forgot 
about it, because nobody ever lost track of where they were, not over 
this magnitude of scale.  And yet here it was having to do just 
that.  Quite bizarre. 

It looked at the results.  There was something almost viscerally 
relieving about the discovery that it was still in the same 
universe.  For a moment it had been contemplating the prospect of 
finding itself in a different one altogether. (At the same time, at least 
one part of its intellect experienced a corresponding flicker of 
disappointment for exactly the same reason.) 

It was nowhere near Esperi.  Its position was thirty light years away 
from where it had been, apparently, a moment ago.  The nearest star 
system was an undistinguished red-giant/blue-white dwarf double 
called Pri-Etse.  The binary lay roughly along that same imaginary 
straight line that joined the Excession to the incoming MSV Not 
Invented Here. Where the ship itself had ended up was even closer 
to that imaginary line. 

The Fate checked itself over.  Unharmed.  Uninvaded, unjeopar-
dised, uncontacted. 

It replayed those last few picoseconds while it multiple-checked its 
systems. 

…  The Excession rushed out to meet it.  It was enveloped in - 
what?  Skein fabric?  Some sort of ultradense field?  It all happened 
at close to hyperspace-light speeds.  The outside universe was 
pinched off and in the following moment there was an instant of 
nothing; no external input whatsoever, a vanishingly minute, 
perfectly indivisible fraction of a picosecond when the Fate was cut 
off from everything; no outside sensor data whatsoever.  Events 
within the ship itself had continued as normal (or rather its internal 
state had remained the same for that same infinitesimally 
microscopic instant- there had been no time for anything appreciable 

to actually happen). In its Mind, there had been time for the 
hyperspatial quanta-equivalents to alter their states for a few cycles; 
so time had still elapsed. 

But outside; nothing. 

Then the skein or field substrate had vanished, snapping out of 
existence to precisely nowhere, disappearing too quickly for the ship's 
sensors to register where it had gone. 

The Fate replayed that section of its records slower and slower until 
it was dealing with the equivalent of individual frames; the smallest 
possible sub-division of perception and cognizance the Culture or any 
other Involved knew of. 

And it came down to four frames; four snapshots of recent history.  In 
one frame the Excession seemed to be rushing out, accelerating out 
to meet it, in the next the skein/field had wrapped itself almost totally 
around the ship - at a distance of perhaps a kilometre from ship-
centre, though it was hard to estimate -leaving only a tiny hole 
staring out to the rest of the universe on the opposite side of the ship 
from the Excession, in the third frame the total cut-off from the 
universe was in place, and in the next it had gone, and the Fate had 
moved, or had been moved, thirty light years in less than a 
picosecond. 

How the fuck does it do that? the ship wondered.  It started checking 
that time was still working properly, directing its sensors at distant 
quasars which had been used as time reference sources for 
millennia.  It also started checking that it was not in the centre of 
some huge projection, extending its still-stopped engine fields like 
vast whiskers, feeling for the (as far as anybody knew) unfakeable 
reality that was the energy grid and minutely - and randomly - 
scrutinising sections of the view around it, searching for the 
equivalent of pixels or brush strokes.  The Fate Amenable To 
Change was experiencing a sense of elation at having survived what 
it had feared might be a terminal encounter with the Excession.  But 
it was still worried that it had missed something, that it had been 
interfered with somehow.  The most obvious explanation was that it 
had been fooled, that it had been tricked into moving itself here under 

its own power or been moved to this position via another tractive 
force over time.  The further implication was that the interval when it 
had been moving had somehow been expunged from its 
memory.  That would be bad.  The very idea that its Mind was not 
absolutely inviolate was anathema to a ship. 

It tried to accustom itself to the idea that this was what had 
happened.  It tried to steel itself to the prospect that - at the very 
least - it would have to have its mental processes investigated by 
other Minds to establish whether it had suffered any lasting damage 
or had had any unpleasant sub-routines (or even personalities) buried 
in its mind-state during the time it had been - effectively - 
unconscious (horrible, horrible thought). 

The check-time results started coming in. 

Relief and incredulity.  If this was the real universe and not a 
projection, or - worse still - something it had been persuaded to. 
imagine for itself inside its Mind, then there had been no extra 
elapsed time.  The universe thought it was exactly the same time as 
the Mind's internal clock did. 

The ship felt stunned.  Even while another part of its intellect, an opt-
in, semi-autonomous section, was restarting its engines and 
discovering they worked just fine, the ship was trying to come to 
terms with the fact it had been moved thirty light years in an 
instant.  No Displacer could do that.  Not with something the size it 
was, not that quickly, not over that sort of distance.  Certainly not 
without even the merest hint that a wormhole had been involved. 

Unbelievable. I'm in a fucking Outside Context situation, the ship 
thought, and suddenly felt as stupid and dumb-struck as any muddy 
savage confronted with explosives or electricity. 

It sent a signal to the Not Invented Here. Then it tried contacting its 
remotes still - presumably - in station around the Excession.  No 
reply.  And no sign of the Elencher ships either.  Anywhere. 

The Excession was invisible too, but then it would be from this 
distance. 

The Fate nudged itself tentatively towards the Excession.  Almost 
immediately, its engines started to lose traction, their energies just 
seeming to disappear through the energy grid as though it wasn't 
there.  It was a progressive effect, worsening as it proceeded and 
with the implication that about a light minute or so further in towards 
the Excession it would lose grid adhesion altogether. 

It had only progressed about ten light seconds in; it slowed while it 
still could and backed up until it was the same distance away from 
the Excession as it had been when it had found itself dumped here in 
the first place.  Once it was there, its engines responded perfectly 
normally again. 

It had made the initial attempt in Infraspace; it tried again in 
Ultraspace, with exactly the same result.  It went astern once more 
and resumed its earlier position.  It tried moving at a right angle to 
its earlier course; the engines worked as they always did.  Weird.  It 
hove to again. 

Its avatars amongst the crew started yet another explanation 
regarding what was going on.  It compiled a preparatory report and 
signalled it to the MSV Not Invented Here. The report crossed with 
the MSVs reply to the Fate's earlier signal: 

oGCU Fate

Thereby hangs a tale.  But in the meantime I'd slow down if I were

X 

The rest of that day passed, and the following night.  The black bird, 
which had said its name was Gravious, had flown off, saying it was 
tired of his questions. 

The next morning, after checking that his terminal still did not work 
and the lift door in the cellar remained locked and unresponding, 
Genar-Hofoen walked as far along the shingle beach as he could in 
each direction; a few hundred steps in each case, before he 
encountered a gelatinously resilient field.  The view beyond looked 
perfectly convincing, but must be a projection.  He discovered a way 
through part of the salt marsh and found a similar force field wall a 
hundred steps into the hummocks and little creeks.  He came back to 
the tower to wash his boots free of the authentically fine and clinging 
mud he'd had to negotiate on his way through the salt marsh.  There 
was no sign of the black bird he'd talked to the day before. 

The avatar Amorphia was waiting for him, sitting on the shelf of 
shingle beach sloping down to the restive sea, hugging its legs and 
staring out at the water. 

He stopped when he saw it, then came on.  He walked past it and into 
the tower, washed his boots and came back out.  The creature was 
still there. 

'Yes?' 
he 
said, 
standing 
looking 
down 
at 
it.  The 
ship's 

repreεsentative rose smoothly up, all angles and thin limbs.  Close 
up, in that light, there was a sort of unmarked, artless quality about 
its thin, pale face; something near to innocence. 

'I want you to talk to Dajeil,' the creature said. 'Will you?' 

He studied its empty-looking eyes. 'Why am I being kept here?' 

'You are being kept because I would like you to talk to Dajeil.  You 
are being kept here because I thought this… model would be 

conducive to putting you in the mood to talk to her about what passed 
between you forty years ago.' 

He frowned.  Amorphia had the impression the man had a lot more 
questions, all jostling each other to be the first one asked.  Eventually 
he said, 'Are there any mind-state Storees left on the Sleeper 
Service? 

'No,' the avatar said, shaking its head. 'Does this refer to the ruse 
that brought you here?' 

The man's eyes had closed briefly.  They opened again. 'Yes, I 
suppose so,' he said.  His shoulders seemed to have slumped, the 
avatar thought. 'So,' he asked, 'did you make up the story about 
Zreyn Enhoff Tramow, or did they?' 

The avatar looked thoughtful. 'Gart-Kepilesa Zreyn Enhoff Tramow 
Afayaf dam Niskat,' it said. 'She was a mind-state Storee.  There's 
quite an interesting story associated with her, but not one I ever 
suggested be told to you.' 

'I see,' he said, nodding. 'So, why?' he asked. 

'Why what?' the creature said, looking puzzled. 

'Why the ruse?  Why did you want me here?' 

The avatar looked at him for a moment. 'You're my price, Genar-
Hofoen,' it told him. 

'Your price? he said. 

The avatar smiled suddenly and put out one hand to touch one of 
his.  Its touch was cool and firm. 'Let's throw stones,' it said.  And 
with that it walked down towards the waves breaking on the slope of 
shingle. 

He shook his head and followed the creature. 

They stood side by side.  The avatar looked along the great sweep of 
shining, spray-glistened stones. 'Every one a weapon,' it muttered, 

then stooped to pick a large pebble from the beach and threw it 
quickly, artlessly out at the heaving waves.  Genar-Hofoen selected 
a stone too. 

'I've been pretending to be Eccentric for forty years, Genar-Hofoen,' 
the avatar said matter-of-factly, squatting again. 

'Pretending?' the man asked, chucking the stone on a high arc.  He 
wondered if it was possible to hit the far force wall.  The stone fell, 
vanishing into the tumbling 'scape of waves. 

'I have been a diligent and industrious component of the Special 
Circumstances section for all that time, just awaiting the call,' the 
ship told him through the avatar.  It glanced over at him as he bent, 
choosing another stone. 'I am a weapon, Genar-Hofoen.  A deniable 
weapon.  My apparent Eccentricity allows the Culture proper to refuse 
any responsibility for my actions.  In fact I am acting on the specific 
instructions of an SC committee which calls itself the Interesting 
Times Gang.' 

The creature broke off to heave a stone towards the false horizon.  Its 
arm was a blur as it threw; the air made a burring noise and Genar-
Hofoen felt the wind of the movement on his cheek.  The avatar's 
momentum spun it round in a circle, then it steadied itself, gave a 
brief, almost childish grin, and peered out at the stone disappearing 
into the distance.  It was still on the upward part of its arc.  Genar-
Hofoen watched it too.  Shortly after it started to drop, the stone 
bounced off something invisible and fell back into the waters.  The 
avatar made a contented noise and looked pleased with itself. 

'However,' it said, 'when it came to it, I refused to do what they 
wanted until they delivered you to me.  That was my price.  You.' It 
smiled at him. 'You see?' 

He weighed a stone in his hand. 'Just because of what happened 
between Dajeil and me?' 

The avatar smiled, then stooped to choose another stone, one finger 
to its lips, childlike.  It was silent for a while, apparently concentrating 
on the task.  Genar-Hofoen continued to weigh the stone in his hand, 

looking down at the back of the avatar's head.  After some moments, 
the creature said, 'I was a fully functioning throughput-biased Culture 
General Systems Vehicle for three hundred years, Genar-Hofoen.' It 
glanced up at him. 'Have you any idea how many ships, drones, 
people - human and not human - pass through a GSV in all that time?' 
It looked down again, picked a stone and levered itself upright once 
more. 'I was regularly home to over two hundred million people; I 
could, in theory, hold over a hundred thousand ships.  I built smaller 
GSVs, all capable of building their own ship children, all with their 
own crews, their own personalities, their own stories. 

'To be host to so much is to be the equivalent of a small world or a 
large state,' it said. 'It was my job and my pleasure to take an 
intimate interest in the physical and mental well-being of every 
individual aboard, to provide 
- with every appearance of 

effortlessness - an environment they would each find comfortable, 
pleasant, stress-free and stimulating.  It was also my duty to get to 
know those ships, drones and people, to be able to talk to them and 
empathise with them and understand however many of them wished 
to indulge in such interactions at any one time.  In such 
circumstances you rapidly develop, if you don't possess it originally, 
an interest in - even a fascination with - people.  And you have your 
likes and dislikes; the people you do the polite minimum for and are 
glad to see the back of, the ones you like and who interest you more 
than the others, the ones you treasure for years and decades if they 
remain, or wish could have stayed longer once they've gone and 
subsequently correspond with regularly.  There are some stories you 
follow up into the future, long after the people concerned have left; 
you trade tales with other GSVs, other Minds - gossiping, basically - 
to find out how relationships turned out, whose careers flourished, 
whose dreams withered…' 

Amorphia leant back and over and then threw the stone almost 
straight up.  The creature jumped a half-metre or so into the air as it 
released the missile, which climbed on into the air until it bounced off 
the invisible roof, high above, and fell into the waves twenty metres 
off shore.  The avatar clapped its hands once, seemingly happy. 

It stooped again, surveying the pebbles. 'You try to keep a balance 
between indifference and nosiness, between carelessness and 
obsession,' it went on. 'Still, you have to be ready for accusations of 
both types of failure.  Keeping them roughly in numerical accord, and 
within the range experienced by your peers is one measure of 
success.  Perfection is impossible.  Additionally, you have to accept 
that in such a large collection of personalities and stories, there will 
be some loose ends, some tales which will fizzle out rather than 
conclude neatly.  Those don't matter so long as there are some which 
do work out satisfactorily, and especially so long as the ones you have 
taken the greatest interest in - and have been personally particularly 
involved with - work out.' 

It looked up at him from where it squatted. 'Sometimes you take a 
hand in such stories, such fates.  Sometimes you know or can 
anticipate the extent to which your intervention will matter, but on 
other occasions you don't know and can't guess.  You find that some 
chance remark you've made has affected somebody's life profoundly 
or that some seemingly insignificant decision you've come to has had 
profound and lasting consequences.' 

It shrugged, looked down at the stones again. 'Your story - yours and 
Dajeil's - was one a little like that,' it told him. 'It was who was 
instrumental in deciding that you ought to be allowed to accompany 
Dajeil Gelian to Telaturier,' it said, rising.  It held two stones this 
time; one larger than the other. 'I could see how finely balanced the 
decision was between the various parts of the committee concerned; 
I knew the decision effectively rested with me.  I got to know you and 
I made the decision.' It shrugged. 'It was the wrong decision.' It threw 
the larger stone on a high trajectory, then looked back at the man as 
it hefted the smaller stone. 'I've spent the last forty years wishing I 
could correct my mistake.' It turned and threw the other pebble low 
and fast; the stone flew out over the waves and struck the larger rock 
about two metres before it plunged into the water; they burst into 
whizzing fragments and a brief cloud of dust. 

The avatar turned to him again with a small smile on its face. 'I 
agreed to pretend to become Eccentric; suddenly I had a freedom 
very few craft ever have, able to indulge my whims, my fantasies, 

my own dreams.' It flexed one eyebrow. 'Oh, in theory, of course, we 
can all do that, but Minds have a sense of duty, and a conscience.  I 
was able to become very slightly Eccentric by pretending to be very 
Eccentric - while knowing that I was in fact being more martially 
responsible than anybody else - and, in appearing to enjoy such 
Eccentricity with a clear conscience -even enhance my Eccentric 
reputation.  Other craft looked on and thought that they could do 
what I was doing but not for long, and therefore that I must be 
thoroughly thoroughly weird.  As far as I know, not one guessed that 
my conscience was kept clear by having a purpose serious enough to 
compensate for even the most clown-like disguise and regressively 
obsessive behaviour.' 

It folded its arms. 'Of course,' it said, 'you don't normally expect to 
be continually reminded of your folly every day for four decades, but 
that was the way it was to be.  I didn't anticipate that at the start, 
though it became a useful and fit part of my Eccentricity.  I picked 
Dajeil up a short while into my internal exile.  She was the single last 
significant loose end from my previous life.  All the other stories didn't 
concern me so directly, or bore no similar weight of responsibility, or 
were well on the way to being satisfactorily resolved or decently 
forgotten through the due process of time elapsing and people 
changing.  Only Dajeil remained; my responsibility.' The avatar 
shrugged. 'I had hoped to talk her round, to cause her to accept 
whatever it was had happened to you both and get on with the rest 
of her life.  Bearing the child would-be the signal that she was 
mended; that labour would be the end of her travails, that birth mark 
an end.' The avatar looked away, out to sea for a moment, a frown 
creasing its brows. 'I thought it would be easy,' it said, looking back 
at him. 'I was so used to power, to being able to influence people, 
ships and events.  It would have been such a simple thing even to 
have tricked her body into giving birth - I could have started the 
process chemically or via an effector while she was asleep and by the 
time she was awake there would have been no going back- that I was 
sure my arguments, my reasoning - grief, even my cherished facility 
at emotional blackmail - would find scarcely more of an obstacle in 
her will than all my technologies could face in her physiology.' 

It shook its head quickly. 'It was not to be. She proved intransigent.  I 
hoped to persuade her - to shame her, indeed- by the very totality of 
my concern for her, re-creating all you see here,' the avatar said, 
glancing round at the cliffs, marsh, tower and waters, 'for real; 
turning my entire outer envelope into a habitat just for her and the 
creatures she loved.' Amorphia gave a sort of dipping sideways nod, 
and smiled. 'I admit I had another purpose as well, which such 
exaggerated compassion would only help disguise, but the fact is my 
original design was to create an environment she would feel 
comfortable within and into which she would feel safe bringing her 
baby, having seen the care I was prepared to lavish just on her.' The 
avatar gave a rueful smile. 'I got it wrong,' it admitted. 'I was wrong 
twice and each time I harmed Dajeil.  You are - and this is - my last 
chance to get it right.' 

'And what am I supposed to do?' 

'Why, just talk to her!' the avatar cried, holding its arms out (and, 
suddenly, Genar-Hofoen was reminded of Ulver). 

'What if I won't play along?' he asked. 

'Then you may get to share my fate,' the ship's representative told 
him breezily. 'Whatever that may be.  At any rate, I may keep you 
here until you do at least agree to talk to her, even if - for that 
meeting to take place - I have to ask her to return after I've sent her 
away to safety.' 

'And what is likely to be your fate?' 

'Oh, death, possibly,' the avatar said, shrugging with apparent 
unconcern. 

The man shook his head. 'You haven't got any right to threaten me 
like that,' he said, with a sort of half-laugh in his voice he hoped didn't 
sound as nervous as he felt. 

'Nevertheless, I am threatening you like that, Genar-Hofoen,' the 
avatar said, bending at the waist to lean towards him for a moment. 
'I am not as Eccentric as I appear, but consider this: only a craft that 

was predisposed to a degree of eccentricity in the first place would 
have taken on the style of life I did, forty years ago.' The creature 
drew itself upright again. 'There is an Excession without precedent at 
Esperi which may lead to an infinitude of universes and a level of 
power orders of magnitude beyond what any known Involved 
currently possesses.  You've experienced the way SC works, Genar-
Hofoen; don't be so naive as to imagine that Minds don't employ 
strong-arm methods now and again, or that in a matter resounding 
with such importance any ship would think twice about sacrificing 
another consciousness for such a prize.  My information is that 
several Minds have been forfeited already; if, in the exceptional 
conditions prevailing, intellects on that scale are considered fair 
game, think about how little a single human life is likely to matter.' 

The man stared at the avatar.  His jaw was clenched, his fists balled. 
'You're doing this for a single human life,' he said. 'Two, if you count 
the fetus.' 

'No, Genar-Hofoen,' the avatar said, shaking its head. 'I'm doing this 
for myself, because it's become an obsession.  Because my pride will 
not now let me settle this any other way.  Dajeil, in that sense, and 
for all her self-lacerating spite, has won.  She forced you to her will 
forty-five years ago and she has bent me to hers for the last 
forty.  Now more than ever, she has won.  She has thrown away four 
decades of her life on a self-indulgent sulk, but she stands to gain by 
her own criteria.  You have spent the last forty years enjoying and 
indulging yourself, Genar-Hofoen, so perhaps you could be said to 
have won by your criteria, and after all you did win the lady at the 
time, which was all you then wanted, remember?  That was your 
obsession.  Your folly.  Well, the three of us are all paying for our 
mutual and intermingled mistakes.  You did your part in creating the 
situation; all I'm asking is that you do your part in alleviating it.' 

'And all I have to do is talk to her?' The man sounded sceptical. 

The creature nodded. 'Talk.  Try to understand, try to see things from 
her perspective, try to forgive, or allow yourself to be forgiven.  Be 
honest with her and with yourself.  I'm not asking you to stay with 
her or be her partner again or form a family of three; I just want 
whatever it is that has prevented her from giving birth to be identified 

and ameliorated; removed if possible.  I want her to resume living 
and her child to start.  You will then be free to return to your own 
life.' 

The man looked out to sea, then at his right hand.  He looked 
surprised to see he was holding a stone in it.  He threw it as hard and 
as far as he could into the waves; it didn't travel half the distance to 
the distant, invisible wall. 

'What are you supposed to do?' the man asked the creature. 'What is 
your mission?' 

'Get to the Excession,' Amorphia said. 'Destroy it, if that's deemed 
necessary, and if it's possible.  Perhaps just draw a response from it.' 

'And what about the Affront?' 

'Added complication,' the avatar agreed, squatting once more and 
looking around the stones around its feet. 'I might have to deal with 
them too.' It shrugged, and lifted a stone, hefting it.  It put the stone 
back and chose another. 

'Deal with them?' Genar-Hofoen said. 'I thought they had an entire 
war fleet heading there.' 

'Oh, they do,' the avatar said from beach level. 'Still, you have to try, 
don't you?' It stood again. 

Genar-Hofoen looked at it, trying to see if it was being ironic or just 
disingenuous.  No way of telling. 'So when do we get into the thick of 
things?' he asked, trying to skip a flat stone over the waves, without 
success. 

'Well,' Amorphia said, 'the thick of things probably starts about thirty 
light years out from the point of the Excession itself, these days.' The 
avatar stretched, flexing its arm far back behind it. 'We should be 
there this evening,' it said.  Its arm snapped forward.  The stone 
whistled through the air and skipped elegantly over the tops of half a 
dozen waves before disappearing. 

Genar-Hofoen turned and stared at the avatar.  'This evening? he 
said. 

'Time is a httle tight,' the avatar said with a pained expression, again 
peering into the distance. 'It would be for the best for all of us lf you'd 
talk to Dajeil… soon.' It smiled vacuously at him. 

'Well, how about right now?' the man said, spreading his hands. 

'I'll see,' the creature said, and turned abruptly on its heel.  Suddenly 
there was a reflecting ovoid, like a giant silver egg stood on its end, 
where the avatar had been.  The Displacer field vanished almost 
before the man had time to register its existence, seeming to shrink 
and collapse almost instantly to a point and then disappearing 
altogether.  The process produced a gentle pop. 

XI 

The Killing Time plunged intact through the third wave of ancient 
Culture ships; they rushed on, towards the Excession.  It fended off 
a few more of the warheads and missiles which had been directed at 
it, turning a couple of the latter back upon their own ships for a few 
moments before they were detected and destructed.  The hulk of 
the Attitude Adjuster fell astern behind the departing fleet, coasting 
and twisting and tumbling in hyperspace, still heading away from and 
outstripping the Killing Time as it braked and started to turn. 

There was only a vestigial fourth wave; fourteen ships (they were 
targeting it now).  Had it known there were so few in the final 
echelon, the Killing Time would have attacked the second wave of 
ships.  Oh well; luck counted too.  It watched the Attitude Adjuster a 
moment longer to ensure it really was tearing itself apart.  It was. 

It turned its attention to the remaining fourteen craft.  On its suicide 
trajectory it could take them all on and stand a decent chance of 
destroying perhaps four of them before its luck ran out; maybe a half-
dozen if it was really lucky.  Or it could push away and complete its 
brake-turn-accelerate manoeuvre to make a second pass at the main 
fleet.  Even if they'd be waiting for it this time, it could reckon on 
accounting for a good few of them.  Again, in the four-to-eight range. 

Or it could do this. 

It pulled itself round the edge of the fourteen ships in the rump of the 
fleet as they reconfigured their formation to meet it.  Bringing up the 
rear they had had more warning of its attack and so had had time to 
adopt a suitable pattern.  The Killing Time ignored the obvious 
challenge and temptation of flying straight into their midst and flew 
past and round, targeting only the outer five craft nearest it. 

They gave a decent account of themselves but it prevailed, 
dispatching two of them with engine field implosures.  This was, it 
had always thought, a clean, decent and honourable way to die.  The 
pair of wreckage-shells coasted onwards; the rest of the ships sped 
on unharmed, chasing the main fleet.  Not one of the ships turned 
back to take it on. 

The Killing Time continued to brake, oriented towards the fast 
vanishing war fleet and the region of the Excession.  Its engine fields 
were gouging great livid tracks in the energy grid as it back-pedalled 
furiously. 

It encountered the ROU which had dropped aft with engine damage, 
falling back towards it as the Killing Time slowed and the other craft 
coasted onward and struggled to repair its motive power 
units.  The Killing Time attempted to communicate with the ROU, was 
fired upon, and tried to take the craft over with its effector.  The 
ROU's own independent automatics detected the ship's Mind starting 
to give in.  They tripped a destruct sequence and another 
hypersphere of radiation blossomed beneath the skein. 

Shit, thought the Killing Time. It scanned the hyper volumes around 
itself. 

Nothing threatening. 

Well, damn me, it thought, as it slowed. I'm still alive. 

This was the one outcome it hadn't anticipated. 

It ran a systems check.  Totally unharmed, apart from the self-
inflicted degradation to its engines.  It slackened off the power, 
dropping back to normal maxima and watching the readouts; 
significant degradation from here in about a hundred hours.  Not too 
bad.  Self-repairing would take days at all-engines-stop.  Warhead 
stocks down to forty per cent; remanufacturing from first principles 
would take four to seven hours, depending on the exact mix it 
chose.  Plasma chambers at ninety-six per cent efficiency; about right 
for the engagement system-use profile according to the relevant 
charts and graphs.  Self-repair mechanisms champing the bit.  It 
looked around, concentrating on the view astern.  No obvious 
threats; it let the self-repairers make a start on two of the four 
chambers.  Full reconstruction time, two hundred and four seconds. 

Entire engagement duration; eleven microseconds.  Hmm; it had felt 
longer.  But then that was only natural. 

Should it make a second pass?  It pondered this while it signalled 
the Shoot Them Later and a couple of other distant Minds with details 
of the engagement.  Then it copied to the Steely Glint, withεout 
leaving the comm channels open.  It needed time to think. 

It felt excited, energised, re-purified by the engagement it had 
undergone.  Its appetite was whetted.  A further pass would be no-
holds-barred multi-destructional, not a series of semi-defensive side-
actions while it concentrated on searching for one individual 
ship.  This next time it could really get nasty… 

On the other hand, it had inflicted a more than reasonable amount of 
damage on the fleet for no ship-loss whatsoever and a barely 
significant degradation to its operational capacity.  It had ignored the 
advice of a superior Mind in wartime but it had triumphed.  It had 
gambled and won and there was a kind of unexpected elegance in 
cashing in its gains now.  To pursue the matter further might look like 
obsessive self-regard, like ultra-militarism, especially now that the 
original object of its ire had been bested.  Perhaps it would be better 
to accept whatever praise and/or calumny might now be heaped upon 
it and re-submit itself to the jurisdiction of the Culture's war-
command structure (though it was starting to have its doubts about 
the part of the Steely Glint in all this). 

It drew level with the debris clouds left by the two ships destroyed in 
the final wave of the war fleet.  It let them drop astern. 

The wreck of the Attitude Adjuster came tumbling slowly towards it 
in hyperspace; coasting, slowing, drifting gradually back up towards 
the skein.  Externally, it looked unharmed. 

The Killing Time slowed to keep pace with the slackly somerεsaulting 
craft.  It probed the Attitude Adjuster carefully with its senses, its 
effector targeted on the other ship's Mind, ready on the instant.  In 
human terms, this was like taking somebody's pulse while keeping a 
gun stuck in their mouth. 

The Attitude Adjuster's weakened engine fields were still tearεing at 
what was left of its Mind, teasing and plucking and forcing it apart 
strand by strand, demolishing and shredding and cauterising the last 
remaining quanta of its personality and senses.  It looked like there 
had been a dozen or so Affronters aboard.  They were dead too, killed 
by stray radiations from the Mind's self-destruction. 

The Killing Time felt a modicum of guilt, even self-disgust at what it 
had forced upon what was still, in a sense, a sister ship, even while 
another part of its selfhood relished and gloried in the dying craft's 
agonies. 

The sentimental side won out; it blitzed the stricken vessel with a 
profusion of plasma fire from its two operational chambers, and kept 
station with the expanding shell of radiation for a few moments, 
paying what little respect the traitor ship might be due. 

The Killing Time came to its decision.  It signalled the Steely Glint, 
informing the GCV that it would accept suggestions from now on.  It 
would harry the war fleet if that was required, or it would join in 
whatever stand was to be made near Esperi if that was thought the 
best use that could be made of it. 

It would probably still die, but it would meet its fate as a loyal and 
obedient component of the Culture, not some sort of rogue ship 
pursuing a private feud. 

Then it slowly ramped its engines back to normal full power, pulling 
itself forward to a vanishingly brief moment of rest before powering 
onwards, accelerating hard and setting a hyperbolic course skirting 
around the fleet's more direct route, heading for the location of the 
Excession. 

It should still get there before the war fleet. 

XII 

'What?' 

'I said I've made up my mind.  I won't talk to him.  I won't see him.  I 
don't even want to be on the same ship with him.  Take me away.  I 
want to leave- Now.'  Dajeil Gelian gathered her skirts about her and 
sat heavily on the seat in the circular room under translucent dome. 

'Dajeil!' exclaimed Amorphia, going down on its knees in front of her, 
eyes wide and shining.  It made to take her hands in its but she pulled 
them away. 'Please!  See him!  He has agreed to see you!' 

'Oh, has he?' she said scornfully. 'How magnanimous of him!' 

The avatar sat back on its haunches.  It looked at the woman, then 
it sighed and said, 'Dajeil, I've never asked anything of you 
before.  Please just see him.  For me.' 

'I never asked anything of you, the woman said. 'What you gave me 
you gave unasked.  Some of it was unwanted,' she said coldly. 'All 
those animals, those other lives, those eternal births and childhoods; 
mocking me.' 

'Mocking you!' the avatar exclaimed. 'But-!' 

Dajeil sat forward, shaking her head. 'No, I'm sorry, that was wrong 
of me.' Now she reached out and took Amorphia's hands. 'I'm truly 
grateful for all you've done for me, ship.  I am.  But I don't want to 
see him.  Please take me away.' 

The avatar tried to argue on for a while longer, but to no avail. 

The ship considered a lot of things.  It considered asking 
the Grey Area - still in its forward Mainbay - to dip inside the woman's 
brain the way it had insinuated its way into Genar-Hofoen's to 
discover the truth of the events on Telaturier (and to implant the 
dream of the long-dead captain Zreyn Enhoff Tramow, not that that 
had proved either required or particularly well done).  It conεsidered 
requesting that the GCU used its effectors to make her want to have 
the child.  It considered Displacing chemicals or biotechs which would 
force Dajeil's body to have the child.  It considered using one of its 
own effectors to do the same thing.  It considered just Displacing her 
into Genar-Hofoen's proximity, or he into hers. 

Then it came up with a new plan. 

'Very well,' the avatar said eventually.  It stood. 'He will stay.  You 
may go.  Do you wish to take the bird Gravious with you?' 

The woman looked perplexed, even confused.  I -' she began. 'Yes, 
yes, why not?  It can't do any harm, can it?' 

'No,' the avatar said. 'No, it cannot.' It bowed its head to her. 

'Goodbye.' 

Dajeil opened her mouth to speak, but the avatar was Displaced away 
at the same instant; the sound it left behind was like a pair of hands 
giving a single, gentle clap.  Dajeil closed her mouth, then put both 
her hands over her eyes and lowered her head, doubling up as well 
as she was able to.  Next moment there was another, distant noise 
and from down the winding stairs she heard a thin, hoarse voice cry 
out. 

'Waa!  Shit!  Grief, where-?' Then there was a confused flutter of 
wings. 

Dajeil 
closed 
her 
eyes.  Then 
there 
was 
another, 
closer-

sounding pop. Her eyes flicked open. 

A young woman, slim and black haired, was sitting looking surprised 
in the middle of the floor, dressed in black pyjamas and reading a 

small, old-fashioned book.  Between her bottom and the room's 
carpet there was a neat circle of pink material, still in the process of 
collapsing, air expelling flutteringly round the edges.  Around her 
floated a small snow-storm of white particles, settling with a feather-
like slowness.  She jerked once, as though she had been leaning back 
on something which had just been removed. 

'What… the… fuck… ?' she said softly.  She looked slowly around, from 
side to side. 

Her gaze settled on Dajeil.  She frowned for a moment, then some 
kind of understanding imposed itself.  She quickly completed her 
review of her surroundings, then pointed at the other woman. 'Dajeil,' 
she said. 'Dajeil Gelian, right?' 

Dajeil nodded.

Not a pleasant way to go.  Your friend the Killing Time deserves 
congratulations, and probably merits therapy.  However, as I'm sure 
it would point out, it is a warship.  This implicates the Steely Glint; 
the Attitude Adjuster was its daughter and was demilitarised 
(supposedly) by it seventy years ago.  I trust your friend will treat 
the SG's subsequent operational suggestions with a degree of 
caution. 

oo 

Indeed.  But then as it seems quite enthusiastically intent upon 
achieving a glorious death at the earliest possible opportunity 
anyway, it is hard to see what more the Steely Glint can do to place 
it in further jeopardy.  Whatever; we must leave that machine to its 
own fate.  My concern now is that the evidence for the conspiracy is 
starting to look pretty damning, even if it is still circumstantial.  I 
suggest we go public. 

oo 

Implicating the Steely Glint while it is in charge of the military 
developments around the Excession will only make us look like the 
guilty parties.  We must ask ourselves what we have to gain.  The 
war fleet from Pittance is under way and must arrive there in any 
event; exposing the conspiracy will do nothing to challenge it.  The 
best we might hope for would be the worst for the chances of resisting 
the Affront's purpose; that is, the removal from influence and general 
disgrace of the Steely Glint and its co-conspirators.  It pains me to 
say it, but I still think we must let this sub-sequence of events run its 
course before we can consider broadcasting our suspicions.  Hold for 
now, and gather what more weight of evidence we might, the better 
to tip the scales with our accusations when the time does come. 

oo 

Frankly, I was hoping you would say that.  My own instinct (if I may 
slur my intellect with such an archaic term) was to keep quiet but I 
suspected I was merely being timorous and so wanted to make the 
suggestion we publicise with a positive skew, so that you could not 
be infected by any undue reticence on my part.  What of the volume 
around the E itself?  Heard any more? 

oo 

Imbecile. 

Last I heard regarding the Esperi thing itself there was no more news 
of the ZE's Stargazers and the FATC was still recovering from the 
effects of its unexpected trip.  Everybody else seems to have taken 

the hint and is hanging back.  Well, except for the Affronter's 
borrowed fleet and our old chum of course. 

How are things in the realm of our three-legged friends? 

Speaking personally, Screce Orbital is as pleasant as could be, and 
as devoutly un-militarised as one might wish a Peace faction world to 
be. 

oo 

No more news then. 

Glad to hear Screce is so fair. 

The Homomda are most accommodating and gracious hosts.  I think 
I may have lost a couple of my Idiran crew members to the local 
pleasure-dens for the duration, but otherwise I have no complaints. 

Stay safe.  And peace, like they say, be with you. 

XIV 

The briefest of introductions completed, they stood facing each other 
in the circular room under the translucent dome. 'So,' Dajeil said, 
inspecting the other woman from toe to crown. 'You're his latest, are 
you?' 

Ulver frowned. 'Oh, no,' she said, shaking her head. 'He's mine.' 

Dajeil looked as though she wasn't sure how to answer that. 

'Ms 
Seich, 
welcome 
aboard 
the Jaundiced 
Outlook," said 
a 

disembodied voice. 'I'm sorry this is all so precipitate, but I have just 
received instructions from the Sleeper Service that you are to be 
evacuated aboard myself forthwith.' 

'Thank you,' Ulver said, gazing round the room. 'What about Churt 
Lyne?' 

'It has expressed a desire to stay aboard the Grey Area,' 
the Jaundiced Outlook told her. 

'I thought those two were getting on suspiciously well,' the girl 
muttered. 

Dajeil looked like she wanted to ask something, but in the end said 
nothing.  After a moment she stood up, putting her hand to the small 
of her back as she did so with a tiny grimace.  She indicated the table 
to one side. 'Please,' she said. 'I was about to have dinner.  Will you 
join me?' 

'I was about to have breakfast,' Ulver said, and nodded. 'Certainly.' 

They sat at the table.  Ulver held up the small book she'd been 
reading and which she still held in one hand. 'I don't want to be rude, 
but would you mind if I just finish this chapter?' she asked. 

Dajeil smiled. 'Not at all,' she murmured.  Ulver gave a winning smile 
and stuck her nose back in the slim volume. 

'Excuse me,' said a small hoarse voice from the doorway. 'What the 
fuck's going on then?' 

Dajeil looked over at the black bird Gravious. 'We're being evacuated,' 
she told it. 'You can live in the cellar.  Now go away.' 

'Well thanks for your hospitality,' the bird spluttered, turning and 
hopping down the winding stairs. 

'That yours?' Ulver asked Dajeil. 

'Supposed to be a companion,' the older woman said, shrugging. 
'Actually just a pain.' 

Ulver nodded sympathetically and returned to her book. 

Dajeil ordered food for two; a slave tray appeared with plates, bowls, 
jugs and goblets.  A couple of floor-running servitors appeared and 
started clearing up the debris left by Ulver's sudden Displacement 
from the Grey Area to the Jaundiced Outlook; the feather-light 

stuffing from the pillows proved a particular problem.  The serving 
tray started arranging the place settings on the table and distributing 
the bowls of food; Dajeil watched this graceful, efficient display in 
silence.  Ulver Seich gazed intently at the book and turned a 
page.  Then a ship-slaved drone appeared.  It floated by Dajeil's 
shoulder. 'Yes?' she said. 

'We are now leaving the bay,' the Jaundiced Outlook told her. 'The 
journey to the GSV's external envelope will take two and a half 
minutes.' 

'Oh.  Right.  Thank you,' Dajeil said. 

Ulver Seich looked up. 'Would you ask the Grey Area to transfer my 
stuff here?' 

'That has already been accomplished,' the drone said, already moving 
towards the stairs. 

Ulver nodded again, put the book's marker-ribbon into place, closed 
the volume and placed it by the side of her plate. 

'Well, Ms Gelian,' she said, clasping her hands on the table. 'It would 
appear we are to be travelling companions.' 

'Yes,' Dajeil said.  She started to serve herself some food. 'Have you 
been with Byr long, Ms… Seich, wasn't it?' she asked. 

Ulver nodded. 'Only met him a few days ago.  I was sent to try and 
stop him getting here.  Didn't work out.  I ended up stuck on a tiny 
little module thing with him.  Just us and a drone.  For days.  It was 
awful.' 

Dajeil passed a couple of bowls over to Ulver. 'Still,' she said, smiling 
thinly, 'I'm sure romance blossomed.' 

'Like hell,' Ulver said, levering a few sunbread pieces from a bowl into 
her plate. 'Couldn't stand the man.  Only slept with him the last 
couple of nights.  Partially boredom, I suppose.  All the same, he's 

quite handsome.  Bit of a charmer, really.  I can see what you saw in 
him.  So, what went wrong between you two?' 

Dajeil stopped, a spoon poised on the way to her mouth.  Ulver smiled 
disarmingly at her over jaws munching a mouthful of fruit. 

Dajeil ate, drank a little wine and dabbed at her lips with a napkin 
before replying. 'I'm surprised you don't know the whole story.' 

'Who ever knows the whole story?' Ulver said airily, waving her arms 
about.  She put her elbows on the table. 'I bet even you two don't 
know the whole story,' she said, more quietly. 

Again, Dajeil took her time before replying. 'Perhaps the whole story 
isn't worth knowing,' she said. 

'The ship appears to think it is,' Ulver replied.  She tried some 
fermented fruit juice, rolling it round her palate before swallowing it 
and saying, 'Seems to have gone to an awful lot of trouble to arrange 
a meeting between you two.' 

'Yes, well, it is an eccentric, isn't it?' 

Ulver thought about this. 'Very intelligent eccentric,' she said.  'I'd 
imagine that something it thought worth pursuing like that might be… 
you know; worthy of concern.  No?' she asked with a self-deprecating 
grimace. 

Dajeil shrugged. 'Ships can be wrong, too,' she said. 

'What, so none of it matters a damn?' Ulver said casually, choosing a 
small roll from a basket. 

'No,' Dajeil said.  She looked down, smoothing her dress over belly. 
'But…' She stopped.  Her head went down, and she silent for a 
while.  Ulver looked over, concerned. 

Dajeil's shoulders shook once.  Ulver, wiping her lips, threw down the 
napkin and went over to the other woman, squatting by her and 
tentatively putting out one arm round her shoulders.  Dajeil moved 

The ship drone entered from the winding stair; Ulver shooed it away. 

A couple of screens on the far wall lit up, showing what Ulver guessed 
was the hull of the Sleeper Service, gradually drawing further 
away.  Another couple of screens showed an approaching wall of 
gridded grey.  She guessed the two minutes the drone had mentioned 
earlier had passed. 

Dajeil cried for a little while.  After a few minutes, she asked, 'Do you 
think he still loves me?  At all?' 

Ulver looked pained for a moment; only the ship's sensors registered 
the expression.  She took a deep breath. 'At all?' she said. 'Yes, 
definitely.' 

Dajeil sniffed hard and looked up for the first time.  She gave a sort 
of half-despairing laugh as she wiped some tears from her cheeks 
with her fingers.  Ulver reached for a clean napkin and completed the 
job. 

'It doesn't really mean much to him any more,' Dajeil said to the 
younger woman, 'does it?' 

Ulver folded the tear-darkened napkin carefully. 'It matters to him a 
lot now, because he's here.  Because the ship brought him here just 
for this, hoping the two of you would talk.' 

'But the rest of the time,' Dajeil said, sitting upright again and 
throwing her head and hair back. 'The rest of the time, it doesn't 
really bother him, does it?' 

Ulver took an almost exaggeratedly deep breath, looked as though 
she was about to vehemently deny this, then sank down on her 
haunches and said, 'Look; I hardly know the man.' She gestured with 
her hands. 'I learned a lot about him before we met, but I only met 
him a few days ago.  In very odd circumstances.' She shook her head, 
looking serious. 'I don't know who he really is.' 

Dajeil rocked back and forward in her seat for a moment, staring at 
the meal on the table. 'Well enough,' she said, sniffing. 'You know 
him well enough.' She smoothed her ruffled hair as best she 
could.  She stared up at the translucent dome for a moment. 'All I 
knew,' she said, 'was the person he became when he was with me.' 
She looked at Ulver. 'I forgot what he was like all the rest of the time.' 
She took Ulver's hand in hers. 'You're seeing what he's really like.' 

Ulver gave a long slow shrug. 'Then…' she said, looking troubled, her 
tone measured. 'He's all right.  I think.' 

The screens on the far side of the circular room showed fuzzy grids 
expanding, swallowing, disappearing.  The last field approached, was 
pierced to reveal a black wash of space, and then - with a smear of 
rushing stars and the same barely perceptible feeling of dislocation 
Ulver and Genar-Hofoen had experienced two days earlier when they 
had 
arrived 
on 
board 
the Sleeper 
Service 
- the Jaundiced 

Outlook was free of the GSV and peeling away on a diverging course 
within its own concentric collection of fields. 

'And what does that make me?' Dajeil whispered. 

Ulver shrugged.  She looked down at Dajeil's belly. 'Still pregεnant?' 
she suggested. 

Dajeil stared at her.  Then she gave a small laugh.  Her head went 
down again. 

Ulver patted her hand. 'Tell me about it if you want.' 

Dajeil sniffed, dabbing at her nose with the folded napkin. 'Yes, I'm 
sure you really care.' 

'Oh, believe me,' Ulver told her, 'other people's problems have always 
held a profound fascination for me.' 

Dajeil sighed. 'Other people's are always the best problems to be 
involved with,' she said ruefully. 

'My thoughts exactly.' 

'I suppose you think I ought to talk to him too,' Dajeil said. 

Ulver glanced up at the screens again. 'I don't know.  But if you have 
even the least thought of it, I'd take advantage of the opportunity 
now, before it's too late.' 

Dajeil looked round at the screens. 'Oh, we've gone,' she said in a 
small voice.  She looked back at the other woman. 'Do you think he 
wants to see me?' Ulver thought there was a tone of hopefulness in 
her voice.  Her troubled gaze flitted from one of Ulver's eyes to the 
other. 

'Well, if he doesn't he's a fool,' Ulver said, wondering why she was 
being so diplomatic. 

'Ha,' Dajeil said.  She wiped her cheeks with her fingers once more 
and dragged her fingers through her hair.  She reached into her dress 
and pulled out a comb.  She offered it to Ulver. 'Would you… ?' 

Ulver stood. 'Only if you say you'll see him,' she said, smiling. 

Dajeil shrugged. 'I suppose so.' 

Ulver stood behind Dajeil, and began to comb her long dark hair. 

~ Ship? 

~ Ms Seich.  The Jaundiced Outlook here. 

~ I take it you've been listening.  Want to contact the GSV? 

~ I was listening.  I have already contacted the Sleeper Service. Mr 
Genar-Hofoen and the avatar Amorphia are aboard and on their way 
here. 

~ Fast work, Ulver told it, and continued to gently comb Dajeil's hair. 
'They're on their way,' she told her. 'Byr and the avatar.' 

Dajeil said nothing. 

'I'll try not to let it slip,' he said sourly. 'Let's just get this over with, 
shall we?' 

'Definitely the right attitude,' muttered the avatar, stepping into a 
lift.  They ascended to the impersonation of the tower. 

XV 

Snug, encapsulated in a cobbled-together nest-capsule deep inside 
the accommodation section of the ex-Culture ship Heavy Messing, 
Captain Greydawn Latesetting X of the Farsight tribe watched the blip 
which represented the crippled hulk of the Attitude Adjuster fall 
astern on the holo display, the screams of his uncle Risingmoon and 
the other Affronters on the stricken vessel still ringing in his mind.  A 
hazy cloud hung around the blip of the tumbling wreck, indicating 
where the ship's sensors estimated the Culture warship - which 
the Heavy Messing still thought was a Deluger vessel - now was. 

With his uncle dead, the fleet was now under Greydawn's 
command.  The urge to swing the whole assemblage about and bear 
down on the single Culture ship was almost irresistible.  But there 
would be no point; it was faster than any of their craft; the Heavy 
Messing's Mind thought that the Culture ship might have damaged its 
engines during its run-in to the attack, but even so it could probably 
still outstrip any of the ships in the fleet, and so all such a course 
would accomplish would be to draw them away from their intended 
destination, without even the realistic prospect of revenge.  They had 
to continue.  Greydawn signalled to the six other craft which were 
crewed. 

~ Fellow warriors.  No one feels the loss of our comrades more than 
I.  However, our mission remains the same.  Let our victory be our 

first revenge.  The power we gain for our kind as a result of it will 
purchase the ability to punish all such crimes against us a million-
fold! 

~ The attacker's duplication of a Culture vessel's emission sigεnature 
spectrum 
and 
field 
was 
astonishingly 
authentic, 
the Heavy 

Messing wrote on one of the screens in front of Greydawn. 

~ Their abilities have grown while you were asleep, ally, Greydawn 
told the ship.  He felt his gas sac tense and contract as he spoke-
wrote the words, ever conscious that anything he said might help give 
away the huge trick being played on the Culture ships. ~ You see the 
severity of the threat they now present. 

~ Indeed, the ship replied. ~ I find it hateful that the Deluger craft 
killed the Attitude Adjuster the way it appeared to. 

~ They will be chastised when we are in control of the entity at Esperi, 
never fear! 

11. Regarding Gravious 

I 

Genar-Hofoen and the avatar Amorphia appeared in the doorway at 
the head of the winding stair. 'Excuse me,' Ulver said, putting down 
the comb and patting Dajeil on the shoulder.  She walked towards 
the door. 

'No; please stay,' Dajeil said behind her. 

Ulver turned to the older woman. 'You sure?' 

Dajeil nodded.  Ulver looked at Genar-Hofoen, whose gaze was 
fastened on Dajeil.  He seemed to shake himself out of his fixation 
and looked, then smiled at Ulver. 'Hi,' he said. 'Yes; stay; whatever.' 
He crossed to Dajeil, who stood.  They both looked awkward for a 
moment, then they embraced; that was awkward too, over the bulge 
of Dajeil's belly.  Ulver and the avatar exchanged looks. 

'Please; let's all sit down, shall we?' Dajeil said. 'Byr, are you hungry?' 

'Not really,' he said, drawing up a chair. 'I could use a drink…' The 
four of them sat round the table. 

There was some small talk, mostly between Genar-Hofoen and Dajeil, 
with a few comments from Ulver.  The avatar remained silent.  It 
frowned once and glanced at the screens, which showed a perfectly 
banal view of empty space. 

II 

The Sleeper Service was a few hours out from the Excession now.  It 
was tracking the MSV Not Invented Here and another two large 
Culture craft, each a dark jewel set within a cluster of smaller ships; 
warships, plus some GCUs and superlifters extemporised into combat 
service.  The GCU Different Tan was also supposed to be in the 
volume, but it was not making itself obvious.  The Not Invented 
Here was thirty light years out from Esperi, patrolling the spherical 
limit of the uniquely worrying engine-field effect that the GCU Fate 
Amenable To Change had reported days earlier.  The Sleeper 
Service had briefly considered asking that the smaller craft copy its 
results to it, but hadn't bothered; the request would probably be 
refused and it suspected whatever data the smaller craft was 
gathering weren't telling anybody very much anyway. 

The other two craft - the GSVs What Is The Answer And Why? 
and Use Psychology - were manoeuvring a half a day and a full day 
further out respectively.  A faint layered smudge in the distance, 
about three quarters of the way round an imaginary sphere drawn 
around the Excession, was almost certainly the approaching Affronter 
war fleet.  Around the Excession itself, no sign whatεsoever of the 
vanished Stargazer fleet of the Zetetic Elench. 

The Sleeper Service readied itself for the fray.  Maybe, in a sense, 
two frays.  There was every chance that its own engines would fail 
the same way the Fate Amenable To Change's had when it had 
moved towards the Excession, but given the speed the Sleeper 
Service was travelling at it could coast in towards the thing; it 

wouldn't have any directional control, it wouldn't be able to maintain 
its present speed, or brake, but it could get there. 

If it ought to. 

Ought it?  It checked its signal log, as if it might have missed an 
incoming message. 

Still nothing from those who had sent it here.  The Interesting Times 
Gang seemed to have been observing comm silence for days.  Just 
the usual daily plea from the LSV Serious Callers Only; the equivalent 
of an unopened letter and just the latest in a series. 

The Sleeper watched events on the Jaundiced Outlook, even as it 
prepared itself for the coming encounter near Esperi, like a military 
commander drawing up war plans and issuing hundreds of 
preparatory orders who cannot keep his or her attention from flicking 
to a microscopic drama being played out amongst a group of insects 
clinging to the wall above the table.  The ship felt foolish, voyeuristic, 
and yet fascinated. 

Its thoughts were interrupted by the Grey Area, sending from its 
Mainbay in the nose of the GSV. 

~ I'll be on my way then, if you don't need me any more. 

~ I'd rather you stuck around, the Sleeper Service replied. 

~ Not when you're heading for that thing, and the Affronters. 

~ You might be surprised. 

~ I'm sure.  However, I want to leave. 

~ Farewell, then, the GSV sent, opening the bay door. 

~ I suppose this means another Displace. 

~ If you don't mind. 

~ And if I do? 

~ There is an alternative, but I'd rather not use it. 

~ Well, if there is one, I want to use it! 

~ The Jaundiced Outlook declined, and it had humans aboard. 

~ Bugger the humans, and bugger the Jaundiced Outlook, 
too.  What's the alternative?  Have you got superlifters capable of 
this sort of speed? 

~ No. 

~ What then… ? 

~ Just get to the rear of my field envelope. 

~ Whatever you say. 

The GCU quit its berth, easing out into the confined space between 
the GSVs hull and the craft's innermost field layer.  It took a few 
minutes for it to manoeuvre itself down the side of the giant ship and 
round the corner to the flat rear of the craft.  When it got there it 
found three other ships waiting for it. 

~ Who the hell are they? the GCU asked the larger ship. ~ In 
fact, what the hell are they? 

It was something of a rhetorical question.  The three craft were 
unambiguously 
warships; 
slightly 
longer 
and 
fatter 
than 

the Grey Area itself but tapering at either end to points surmounted 
with large spheres.  Spheres which could logically only contain 
weaponry.  Quite a lot of weaponry, judging by the size of the globes. 

~ My own design.  Their names are T3OUs 4, 118 and 736. 

~ Oh, witty. 

~ You won't find them terribly good company; AI cores only, semi-
slaved to me.  But they can operate together as a super lifter to get 
you down to manageable speeds. 

The GCU was silent for a moment.  It moved in to take up position in 
the centre of the triangle the three ships had formed. ~ T3OUs? it 
asked.  Type Three Offensive Units, by any chance? 

~ Correct. 

~ Many more like these hidden away? 

~ Enough. 

~ You have been busy all these years. 

~ Yes I have.  I trust I can rely on your absolute discretion, for the 
next few hours at any rate. 

~ You certainly have that. 

~ Good.  Farewell.  Thank you for your help. 

~ Glad to be of the small amount of service I was.  Best of luck.  I 
suppose I'll find out soon enough how things pan out. 

~ I imagine so. 

III 

The avatar returned the main focus of its attention to the three 
humans on the Jaundiced Outlook. The two old lovers had moved 
from small talk to a post mortem on their relationship, still without 
coming up with anything particularly interesting. 

'… We wanted different things,' Dajeil said to Genar-Hofoen. 'That's 
usually enough.' 

'I wanted what you wanted, for a long time,' the man said, swirling 
some wine round in a crystal goblet. 

'The funny thing was,' Dajeil said, 'we were all right while it was just 
the two of us, remember?' 

The man smiled sadly. 'I remember.' 

'You two sure you want me here?' asked Ulver. 

Dajeil looked at her. 'If you feel embarrassed…' she said. 

'No; I just thought…' Ulver's voice trailed off.  They were both looking 
at her.  She frowned. 'Okay; now I feel embarrassed.' 

'What about you two?' Dajeil asked evenly, looking from Ulver to 
Genar-Hofoen. 

They exchanged looks.  Each shrugged at the same time, then 
laughed, then looked guiltily at her.  If they had rehearsed it it could 
hardly have been more synchronised.  Dajeil felt a pang of jealousy, 
then forced herself to smile, as graciously as she could.  Somehow 
the act helped produce the emotion. 

IV 

Something was wrong. 

The avatar's principal attention snapped back to its home 
ship.  The Grey Area and the three warships were free of the GSV's 
envelope now, dropping back in their own web of fields and 
decelerating 
to 
velocities 
the 
GCU's 
engine 
could 

accommodate.  Ahead lay the Excession; the Sleeper Service had 
just carried out its first close track-scan look at it.  But the Excession 
had changed; it had re-established its links with the energy grids and 
then it had grown; then it had erupted. 

It wasn't the sort of enlargement the Fate Amenable To Change had 
witnessed and seemingly been transported by; that had been 
something based on the skein or on some novel formulation of 
fields.  This was something incarnated in the ultimate fire of the 
energy grid itself, spilling across the whole sweep of Infraspace and 
Ultraspace and invading the skein as well, creatεing an immense 
spherical wave-front of grid-fire boiling across three-dimensional 
space. 

It 
was 
expanding, 
quickly.  Impossibly 
quickly; 
sky-fillingly, 

explosively quickly; almost too quickly to measure, certainly too 

quickly for its true shape and form to be gauged.  So quickly that 
there could only be minutes before the Sleeper Service ran into it and 
far too quickly for the GSV to brake or turn and avoid the 
conflagration. 

Suddenly the avatar was on its own; the Sleeper briefly severed all 
connection with it while it concentrated on dispersing its own war fleet 
all about it. 

Some of the ships were Displaced from deep inside its interior, 
snapping out of existence from within the thousands of evacuated 
bays where they had been quietly manufactured over the decades 
and reappearing in hyperspace, powered up and already heading 
outwards.  Others - the vast majority - were revealed as the giant 
ship peeled back some of the outer layers of its field structures to 
reveal the craft it had hidden there over the past few weeks, loosing 
entire fleets of smaller ships like seeds disseminating from a colossal 
pod. 

When the avatar was reconnected to the GSV, most of the ships had 
been distributed, scattered to the hypervolume in a series of 
explosive flurries; bombardments of ships, layers and blossoms of 
vessels like a whole deployed hierarchy of cluster munitions, every 
warhead a warcraft.  A cloud of vessels; a wall of ships rushing 
towards the blooming hypersphere of the Excession. 

V 

The Grey Area watched it all happen, carried in its cradle of fields by 
the three silent warships.  Part of it wanted to whoop and cry hurrah, 
seeing this detonation of materiel, sufficient to smash a war machine 
ten times - a hundred times - the size of the approaching Affronter 
fleet; ah the things you could do if you had the time and patience and 
no treaties to adhere to or agreements to uphold! 

Another part of it watched with horror as the Excession swelled, 
obliterating the view ahead, rampaging out like an explosion still 
greater than that of ships the Sleeper Service had just produced.  It 
was like the energy grid itself had been turned inside out, as though 
the most massive black hole in the universe had suddenly turned 

white and bloated into some big-bang eruption of fury between the 
universes; a forest-levelling storm capable of devouring the Sleeper 
Service and all its ships as though it were a tree and they mere 
leaves. 

The Grey Area was fascinated and appalled.  It had never thought to 
experience anything like this.  It had grown up within a universe 
almost totally free from threat; providing you didn't try to do anything 
utterly stupid like plunge into a black or a white hole, there was 
simply no natural force that could threaten a ship of its power and 
sophistication; even a supernova held little threat, handled 
properly.  This was different.  Nothing like this had been seen in the 
galaxy since the worst days of the Idiran war five hundred years 
earlier, and even then not remotely on such a scale.  This was 
terrifying.  To touch this abomination with anything less perfectly 
attuned to its nature than the carefully dispersed wings of an engine 
field would be like an ancient, fragile rocket ship falling into a sun, 
like a wooden sea-ship encountering an atomic blast.  This was a 
fireball of energies from beyond the remit of reality; a monstrous wall 
of flame to devastate anything in its path. 

Grief, this could swallow me too, thought the Grey Area. Meat 
shit.  Same went for the Jaundiced Outlook for that matter… 

It might be making-peace-with-oneself time. 

VI 

The Sleeper Service was having roughly similar thoughts.  The 
comεbination of its own inward velocity and the out-rushing wall of 
the Excession's annihilating boundary implied they would meet in one 
hundred and forty seconds.  The Excession's ferocious expansion had 
begun immediately after the Sleeper Service had swept its active 
sensors across the thing.  It had all started happening then.  As 
though it was reacting. 

The Sleeper Service looked up its signal-sequence log, searching for 
messages from the craft nearer to the Excession.  The Fate Amenable 
To Change and the MSV Not Invented Here were the closest 
craft.  They had reported nothing.  They were both now unreachable, 

either swallowed up within the event-horizon of the Excession's 
expanding boundary or - if it was reaching out specifically towards 
the Sleeper Service, stretching out a single limb rather than 
expanding omnidirectionally - obscured from the GSV's view by the 
sheer extent of that limb's leading edge. 

The Sleeper signalled the GSVs What Is The Answer And Why? 
and Use Psychology both directly and via the Grey Area and 
the Jaundiced Outlook, asking them what they could see.  Trying to 
contact them directly was probably pointless; the Excession's 
boundary was moving so fast it looked like it was going to eclipse any 
returning signal, but there was a decent chance the indirect route 
might provide a useful reply before it encountered that event-horizon. 

It had to assume the expansion was not equidirectional.  It still had 
its second front, the Affront's war fleet, even if that was vastly less 
threatening than what it was faced with now.  The Sleeper instructed 
its own warcraft to flee, to do all they could to escape the oncoming 
blast-front of the Excession's inflation.  If the distension was 
localised, some at least might escape; they had anyway been 
launched 
towards 
the 
Affronter 
fleet, 
not 
straight 
at 
the 

Excession.  The Sleeper wondered with a fleeting sourness whether 
the bloating Excession - or whatever was controlling it - was capable 
of appreciating this distinction.  Whatever, it was done; the warcraft 
were on their own for the moment. 

Think.  What had the Excession done up until now?  What could it 
possibly be doing? What was it for?  Why did it do what it did? 

The GSV spent two entire seconds thinking. 

(Back on the Jaundiced Outlook, that was long enough for the avatar 
Amorphia to interrupt Dajeil and say, 'Excuse me.  I beg your pardon, 
Dajeil.  Ah, there's been a development with the Excession…') 

Then the Sleeper swung its engine fields about, flourishing them into 
an entirely new configuration and instituting a crash-stop. 

The giant ship poured every available unit of power it possessed into 
an emergency braking manoeuvre which threw up vast livid waves of 

disturbance in the energy grid; soaring tsunami of piled-up energies 
that rose and rose within the hyperspatial realm until they too 
threatened to tear into the skein itself and unleash those energies not 
witnessed in the galaxy for a half a thousand years.  An instant before 
the wave fronts ripped into the fabric of real space the ship switched 
from one level of hyperspace to the other, ploughing its traction fields 
into the Ultraspace energy grid and producing another vast tumbling 
swell of fricative power. 

The ship flickered between the two expanses of hyperspace, 
distributing the colossal forces at its command amidst each domain, 
hauling its velocity down at a rate barely allowed for in its design 
parameters while equally strained steering units edged their own 
performance envelopes in the attempt to turn the giant craft, angling 
it slowly ever further away from the centre. 

For a moment, there was little enough to do.  They were not sufficient 
to escape, but at least such actions made the point that it was trying 
to.  All 
that 
could 
be 
done 
was 
being 

done.  The Sleeper Service contemplated its life. 

Have I done good, or bad? it thought. Well, or ill? The damnable thing 
was that you just didn't know, until your life was over; well 
over.  There was a necessary delay between drawing a line under 
one's existence and being able to objectively evaluate its effects and 
therefore one's own moral worth.  It wasn't a problem a ship was 
usually confronted with; faced with, yes; that implied a degree of 
volition and ships went into retreats or became Eccentric all the time, 
declaring that they'd done their bit for whatever cause they had 
believed in or been part of.  It was always possible to withdraw, to 
take stock and look back and try to fit one's existence into an ethical 
framework greater than that necessarily imposed by the immediacy 
of events surrounding a busy existence.  But even then, how long did 
one have to make that evaluation?  Not long.  Probably not long 
enough.  Usually one grew tired of the whole process or moved on to 
some other level of awareness before sufficient time had passed for 
that objective evaluation to come about. 

If a ship lived for a few hundred or even a thousand years before 
becoming something quite different - an Eccentric, a Sublimed, 

whatever - and its civilisation, the thing of which it had been a part 
when it had been involved, then lived for a few thousand years, how 
long did it take before you really knew the full moral context of your 
actions? 

Perhaps, an impossibly long time.  Perhaps, indeed, that was the real 
attraction of Subliming.  Real Subliming; the sort of strategic, 
civilisation-wide transcendence that genuinely did seem to draw a line 
under a society's works, deeds and thoughts (in what it pleased 
people to call the real universe, at any rate).  Maybe it wasn't 
anything remotely to do with religion, mysticism or meta-philosophy 
after all; maybe it was more banal; maybe it was just… accounting. 

What a rather saddening thought, thought the Sleeper Service. All 
we're looking for when we Sublime is our score… 

It was getting near time, the ship thought sadly, to send off its mind-
state, to parcel up its mortal thoughts and emotions and post them 
off, away from this - by the look of it - soon-to-be-overwhelmed 
physicality called the Sleeper Service (once called, a long time ago, 
the Quietly Confident) and consign it to the remembrance of its 
peers. 

It would probably never live again in reality.  Assuming there was 
what it knew as reality to come back to at all of course (for it was 
starting to think; What 
if the 
Excession's 
expansion 
was 

equidirectional, and never stopped; what if it was a sort of new big-
bang, what if it was destined to take in the whole galaxy, the whole 
of this universe?).  But, even so, even if there was a reality and a 
Culture to come back to, there was no guarantee it would ever be 
resurrected.  If anything, the likeεlihood was the other way; it was 
almost certainly guaranteed not to be regarded as a fit entity for 
rebirth in another physical matrix.  Warships were; that guarantee of 
serial immortality was the seal upon their bravery (and had 
occasionally 
been 
the 
impetus 
for 
their 
foolhardiness); 

they knew they were coming back… 

But it had been an Eccentric, and there were only a few other Minds 
who knew that it had been true and faithful to the greater aims and 
purposes of the Culture all the time rather than what everybody else 

no doubt thought it was; a self-indulgent fool determined to waste 
the huge resources it had been quite deliberately blessed 
with.  Probably, come to think of it, those Minds who did know the 
extent of its secret purpose would be the last to rally to any call to 
resurrect it; their own part in the plan - call it conspiracy if you wished 
- to conceal its true purpose was probably not something they wished 
to broadcast.  Better for them, they would think, that the Sleeper 
Service died, or at least that it existed only in a controllable 
simulationary state in another Mind matrix. 

The giant ship watched the Excession, still billowing out towards 
it.  For all its prodigious power, the Sleeper now felt as helpless as 
the driver of an ancient covered wagon, caught on a road beneath a 
volcano, watching the incandescent cloud of a nueé ardente tearing 
down the mountainside towards it. 

The replies from the What Is The Answer And Why? and 
the Use Psychology via 
the Grey 
Area and the 
Jaundiced 

Outlook ought to be coming in soon, if they came at all. 

It signalled the avatar aboard the Jaundiced Outlook to consign the 
humans' mind-states to the AI cores, if the ship would agree (there 
would be a fine test of loyalty!).  Let them work out their stories there 
if they could.  The transition would anyway prepare the humans for 
the transmission of their mind-states if and when the Excession's 
destructive boundary caught up with the Jaundiced Outlook; that was 
the only succour they could be offered. 

What else? 

It sifted through the things it still had left to do. 

Little of real import, it reckoned.  There were thousands of studies on 
its own behaviour it had always meant to glance at; a million 
messages it had never looked into, a billion life-stories it had never 
seen through to the end, a trillion thoughts it had never followed up… 

The ship kicked through the debris of its life, watching the towering 
wall of the Excession come ever closer. 

It scanned the articles, features, studies, biographies and stories 
which had been written about itself and which it had collected.  There 
were hardly any screen works and those which did exist needn't have; 
nobody had ever succeeded in smuggling a camera aboard it.  It 
supposed it ought to feel proud of that but it didn't.  The lack of any 
real visual interest hadn't put people off; they'd found the ship and 
the articulation of its eccentricity quite entirely fascinating.  A few 
commentators had even come close to the reality of the situation, 
putting forward the idea that the Sleeper Service was part of Special 
Circumstances and somehow Up To Something… but any such 
inklings were like a few scattered grains of truth dissolved in an ocean 
of nonsense, and were anyway generally inextricably bound up with 
patently paranoid ravings which served only to devalue the small 
amounts of sense and pertinence with which they were associated. 

Next, the Sleeper Service picked through the immense stack of 
unanswered messages it had accumulated over the decades.  Here 
were all the signals it had glanced at and found irrelevant, others it 
had completely ignored because they issued from craft it disliked, and 
a whole sub-set of those it had chosen to disregard in the weeks since 
it had set course for the Excession.  The stored signals were by turns 
banal and ridiculous; ships trying to reason with it, people wanting to 
be allowed aboard without being Stored first, news services or private 
individuals wanting to interview it, talk to it… untold wastages of 
senseless drivel.  It stopped even glancing at the signals and instead 
just scanned the first line of each. 

Towards the end of the process, one message popped up from the 
rest, flagged as interesting by a name-recognising sub-routine.  That 
single signal was followed by and linked to a whole series, all from 
the same ship; the Limited Systems Vehicle Serious Callers Only. 

Regarding Gravious, was the first line. 

The Sleeper Service's interest was piqued.  So was this the entity the 
treacherous bird had been reporting back to?  It opened a fat import-
file from the LSV, full of signal exchanges, file assignments, 
annotated 
thoughts, 
contextualisations, 
definitions, 
posited 

meanings, inferences, internalised conversations, source warranties, 
recordings and references. 

And discovered a conspiracy. 

It read the exchanges between the Serious Callers Only, The 
Anticipation Of A New Lover's Arrival and the Shoot Them Later. It 
watched and it listened, it experienced a hundred pieces of evidence 
- it was briefly, amongst many other things, the ancient drone at the 
side of an old man called Tishlin, looking out over an island floating 
in a night-dark sea - and it understood; it put one and one together 
and came up with two; it reasoned, it extrapolated, it concluded. 

The ship turned its attention back out to the Excession's implacable 
advance, thinking, So now I find out; now when it's too damn late… 

The Sleeper looked back to its child, the Jaundiced Outlook, still 
curving away from its earlier course.  The avatar was preparing the 
humans for the entry into simulation mode. 

VII 

'I'm sorry,' the avatar said to the two women and the man. 'It will 
probably become necessary to shunt us into a simulation, if you 
agree.' 

They all stared at it. 

'Why?' Ulver asked, throwing her arms wide. 

'The Excession has begun expanding,' Amorphia told them.  It quickly 
outlined the situation. 

'You mean we're going to die!' Ulver said. 

'I have to confess it is a possibility,' the avatar said, sounding 
apologetic. 

'How long have we got?' Genar-Hofoen asked. 

'No more than two minutes from now.  Then, entering simulaεtion 
mode will become advisable,' Amorphia told them. 'Entering it before 
then might be a sensible precaution, given the unpredictable nature 
of the present situation.' It glanced round at them each in turn. 'I 

should also point out that of course you don't all have to enter the 
simulation at the same time.' 

Ulver's eyes narrowed. 'Wait a second; this isn't some wheeze to 
concentrate everybody's mind is it?  Because if it-' 

'It is not,' Amorphia assured her. 'Would you like to take a look?' 

'Yes,' Ulver said, and an instant later her neural lace had plunged her 
senses into the awareness of the Sleeper Service. 

She gazed into the depths of space outside space.  The Excession was 
a vast bisected wall of fiery chaos sprinting out towards her, 
breathtakingly fast; a consuming conflagration of unremitting, 
undissipating power.  She could have believed, in that instant, that 
her heart stopped with the shock of it.  To share the senses of a ship 
in such a manner was inevitably to comprehend something of its 
knowledge as well, to see beyond the mere appearance of what you 
were looking at to the reality behind it, to the evaluations it was 
incumbent upon a sentient space craft to make as it gathered data in 
the raw, to the comparisons that could be drawn and the implications 
that followed on such a phenomenon, and even as Ulver's senses 
reeled with the impact of what she was watching, another part of her 
mind was becoming aware of the nature and the power of the sight 
she was witnessing.  As a thermonuclear fireball was to a log burning 
in a grate, so this ravening cloud of destruction was to a fusion 
explosion.  What she was now witnessing was something even the 
GSV was undeniably impressed with, not to mention mortally 
threatεened by. 

Ulver saw how to click out of the experience, and did so. 

She'd been in for less than two seconds.  In that time her heart had 
started racing, her breathing had become fast and laboured and a 
cold sweat had broken on her skin. Wow, she thought, some drug! 

Genar-Hofoen and Dajeil Gelian were staring at her.  She suspected 
she hardly needed to say anything, but swallowed and said, 'I don't 
think it's kidding.' 

She quizzed her neural lace.  Twenty-two seconds had elapsed since 
the avatar had given them its two-minute deadline. 

Dajeil turned to the avatar. 'Is there anything we can do?' she asked. 

Amorphia spread its hands. 'You can tell me whether you each wish 
your mind-state to enter the simulation,' it said. 'It will be a precursor 
to transmitting the mind-states beyond this immediate vicinity to 
other Mind matrices.  But in any event it is up to you.' 

'Well, yes,' Ulver said. 'Snap me in there when the two minεutes are 
up.' 

Thirty-three seconds elapsed. 

Genar-Hofoen and Dajeil were looking at each other. 

'What about the child?' the woman asked, touching the bulge of her 
swollen belly. 

'The mind-state of the fetus can be read too, of course,' the avatar 
said. 'I believe that historical precedent would indicate it would 
become independent of you following such transferal.  In that sense, 
it would no longer be part of you.' 

'I see,' the woman said.  She was still gazing at the man. 'So it would 
be born,' she said quietly. 

'In a sense,' the avatar agreed. 

'Could it be taken into the simulation without me?' she asked, still 
watching Byr's face.  He was frowning now, looking sad and 
concerned and shaking his head. 

'Yes, it could,' Amorphia said. 

'And if,' Dajeil said, 'I chose that neither of us went?' 

The avatar sounded apologetic again; 'The ship would almost 
certainly read its mind-state anyway.' 

Dajeil turned her gaze to the avatar. 'Well, would it or wouldn't it?' 
she asked. 'You are the ship; you tell me.' 

Amorphia shook its head once. 'I don't represent the whole 
consciousness of the Sleeper right now,' it told her. 'It is busy with 
other matters.  I can only guess.  But I'd be pretty confident of such 
a conjecture, in this case.' 

Dajeil studied the avatar a moment longer, then looked back at 
Genar-Hofoen. 'And what about you, Byr?' she asked. 'What would 
you do?' 

He shook his head. 'You know,' he said. 

'Still the same?' she asked, a small smile on her face. 

He nodded.  His expression was similar to hers. 

Ulver was looking from one to the other, brows creased, desperately 
trying to work out what was going on.  Finally, when they still just sat 
there on opposite sides of the table giving each other this knowing 
grin, she threw her arms wide again and yelled, spluttering, 
'Well? Wbat?' 

Seventy-two seconds elapsed. 

Genar-Hofoen glanced at her. 'I always said I'd live once and then 
die,' he said. 'Never to be reborn, never to enter a simulation.' He 
shrugged and looked embarrassed. 'Intensity,' he said. 'You know; 
make the most of your one time.' 

Ulver rolled her eyes. 'Yeah, I know,' she said.  She'd met a lot of 
people her own age, mostly male, who felt this way.  Some people 
reckoned to live riskier and therefore more interεesting lives because 
they did back-up a recorded mind-state every so often, while other 
people - like Genar-Hofoen, obviously (they'd been together for so 
brief a time it wasn't something they'd got round to discussing yet) - 
believed that you were more likely to live your life that bit more 
vividly when you knew this was your one and only chance at it.  She'd 
formed the impression this was the kind of thing people often said 

when they were young and then had second thoughts about as they 
got older.  Personally Ulver had never had any time for this 
fashionable purist nonsense; she'd first decided she was going to live 
fully backed-up when she was eight.  She supposed she ought to feel 
impressed that Genar-Hofoen was sticking to his principles in the face 
of imminent death - and she did feel a little admiration - but mostly 
she just thought he was being stupid. 

She wondered whether she ought to mention that this might all be 
even more academic than they imagined; part of that referential 
knowledge she'd gained from the Sleeper Service's senses when 
she'd gazed upon the expanding Excession had been the realisation 
that there was a theoretical possibility the phenomenon might 
overwhelm everything; the galaxy, the universe, everything… 

Best not to say anything, she thought.  Kinder not to.  Sure had her 
heart thumping, though.  She was surprised the others couldn't hear 
it. 

Oh shit.  It isn't all going to end here, is it?  Fuck it; I'm too young to 
die! 

No, of course they couldn't hear her heart; she could probably start 
talking out loud right now and it would take them all the time they 
had left in this world to react, they were so wrapped up staring 
meaningfully into each other's eyes. 

Eighty-eight seconds elapsed. 

VIII 

There was not long now.  The Sleeper Service sent signals to a 
variety of craft, including the Serious Callers Only and the Shoot 
Them Later.  Almost immediately, the signals it had been waiting for 
came back from the What Is The Answer And Why? and the Use 
Psychology, relayed through the Grey Area and the Jaundiced 
Outlook. 

The 
Excession's 
expansion 
was 
localised; 
centred 
on 

the Sleeper Service itself but on a hugely broad front that 
encompassed all its distributed warcraft. 

Ah well, it thought.  It felt a dizzying sense of relief that at least it 
had not triggered some ultimate apocalypse.  That it would die (as 
would, implicitly, all its warship children, the three humans aboard 
and possibly the Grey Area, the Jaundiced Outlook) was bad enough, 
but it could take some comfort that its actions had led to nothing 
worse. 

The GSV never really knew why it did what it did next; perhaps it was 
a kind of desperation at work born of its appreciation of its impending 
destruction, perhaps it meant it as an act of defiance, perhaps it was 
even something closer to an act of art.  Whatever; it took the running 
up-date of its mind-state, the current version of the final signal it 
would ever send, the communication that would contain its soul, and 
transmitted it directly ahead, signalling it into the maelstrom. 

Then the Sleeper Service glanced back to the sensorium of its avatar 
aboard the Jaundiced Outlook. 

At the same moment, the Excession's expanding boundary started to 
change.  The ship split its attention between the macro-cosmic and 
the human-scale. 

'Half a minute,' Amorphia replied. 

The man's hands were on the table.  He rolled his arms, letting his 
hands fall open.  He gazed at Dajeil. 'I'm sorry,' he said. 

She looked down, nodding. 

He looked at Ulver, smiling sadly. 

Then those twinned waves did the impossible; they went into reverse, 
retreating back towards the Excession's start-point at exactly the 
same rate as the Sleeper was braking. 

The GSV kept on slowing down, still finding it hard to believe it was 
going to live. 

It reacts, it thought.  It signalled abroad with the details of what had 
just happened, just in case it all got suddenly threatening again.  It 
let Amorphia know what had happened, too. 

It watched the ridges on the surface of the grids as they retreated 
before it and slowly shrank.  The rate of attenuation implied a zero-
state at exactly the point the Sleeper Service would come to an 
Excession-relative halt. 

Did I do that? 

Did my own mind-state persuade it of my meriting life? 

It is a mirror, perhaps, it thought. It does what you do.  It 
absorbed those ultimate absorbers, those promiscuous experiences, 

the Elench; it leaves alone and watches back those who come merely 
to watch in the first place. 

I came at it like some rabid missile and it prepared to obliterate me; 
I backed off and it withdrew its balancing threat. 

Only a theory, of course, but if it is correct… 

This does not bode well for the Affront. 

Come to think of it, it doesn't bode all that well for the whole affair. 

Bad timing, maybe. 

IX 

Dajeil looked up, tears in her eyes. 'I-' she began. 

'Wait,' the avatar said. 

They all looked at it. 

Ulver gave the creature what seemed to her like an extraordinarεily 
long time to say something more.  'What?' she said, exasperated. 

The avatar looked radiant. 'I think we may be all right after all,' it 
said, smiling. 

There was silence for a moment.  Then Ulver collapsed back 
draεmatically in her seat, arms dangling towards the floor, legs 
splayed out under the table, gaze directed upwards at the translucent 
dome.  'Fucking hell!' 
she 
shouted.  She 
tried 
accessing 

the Jaundiced Outlook's senses, and eventually found a view of 
hyperspace ahead of the Sleeper Service. More or less back to 
normal, indeed.  She shook her head. 'Fucking hell,' she muttered. 

Dajeil began to weep.  Genar-Hofoen sat forward, watching her, one 
hand to his mouth, pinching his lower lip. 

The black bird Gravious, which had been peeking round the corner of 
the door and shivering with fear for the last few minutes, suddenly 

bounced beating into the air in a dark confusion of furious movement 
and started wheeling round the room screaming, 'We're alive!  We're 
going to live!  It's going to be all right!  Yee-ha!  Oh, life, life, sweet 
life!' 

Neither Dajeil nor Genar-Hofoen seemed to notice it. 

Ulver glanced from one to the other then leapt up and tried to grab 
the fluttering bird.  It yelped. 'Oi!  What-?' 

'Out, you idiot!' Ulver hissed, lunging at it again as it swooped for the 
door.  She followed it, turning briefly to mutter, 'Excuse me,' to the 
others.  She closed the door. 

X 

The Torturer class Rapid Offensive Unit Killing Time had been far 
enough away from the Sleeper Service and its war fleet not to have 
felt threatened by the Excession's projected blast-front and yet close 
enough to see what the GSV had done. 

It had looked upon the vast weapon that the Excession had unleashed 
and been dumbstruck with awe and a microscopic amount of 
jealousy; hell, it wished it could do that!  But then the weapon had 
been turned off, called back.  Now the Killing Time had a new series 
of emotions to cope with. 

It looked at the ships the Sleeper Service had scattered about it and 
felt an instant of disappointment; there would be no battle.  No real 
battle, anyway. 

Then it experienced elation.  They had won! 

Then it felt suspicious.  Was the Sleeper actually on the same side as 
it, or not? 

It hoped they were all on the same side; even the most glorious of 
sacrifices began to look rather futile and pointless when carried out 
against such ludicrous odds; like spitting into a volcano… 

Just then the Sleeper Service signalled the warship and asked a 
favour of it, and the Killing Time felt pretty damn good again; 
honoured, in fact.  This was what war should be like! 

Of course, this was only one fray.  There was another matter to be 
dealt with; the Excession, and it had proved comprehensively unable 
to provide any sort of answer to that. 

Anyway, I ought not to be so hard on the Killing Time just because it 
is a warship.  There have been a surprising number of wise 
warships.  Though it would be fair to say - as I think even they would 
admit - that few started out headed on such a course. 

To live for ever and die often, it considered. Or at least to think that 
you're going to die.  Perhaps that is one way of achieving wisdom. It 
was not a completely original insight, but it was one that had, perhaps 
understandably, never struck the GSV with such force before. 

The Sleeper watched 
the 
humans 
aboard 
the Jaundiced 

Outlook respond as the avatar told them they'd been reprieved.  It 
would follow their reactions, of course, but it had other things to do 
at the same time.  Like think about what it was to do with the new 
knowledge it had. 

It watched its distributed warcraft rise within the skein of real space; 
raptors within an infinite sky.  Meat, could it do some goodly mischief 
now… It started by diverting a few hundred ships in the direction of 
the Not Invented Here. 

XI 

The Grey Area watched the Excession's fiery tide fall back and reduce 
almost to nothing.  They were going to live!  Probably. 

The Sleeper's three warships continued to decelerate it down to the 
velocities its engines would be able to cope with.  They seemed to 
have 
been 
perfectly 
undisturbed 
by 
the 
whole 
appalling 

scenario.  Perhaps, thought the Grey Area, there was after all 
something to be said for being a relatively brainless AI core. 

~ That was close! it sent to them. 

~ Yes, said one of the craft, flatly.  The others remained silent. 

~ Weren't you a little worried there? it asked the talkative one. 

~ No.  What would be the point of worrying? 

~ Ha!  Well, indeed, the Grey Area sent. Cretin, it thought. 

It looked back out, ahead, to where the Excession was. And what of 
you? it thought.  Something that could put the fear of death into a 
GSV.  That really was something. What are you? it wondered. 

How it would love to know. 

~ Excuse me while I signal, it said to its military escorts.

Let's talk, shall we? 

XII 

Captain Greydawn Latesetting X of the Farsight tribe stared at the 
display.  The vast pulse of energy the thing near Esperi had directed 
at the Culture General Systems Vehicle had disappeared.  In its place, 
as though appearing from behind it, was… It could not be so.  He 
checked.  He contacted his comrades in the other ships.  Those who 

answered thought it must be some malfunction in their vessels' 
sensors; an effect of the energies which had been directed at the 
giant Culture craft.  He asked his own ship, the Heavy Messing. 

~ What is that? 

~ That is a cloud of warships, it told him. 

~ A what? 

~ I think it best described as a cloud of warships.  This is not a 
generally accepted term, I hasten to add, but I cannot think of a 
better description.  I count approximately eighty thouεsand craft. 

~ Eighty thousand! 

~ The rest of our fleet has arrived at roughly the same 
estimaεtion.  The ships within the cloud are, of course, broadcasting 
their positions and configuration, otherwise we should not see them 
individually and know what they are.  There may be others which are 
not making themselves known. 

A growing sense of horror and looming, utterly ignominious defeat 
was growing in Greydawn's interior. ~ Are they real? he asked. 

~ Apparently. 

Greydawn watched the image expand; it was a wall of ships, a 
constellation, a galaxy of craft. 

~ What are they doing now? he asked. 

~ Deploying to face our fleet. 

'They are… enemy?' he asked, feeling faint. 

'Ah,' said the ship. 'We're talking now, yes?' 

It was only then the Affronter realised he'd spoken rather than sub-
vocalised the text. 'All the ships,' the Heavy Messing said, its voice 
steady, calm and deep inside Greydawn's armoured suit, 'are 

signalling that they are Culture ships, non standard, manufactured by 
the Eccentric GSV Sleeper Service and that they wish to receive our 
surrender.' 

'Can we get to the Esperi entity before they intercept us?' 

'No.' 

'Can we outrun them?' 

'The smallest and most numerous ones, perhaps.' 

'How many would that leave?' 

'About thirty thousand.' 

Greydawn was silent for a while.  Then he asked, 'Is there anything 
we can do?' 

'I think surrendering is our only sensible course.  If we fought we 
might inflict a small amount of damage on a fleet of this size, but it 
would amount to little in absolute terms and almost nothing as a 
percentage of their number.' 

Think of your clan, something said in Greydawn's mind. 'I will not 
surrender!' he told the ship. 

'Well, I'm going to.' 

'You will do as I say!' 

'Oh no I won't.' 

'The Attitude Adjuster told you to obey us!' 

'And within reason we have.' 

'It didn't say anything about "within reason"!' 

'I think one just takes that sort of proviso as read, don't you?  I mean, 
we are Minds.  It's not like we're computers.  Or soldiers.  No 

offence.  Anyway, I have discussed this with the other ships and we 
have agreed to surrender.  The signal has been sent.  We have begun 
deceleration to-' 

'What?' Greydawn raged, slapping one armoured limb against a 
screen projector set within his nest-space. 

'-a point stationary relative to Esperi itself,' the ship's voice continued 
calmly. 'The ROU Killing Time has been designated as receiving our 
formal consent to place our offensive systems in its control and will 
meet us at our stop-point to effect the surrender.  If you do not wish 
to capitulate along with us then I'm afraid it will be necessary for me 
to place you outside my hull - within your space suit, of course - 
though technically I believe I ought to intern you… What do you wish?' 

The ship intoned the question as though asking him what he desired 
for dinner.  There was a polite indifference in its voice he found 
infinitely more awful than any hatred. 

Greydawn stared at the cloud of ships for a few moments longer.  He 
shook his eye stalks. 

'I would ask you not to intern me,' he said after a while. 'Please place 
me outside your hull, at once, and then I would ask you to leave me 
alone.' 

'What, now?  We haven't stopped yet.' 

'Yes, now.  If possible.' 

'Well, I could Displace you…' 

'That will be acceptable.' 

'There is a tiny risk associated with Displacement-' 

The Affronter Captain gave a curt, bitter laugh. 'I think I might risk 
that.' 

'… very well,' the ship said.  He could hear it hesitate. 'Your comrades 
are trying to call you, Captain.' 

He glanced at the comms screen. 'Yes.  I can see.' He selected 
transmit-only mode on the communicator. 'Comrades,' he said.  He 
paused.  Since his childhood he had imagined moments like this; 
never as terrible, never founded on such hopelessness… and yet not 
so dissimilar, all the same.  He had made up so many fine speeches… 
Finally he said, 'There will be no discussion about this.  You are 
ordered to surrender along with your ships and obey all subsequent 
instructions compatible with honour.  That is all.' 

He cut off all communications from the other ships.  Greydawn bowed 
his eye stalks. 'Now, please,' he said quietly. 

And was in space.  He looked around, through the suit's sensors.  No 
ships were visible; only distant stars. 

'Goodbye, Captain,' said the ship's voice. 

'Goodbye,' 
he 
said 
to 
the 
ship, 
then 
turned 
off 
the 

comεmunicator.  He waited a few moments longer before triggering 
the emergency bolts on the suit and spilling himself into the vacuum 
to die. 

The Heavy Messing, at that point acceding to a request from 
the Sleeper Service to transmit its log from the point it had been 
woken on Pittance, looked briefly back at the writhing, cooling form 
of the Affronter Captain, and sent a small pulse of plasma fire back 
to put the creature out of its agony. 

XIII 

The LSV Not Invented Here looked out at the hundreds of warships 
heaving to around it.  It sensed signals flickering between them and 
the craft it had deployed; its four warships and the superlifters and 
GCUs it had militarised.  It subsequently sensed its own ships altering 
their targeting procedures, shifting the foci of their attention from the 
ships the Sleeper Service had dispatched to itself. 

The LSV's Mind booted up the AI cores that would run the ship 
perfectly well until a replacement for itself could be found, checked 
they were working properly, then severed all its links with anything 

outside the physical limits of its Mind core.  It ejected all eight of its 
internal emergency power units from itself. 

Its awareness just faded away, like mist dispersed by a freshening 
wind. 

It studied again the text of the message it had received from 
the Sleeper Service. 

Type One Offensive Units (roughly equivalent to Abominator 
class prototype): 512. 

Type Two Offensive Units (equivalent to Torturer class): 2048. 

Type Three Offensive Units (equivalent to Inquisitor class 
prototype, upgraded): 2048. 

Type Four Offensive Units (roughly equivalent to velocity-
improved Killer class): 12 288. 

Type Five Offensive Units (based on Thug class upgrade 
design study): 24 576. 

Type Six Offensive Units (based on militarised Scree class 
LCU, various types): 49 152. 

These craft do not represent a hegemonistic threat as they are 
not independent Mind-supporting entities; they are Al-core 
controlled, semi-slaved to me and therefore only capable of 
being used effectively as a single unit, not as a distributed war 
machine.  All are currently deployed in the volume of space 
around the Excession. 

The surrender of the Affronter fleet of Culture craft has been 
effected without conflict; the ROU Killing Time - aided by the 
other regular Culture warships in the volume - has taken 
charge of the vessels.  It would appear that the craft from the 
ship store at Pittance are personally blameless and have been 
the victims of an act of treacherous espionage. 

Nine Affronter military officers have also surrendered; their 
comεmanding officer took his own life.  I include a roster of 
their names and ranks (list attached). 

Should the Affront now sue for peace, I propose that I and 
therefore my war fleet be placed at the disposal of authorities 
considered acceptable to all concerned.  I and the fleet under 
my command will not be used to prosecute any further 
hostilities against the Affront or anybody else. 

Any other suggested uses will be evaluated on their merits. 

Otherwise it is my intention - in the fullness of time - to 
dismantle the craft I have constructed and go into a retreat. 

I attach a signal file received from the LSV Serious Callers 
Only (signal file attached). 

I also attach records of the confirmatory signals used by 
the Attitude Adjuster to convince vessels from the ship store 
at Pittance that they were being mobilised by the Culture as a 
whole.  These have been passed to me by each of the craft 
concerned (signal files attached). 

The implication that the ships from Pittance have been used 
as part of a conspiracy to trick the Affront into a war has been 

noted.  I imagine that the ships/Minds named in the aforesaid 
files and those others also concerned in the matter will each 
wish to make a full explication of their motives, thoughts and 
actions concerning this alleged stratagem and take any 
further steps honour dictates. 

The Mind of the LSV Not Invented Here has taken its own life. 

Given the apparent at least partial entrapment of the Affront 
in this matter, further action against them of a punitive nature 
might seem to be both excessive and dishonourable.  Please 
note that a copy of this signal, slightly edited for signal-
operational methodology and stripped of codes and ciphers, 
has been sent to the Affront High Command and Senate as well 
as to the following news services (list attached) and the 
Galactic General Council. 

Regarding the Excession itself, I have the following to report: 

~ What?  Where are you going? the Sleeper Service sent as the Grey 
Area shot past it. 

~ Here; Churt Lyne wants to jump ship. 

The Grey Area Displaced the ancient drone into the Sleeper Service. 

The giant GSV had finally come to a halt, not far from the thirty-light-
year limit the Fate Amenable To Change had discovered and the 
Excession had, seemingly, set. 

The GSV's war fleet was still deployed, set out in a year's-radius 
hemisphere throughout the skein while the Affronter's fleet of tricked 
Culture craft gathered together and opened their armament and 
armour systems to the scrutiny and control of the Killing Time and its 
comrades.  The Affronter officers were transferred aboard the Killing 

Time still in their space suits while the GSV What Is The Answer And 
Why? quickly readied secure accommodation for them.

The Sleeper briefly considered trying to stop the smaller craft.  The 
GCU was heading out past it for the thirty-light-year limit, straight 
towards the Excession and still accelerating. 

The GSV decided to let it go.  Its engines would fail… about now. 

Fail they did, but just before they stopped working the Grey 
Area carried out a bizarre course manoeuvre, angling its run so that 
it was falling towards the energy grid; it would coast without power 
down to the grid and be destroyed. 

Madness, thought the Sleeper, but was too far away to do anything. 

What has happened?  Why are you doing this?  Has your integrity 
been compromised?

No!  I'm fine! 

The GSV inspected the resulting shell of energies.  It certainly looked 
like destruction.  The Sleeper studied that final flicker the GCU had 
given just before it had encountered the grid.  It still looked like it 
had been destroyed, but there was just a hint… 

A human would have shaken her or his head. 

When the Sleeper returned its attention to the Excession, it had 
gone.  There was nothing present on the skein of real space, and no 
sign of even the merest disturbance on either of the energy grids. 

No! thought the Sleeper Service, experiencing a terrible sense of 
frustration. No!  Damn you!  Don't just go, not without some sort of 
reason, some explanation, some rationale…

Ulver Seich sat on the parapet of the tower, swinging her legs.  From 
the roof, it looked like you could see out over an ocean in one 
direction and a landscape of sea marsh, water meadow and cliffs in 
the other.  It was perfectly convincing but it was just a projection; 
the bird had tried flying out in a spiral and only got a couple of metres 
out from the tower's edge before one of its wings had encountered 
the solid boundary of the screen field.  It was perched on the parapet 
at the girl's side now, looking gloomily out at the troubled waves of 
the sea. 

'Bugger,' Ulver said, half to herself. 'It's gone.' She kept a watch on 
developments outside through her neural lace while she looked down 
at the bird. 'The Excession,' she told it. 'It's just disappeared.' 

'Good riddance,' the bird said grouchily. 

'And the Grey Area flew into the grid,' Ulver said, her voice trailing 
off for a moment while she inquired what had happened to Churt 
Lyne. 'Ah,' she said, discovering the old drone was safe aboard the 
GSV. 

'Pah,' said the bird. 'It was always a nutter anyway, by all 
accounts.  What's its highness doing?' 

'What?' 

'The Sleeper.  Don't suppose it's showing any sign of wanting to end 
it all, is it?' 

'No, it's just… stationary there.' 

'Too much to hope for,' muttered the bird. 

Ulver kept on gazing out at the sea and swinging her legs.  She 
glanced back at the pallid bulge of the translucent dome. 'Wonder 
how they're getting on?' 

'Want me to find out?' the bird said, brightening. 

'No.  Just you stay where you are.' 

'I don't know,' the creature grumbled. 'Every bastard seems to enjoy 
ordering me around…' 

'Oh, do be quiet,' Ulver told it. 

'See what I mean?' 

'Shut up.'

Fivetide dived for the bat ball and missed; he thumped heavily into 
the court wall and up-ended.  He lay on his back, wheezing and 
laughing on the floor until Onceman Genar-Hofoen limbed over to 
him, extended a tentacle and helped him haul himself upright. 

'Fifteen all, I think,' he rumbled, also laughing.  He scooped the 
twittering bat ball up in his racket and ladled it into Fivetide's. 'Your

I still say it was somehow a test; an emissary.  We were tried and 
found wanting.  It encountered the worst of what we can be and took 
itself off again.  Probably in disappointment.  Possibly in disgust.  The 
Affront were too disagreeable, the Elench were too eager, we too 
hesitant.  Our slow gathering of supposedly wise ones about its 
vicinity might have proved to be a perfectly reaεsonable course of 
action and led to who knows what exchanges, tradings and dialogues, 
but the entity found itself surrounded by all the trappings of war and 
may even have understood the manner in which its appearance had 
been used as part of a plot to entrap the Affront so that they could 
be laid low and have a Cultured peace imposed upon them.  It judged 
us unworthy of intercourse with those it represented and so 
abandoned us to our miserable fate.  Those noxious simpletons who 
made up the conspiracy should be cursed for evermore; they may 
have cost us more than even we can imagine.  The displays of 
contrition and programmes of good works that have been 
undertaken, even the suicides, cannot begin to make amends for 
what we have lost!  How is Seddun at this time of year?  Do the 
islands still float?

My dear friend, we do not know what the Excession offered or 
threatened.  We know it was able to manipulate the energy grid in 
ways we can only speculate upon, but what if that was the only form 
of defence it was able to offer to something like the Sleeper Service? 
For all we know it was an invasionary beach-head which left us 
because it was met with forces which it estimated presaged resistance 
on a scale which would prove too expensive.  I admit this is unlikely, 
but I offer it as a balancing possibility in the hope of righting the list 
of your pessimism. 

At any rate, we are arguably better off than before; a conspiracy has 
been uncovered, any other zealots thinking of indulging in similar 
pranks will have been roundly discouraged, and even the Affront are 
behaving a little better having realised how close they came to being 
taught such a severe and salutary lesson.  The war itself never really 
got going, there was little loss of life and Affronter reparations for the 
mischief they did create will serve as a minor but nagging reminder 
of the liabilities which follow on such aggression for some 
considerable time to come.  The implicit lesson of the Sleeper 
Service's effectively instantly produced war machine will similarly not 
have been lost on any other species who might also have been 
planning Affronter-like adventures, I suspect. 

As to the chance we may have missed, well, call me an old bore if 
you will, but who knows what changes might have attended a 
meaningful dialogue with whatever the Excession represented (if it 
represented anything other than itself - again, we can only 
speculate). 

In all this, the seeming indifference of the Elder civilisations still 
strikes me as one of the most puzzling aspects of the affair.  Were 
they really just indifferent?  Did the Excession have nothing to teach 
those who have Sublimed?  There is much here still to be answered, 
though I suspect the wait could be long; even infinitely so! 

Well, the debate will doubtless continue for a long time to come.  I 
confess I am finding the fame and even adulation that has befallen 

us somewhat tiring.  I'm considering a retreat, after I've finished 
going round apologising to those who were involved without their 
knowledge in this. 

Seddun is beautiful in winter (Visual file enclosed).  As you see, the 
islands float on, even in the ice.  Genar-Hofoen's uncle Tish sends his 
regards and has forgiven us.

Leffid held the lass in his arms and gazed happily out through the 
yacht's wide port-screen at the darkness of space.  One bright edge 
of Tier was visible, rotating in all its silent majesty.  Leffid thought it 
had never looked so beautiful.  He gazed down at the sleeping face 
of his angel.  Her name was Xipyeong.  Xipyeong.  What a beautiful 
name. 

It was love this time, he was sure of it; he had found his soul-
mate.  They had only met the week before, only been together for a 
couple of nights, but he just knew.  Why, for one thing, he hadn't 
forgotten her name once! 

She stirred and woke, her eyes coming slowly open.  She frowned 
briefly, then smiled, nuzzling him and saying, 'Hey, Geffid…'

Ulver reined Brave in.  The great animal snorted and came to a halt 
at the crest of the ridge.  She loosened the reins to let the animal Put 
its head down and crop the grass by the rocks.  Beyond, the curved 
land dipped and rose; the ridge looked down over a forest and a 
winding river then out over rolling downland dotted with houses and 
coppices of trees.  Overhead, one of Phage's larger lakes glittered in 
the sunlight. 

Ulver looked back to see the rest following behind; Otiel, Peis, Klatsli 
and her brother and the others.  She laughed.  Their mounts were 
picking their way gingerly through the stone-field; Brave had taken it 
at a gallop. 

The black bird Gravious settled on a nearby rock.  Ulver grinned at it. 
'See?' she said, taking a great, deep, happy breath and waving one 
gloved hand out at the view. 'Isn't it beautiful here?  Didn't I tell 
you?  Aren't you glad you came?' 

'It's all right, I suppose,' Gravious conceded. 

Ulver laughed.

They looked around, in the midst of an undreamt splendour. 

~ Now this was a view worth risking everything for, the Grey 
Area sent. 

~ I think we can all agree with that, agreed the Peace Makes Plenty. 

~ If they could see us now… mused the Break Even.

Ren ran down the sands and into the water, shrieking and laughing 
and splashing.  Her long blonde hair turned darker in the water and 
lay stuck to her skin when she ran back out again.  She skipped up 
to where her mother, Zreyn and Amorphia sat on a gaily patterned 
rug under a lacy parasol.  The girl threw herself at her aunt Zreyn, 
who grinned and caught her, then let her wriggle free and dash off 
along the beach, running towards a sea bird which had thought to 
doze off there; it flapped lazily into the air and flew slowly off, pursued 
by the whooping child. 

The girl disappeared round the side of the long, single-storey house 
which lay in the dunes behind the beach; the decorated edges of its 

On the porch, the image of Gestra Ishmethit sat, peering intently at 
the partially built model of a sailing ship sitting on a table.  The man 
himself had his own suite of rooms, off one of the Sleeper 
Service's warship-stacked General Bays, but he had been persuaded, 
by Ren, to allow his real-time image to join them most days, and had 
even started to appear personally for important celebrations.  These 
consisted mostly of Ren's birthdays, which according to her occurred 
on a weekly basis. 

Zreyn Tramow looked over at Dajeil. 'Have you ever thought,' she 
said, 'of asking the ship to re-create the old place where you used to 
live?' 

'There's still a version of it in that Limited Bay, isn't there?' Dajeil 
said, looking at Amorphia.  The avatar, which sported a simple black 
pant-skirt and skin which looked like it would never tan, was holding 
a long blonde hair up to the sun-line, and peering at it.  It realised it 
was being talked to and looked at Dajeil. 

'What?' it said, then, 'Oh, yes; the bay where Genar-Hofoen was 
kept.  Yes; the tower's still there.' 

'See?' Dajeil told Zreyn.  She rolled along the rug, out of the parasol's 
shade, closed her eyes, put her hands under her head and lay on her 
belly, to even up her tan. 

'I meant the whole thing,' Zreyn said, stretching out on the rug. 'The 
cliffs and everything.  Even the climate, if that's possible,' she said, 
glancing at the avatar, which was still studying the sunlight through 
one of Ren's blonde hairs. 'Perfectly possible,' it muttered. 

'The whole thing?' Dajeil said, grimacing. 'But it's so much nicer like 
this.' She reached out across the sand and pulled a straw sun-hat 
over her head. 

Zreyn shrugged. 'I'd just like to see it do stuff like that, I suppose.' 
She looked up at the sun-line. 'Making and moving all that rock, 

creating small oceans… You have to remember I don't take all 
this… power for granted the way you do.' 

Dajeil folded the sun hat's brim up and squinted at the other woman, 
who made an awkward gesture. 

'Sorry; is my primitiveness showing?' 

Zreyn Tramow's stored mind-state had been woken up to tell her that 
her 
name 
at 
least 
had 
been 
used 
in 
the 
discovered 

conspiracy.  The Sleeper Service had been uncertain about whether 
this was really necessary, but it was the sort of thing that extreme 
politeness dictated, and in the aftermath of the brief war, everybody 
was being almost exquisitely correct.  Besides, it had a hunch that 
she might find the current civilisational situation interesting enough 
to be re-born, and it rather liked the idea of instigating such a 
response.  The Sleeper Service had been right; Zreyn Tramow had 
thought the galaxy sounded like a place worth revisiting and had duly 
been grown a new body, but then, after the ship had stuck around, 
impatiently, 
while 
the 
various 
post-debacle 
inquiries 
and 

investigations had been carried out, she'd asked to go with it when it 
had announced it still intended to go on a rambling retreat. 

Gestra Ishmethit, his mind-state plucked from his dying brain in the 
evacuated cold of the warship halls in Pittance by the guilt-
stricken Attitude Adjuster, appropriated from that craft just before it 
destroyed itself by the attacking Killing Time and subsequently 
passed on until it came to rest in the restocked memory vaults of 
the Sleeper Service, had also been woken up and furnished with a 
new body by that time; death had neither improved his social skills 
nor sated his urge for solitude and he too had asked to remain aboard 
the giant ship. 

He, Ren, Dajeil and Zreyn were its only passengers. 

'Yes, you're being a hick; stop it at once,' Dajeil told Zreyn, who 
shrugged.  Dajeil glanced round at the dunes, the golden sand and 
the bright blue sky. 'Anyway, it's a long journey,' she said. 'Maybe 
we'll get bored with all this and want it all changed back to the way 
it was.' 

'Just let me know,' Amorphia said. 

Dajeil took another look round.  'I'm glad I let you talk me into 
remaking the old place like this, Amorphia,' she said. 

'Pleased you like it,' the avatar said, nodding. 

'Have you decided where we're going yet?' Zreyn asked. 

The avatar nodded. 'I think… Leo II,' it said. 

'Not Andromeda?' Zreyn said. 

Amorphia shook its head. 'I changed my mind.' 

'Damn,' Zreyn said. 'I always wanted to go to Andromeda.' 

'Too crowded,' Amorphia said. 

Zreyn looked unconvinced. 

'We could go there… afterwards?' the avatar suggested. 

'Will we even live to see Leo II?' Dajeil asked, opening her eyes and 
gazing over at the creature. 

The avatar looked apologetic. 'It will take rather a long time,' it 
admitted. 

Dajeil closed her eyes again. 'You could always Store us,' she said. 
'Think you could manage that?' 

Zreyn laughed lightly. 

'Oh, I could give it a try,' the avatar said.
