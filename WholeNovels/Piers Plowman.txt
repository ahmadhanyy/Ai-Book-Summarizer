INTRODUCTION
,

In
bringing
before the reader a version of
this amazing

book, I wish, as in the case of my edition of the Canterbury

Tales, to disarm,
if I can, the criticism of the scholar.
My

version
is not intended
in any
sense
for those who can

read with ease the alliterative poems of the fourteenth or

earlier
centuries.
Knowing,
however,
that
it
requires

very careful study to read
Piers Plowman with ease and

pleasure, I have occasionally omitted and always simplified.

I have tried
to preserve and bring out the meaning,
the

careless
alliteration,
and
the
elusive
rhythm.
I
have

regularly modernised the spelling, and have indeed followed
the example set by the most learned editor of the poem,
who has himself published a modernised text: indeed there
are several of such texts in the market.
This,
as
in the

case
of
the
Chaucer,
is
the whole
of my
offence.
The

specialist will find echoes from M. Jusserand and Professor
Skeat everywhere.

Piers Plowman is regarded as the poor mans book.
But,

though
I hope the
spirit
is
preserved,
I have
resolutely

avoided by any phrase reading into
it a special message

for to-day.
A comment with notes inwoven has
indeed

called
attention
to
singular
survivals,
parallels
in
social

life, but these parallels would, even without the reference

to them, force themselves upon the attention of any one.

Much has been made about the confusion in the poem;

but the main scheme is perfectly clear.
Under the favourite

form of a vision,
it
is
a
picture and an arraignment
of

the England of Edward III. and Richard
II.
As the first

Isaiah, said to have been a young aristocrat, listened to the

call in the Temple, and
left a
life of ease to act for thirty

years as the unsparing critic of the Jerusalem and Judah
of
his day,
so per contra our
author,
a man
of humble

extraction,
it would
seem,
and
of no
social
pretension,

hurled
his
invective,
his
satire, and
his grim fun at the

London and the England of Chaucers time.
He
is an Old

vii

viii
Piers Plowman

Testament prophet with English humour added to Hebrew

seriousness.
We
are, whatever we think of the question

of authorship, in the presence of one who when in earnest

is terribly
in
earnest, whether he
is describing the great

plain which
lies below Malvern
Hills,
or the marriage of

Jobbery
to
Falsehood,
or the
shriving
of Gluttony and

Wrath,
or the
iniquities
of the hated lawyers
at West-

minster, or the beauty of Charity, or the triumphant march
on Hell by Piers Plowman, the man Christ Jesus.
Picture

after
picture
paints
the same
story,
preaches
the same

sermon;
and
the story and the sermon
are
these.
The

world
is good enough
if man were not so bad;
the birds

sing blissfully enough
if underneath there droned not on

the note of misery;
life
is sweet and jolly enough
if men

were not so bitter;
Malvern
Hills are fair enough
if only

in the
plain,
in the great Field Full of Folk, there were

more charity, more honesty, more simplicity, more useful
work, and a greater wish to set forth on the great pilgrimage.
This pilgrimage
is not
to Canterbury or Walsingham or

Compostella or Rome ;
it is a pilgrimage to Truth, the saint

whom men so regularly disregard.

" Knowest thou a holy saint
that men call Truth?

Canst thou tell us of the way
where that saint dwelleth? "

" God bless me, nay,"
quoth this fellow then.

" Never saw
I palmer
with pike-staff and with scrip,

That asked after Truth
till ye now in this place."

Instead
of seeking Truth, men
seek money;
instead
of

honouring Love, they honour Wrath;
instead of dealing

honestly, they bow down before Pride, Flattery, Bribery,
Corruption, and Jobbery, branded under the title of Lady
Meed, who
is the
thin
disguise
of Alice
Perrers,
the
in-

famous mistress of Edward
III.
Kings are weak, barons

are cats that seize and poss about the people of the realm,
knights are idle hunters, lawyers are thieves; monks and
nuns
are no better than they should
be, merchants
are

swindlers, bankers are coin-clippers, and
all the wonderful

array
of papal
officers and
English churchmen are mere

plunderers of the land,
pocket-fillers, and cheaters of the

people.
As for Friars, " there was one good Friar,
in the

days of Francis, but that was long ago."
Neither Wit nor

Learning, Scripture nor Imagination, helps the seeker one

Introduction

jot
in
his pilgrimage;
words, words, words, are the end

of them.
The working man, God save the mark,
is an

idler, a drinker, a spoil-work, a wastrel, a loafer, and an
unemployable;
the
professional
beggar,
with
limbs
pro-

fessionally broken for his trade,
is no worse than he;
and

ruffling Regulars,
covetous
lords,
cheating shopmen,
idle

priests,
lying pilgrims, and
fine-furred
harlots,
jostle one

another in the chaos of the scene.
Through
all, warning

all, and at times tearing and punishing all, stalk the shadow
forms of Plague and Storm and Famine, regularly visiting
England,
God's messengers
to
the generation
that have

clean forgotten Him; and though Piers Plowman may go
down to Hell and fetch Humanity from Satan's grip, yet
there
rises the dread shape of Antichrist and sweeps that

sweet and gentle figure from the scene; " and it was night."

This
is the
first impression that one gets
of the book

known as Piers Plowman ; but it is a first impression only.
Another reading shows another side.
Kings may be weak,

but they
are resolved
to deal sharply with Lady Meed.

Reason and Conscience have by no means
left the land;

they
plead
passionately
for
the
punishment
of Wrong

(the king's officer).
Barons and knights are not all wicked;

they can rule far better than the people could who would
try
their hand at government;
and
it
is they who
will,

when the time comes, bring the Church to the bar of judg-
ment.
Gentlemen are willing and even
anxious, though

almost impotent, to help against the disorders of the day;
some lawyers here and there will plead for God's poor and
take no
fee
for
it;
some monks and nuns stay
in
their

convents, some hermits in their cells, and there they work
or pray;
some honesty
is
still left in trade;
and a bishop

here and there knows his business, and parish priests here
and there do not skip away to London, but stay in their
parishes and comfort and feed their people.
Unity and Peace

and Conscience and Charity never cease to do their work

in the human heart, and they raise the banner of the Christ

in the
field of Armageddon.
The working man, the real,

true, leal, honest, uncomplaining, working man,
is up early

and hard at work for very few pence;
the cottage woman

holds her head up and " puts a good face on it; " some of the
beggars are Christ's poor who can perforce do nothing but

lie as Lazarus did at Dives' door
;
and in the mob that fill

x
Piers Plowman

the
Malvern
plain,
stretching
to
Worcester
roofs,
are

honest
traders, good
ancres, and a stray woman
of
the

streets,
eager
for
the
great
pilgrimage.
Through
all,

warning all, encouraging
all, comes at length, though fore-

shadowed throughout the former scenes, an ordinary man.
Piers Plowman1

, the people's man, the people's Christ, poor

humanity adorned with love, hardworking humanity armed
with indignation, sympathetic humanity clad in the intelli-
gence that knows all and—makes allowances;
at one time

setting high-born ladies to work,
at another passionately

attacking
the
insolent
priest,
at
another
calling
upon

Famine to help him against the loafing, growling wastrel

of the streets;
but always encouraging the penitent sinful,

helping the weak, leading the way
in the great journey;

a
strange
figure,
Christ
in
humanity,
humanity
Christ-

clothed, neither all a poor man, nor all a ploughman, nor all
a
Jesus, but fading and vanishing and reappearing
in
all

forms of his humanised divinity, and ending as the Christ
conqueror that from the Cross went down and burst the
doors and
defied
the brazen guns
of
hell, and
brought

Piers Plowmans Fruit home with victory ;
yet, even in this

majestic
battle with Lucifer and
Belial, Ragamuffin and

Goblin, no omnipotent God far removed from the cares and
sorrows of fourteenth-century England, but

One like the Good Samaritan
and somewhat like Piers Plowman,

Barefoot, bootless,
without spur or spear,

Riding on an asses back,
brightly he looked

Like one that cometh to be dubbed knight,
To get him his gilt spurs
and his slashed shoon.

This
is the general picture of the poem, or of such parts

as are here wholly or partly transcribed.

The teaching of the book
is negative in that, in face of

the tremendous
issues,
it counsels no opposition to King,

Church, Barons, or Knights.
It is not inflammatory
;
it is

no
harbinger
of
the
Reformation,
though
it
contains a

startling prophecy of that great event.
It cannot be looked

upon as anti-papal, though
it was written
in the time of

the Great Schism
;
it distinctly disbelieves in the extremes

of what the modern world calls democracy, although moral

collectivism
is
its watchword;
and
it nowhere gives any

support to the notion that
it foresaw the coming
of the

great revolt of
1381,
or approved of that revolt when
it

Introduction
xi

came.
It seems, notwithstanding a few political allusions,

to be as remote from politics as are the Gospels themselves,
and for the same reason.
No form of government,
it would

say,
is in itself bad,
if men have the religious spirit;
every

form of government is bad
if they have it not.

On the other hand, the teaching of the book
is positive

enough, in that it puts its finger on the abuses of the time,

lawlessness, falseness, dishonesty, jobbery, money-grubbing,
luxury, and idleness.
Idleness of all things it cannot away

with;
the idle rich are scourged as much as the idle poor;

idleness, with all its accompanying evils—begging, gluttony,
dishonourable
dealing,
simony,
neglect
of
plain
duty,

luxury senseless and unbridled, idleness is the unpardonable

sin;
and
Professor Minto has sketched
a curious
parallel

between this poem and the teaching of Thomas Carlyle, who
possibly never had the book in his hands.
If the undecided

king
is the victim of his circumstances, the wasters among

the rich are what they are because they have not enough
true work to do.
The same may be said of the unworthy

prelate—he does not do
his
true work.
It may equally

be
said
of
pardoner,
merchant,
knight,
lady,
hermit,

pilgrim,
huckster and
hewer,
ditcher and
delver.
Truth

(who stands confusedly for God the Father) rules that each
man should have his work and do it well
;
and the heaviest

condemnation of Truth
is for those in all ranks of life who

instead
of working go a-hunting
or
sit by the road and

sing " Hey Trolly Lolly " and " God save you, Lady Em."
Piers Plowman himself preaches work ; he puts his mittens
on and hangs a basket round his neck, a mock pilgrim, and

off he goes to plough his half-acre.
Indeed, the motto of the

poem might be E\cr M\n must Plough hi^ Half-Acre;
but
it
must
be
ploughed
without
the
thought
of
self-

enrichment
at the cost
of others.
Work
is not enough;

Pride
and
Flattery
work,
traitors
work,
lechers
work,

disers and minstrels work, thieves work, Liar works for the

Friars,
the
Friars themselves work, merchants and
their

'prentices
work,
the
Pardoner works hard—they
are
all

Judas children.
It
is not enough
to work;
a man must

work
honestly
for
himself and
for
his
fellows;
he must

work for his religion, for his king, and for his country.

In the humorous section dealing with
his own
life, the

writer condemns himself for idleness;
and we in our day

xii
Piers Plowman

should say he condemns himself with justice.
His definite

teaching is that of the Gospel, " The poor ye have always
with you: more shame to you.
Your rich England should

have no poor:
it is your bounden duty to rid the world of

the miserably
poor, and
you can do
it
if you
will, by

making all work for all."
" The poor ye shall have always

with you "
is a text he never refers to, because he knows

that he cannot find it in the Gospels.
No autocrat can be

more severe than he upon those who will not work.
He

has one word
for the able-bodied
loafer, and one alone:

"Starve him; " and he knows that such an heroic remedy
had not been tried in his own day, any more than
it has

been tried since.

Along with this gospel of true work for self and others,

for home and country,
is
his
definite preaching of home

sympathy.
England for England is his cry throughout the

poem.
He hates to see the Pope meddle in the appoint-

ment of foreigners to livings that have not fallen vacant;
he hates to see men carry good English money to Avignon
or Rome;
he hates to see men make pilgrimages to
St.

James and
St. Peter, when
the pilgrimages they should

make are to jails and hospitals, and to their poorer neigh-
bours cottages.
If Englishmen go to Sinai and Bethlehem

to seek the
saints,
for Gods sake
let them stay
there, he

says; we want no such pilgrims here.
You can find your

true pilgrimage by going the round of your own parish.

Again, he is definite enough, as we should expect, in his

demand for a clean
life.
The King has his Alice Perrers;

she must go;
the bishops have their lemans, the hermits

and
pilgrims
their
girls;
the beggars breed
like
rabbits,

and are never married.
Luxury, lust, and lechery spell the

same thing
for him, and with unnecessary wealth comes

unnecessary
wantonness.
In
passage
after
passage
he

declaims against the fatal gift of Constantine and legacies
to the Church: religion goes a-hunting with a pack of hounds
at his tail, and with this wealth in money and lands comes
the
ill
life, the
life of wantonness.
Stained windows and

gorgeous churches, fine vestments and full church pockets,
are as much anathema
to him
as
are
the
evil deeds of

Richard II. and of the king's officers who pay the poor in

receipts instead of in money, and who rob the honest worker

of his horse, of his wife's honour, and his maid's innocence.

Introduction
xiii

He pleads too for a saner education and
for wholesome

correction.
The working man
is told
to go and get two

sticks and beat his
idle wife;
another
is blamed because

his wife's bonnet costs three pounds and his own cost five

shillings.
The gentleman cockers his children because he

is afraid
of their catching the plague;
he never takes a

stick to them.
" Spare the switch and
spill the son "
is

to him a maxim equally true if it be applied to idler, wife,

thief, beggar, or child.
He praises the good
school, and

laments that not enough money is spent in what we should

call scholarships.

Finally, he devoutly prays that the Church will reform

herself, and prophesies that
if she will not do so the king

and the barons will reform her in a way she will not like:
and for the idler he begs that Famine will return to England,

for only in the sharp correction of drought and hunger will
England learn her lesson.
That she will learn it finally he

cannot hope ;
for after Calvary comes Antichrist, and Pride

and Flattery regain their places ; and with this his indignant

spirit passes sadly into the dark.

No one can quite tell how far the author represents the

true picture of his time.
He is in general agreement with

Chaucer, who was as earnest as he:
any one will see this

who cares to look below the surface of the Canterbury Tales.

It is the custom to say Chaucer is the poet of the rich and
Langland
of
the
poor;
that
Chaucer
laughed
at
and

tolerated with Horatian sang-froid the
foibles,
the
vices,

and even the miseries of his day.
Nothing, to my mind,

can be further from the truth;
and the plain fact
is that

while Langland
is
sardonic,
indignant,
fierce, you never

know when you turn a page of Chaucer how near you are
to tears;
and
it must be remembered by those who con-

sider Chaucer an aristocrat and Langland a democrat, that
Chaucers poems include the figures of the Parson, Janicula,

Griselda,
the
old man
of
the
Pardoners
Tale, and
the

numberless pictures of the good and charitable rich.

The questions that surround
this poem
as a text are

most
difficult.
The reader may be referred to Professor

Skeats monumental edition, of which
it
is needless to say

I have made the fullest use;
to Professor Manlys chapter

in the second volume of the Cambridge History of English

Literature ; to Jusserands beautiful and loving studies of the

xiv
Piers Plowman

poem;
and
to
the bibliography given
in
the Cambridge

History.
Any one, however, who would feel the poem as it

ought
to be
felt must have
in
his hands,
if only
for an

hour, two books, first a black letter copy of the poem which

in
these days
of
reprints
cries
aloud
for
publicity,
and

secondly
the volume
in which Bishop
Stubbs
in
a
fine

spirit of recognition has written
of our author,
Christ in

English Literature.

We do not know for certain what was the original form

of the poem;
nor do we know when, how, or with what

object the great additions to this form were made.
The

criterion
of
allusion
will not
fully
serve
as a means
for

settling dates;
for when a work written before the days of

printing
is being, through forty years or more, constantly

altered, contemporary allusion may creep in at any time.
The utmost that can, at the present moment, be asserted
without fear of contradiction
is that the poem was written

between
1360 and
1400;
that
it was constantly and
in

many
cases
carelessly
revised, and
large
additions were

made;
that
it was known well
in some form
by
1381,

when a part at least of
its teaching and the name of
its

central
figure,
Piers Plowman, were made free use of by

the leaders of the mob which broke into London, hung the
archbishop, killed the lawyers, and dragged the Flemings
out of the churches to butcher them in the streets, and that

traditionally
it has thus been, most unfairly, regarded as

the herald and literary expression of that mysterious,
ill-

timed, and
unsuccessful movement.
The
reader will do

well to bear in mind that though the temptation to enlarge
upon such an unprecedented event as the sack of part of
London must have been great, there is no word in the latest

recension of this poem to describe, praise or condemn the
movement of Wat Tyler, John Straw, or the Rev. John Ball.
Most editors explain this allusion-silence of the last recension
by saying the poet was afraid,
in consequence of the re-

action following, to refer to the uprising of the people;
I

would rather see in his abjuration of revolt, in his failure to

describe the revolt, a continuation of the attitude always
adopted by him, that what England needed was a change

of
heart and
not
an
exchange
of
purses.
The
hateful

relapses
into savagery which marked

the

French
Revolution,
and
the

would be to him the negation of the spirit of Piers Plowman,
and the throwing away of
all that men of
all classes have

laboriously
acquired
in
the domain
of
legislation,
self-

government, and self-control.
Thus I hold, while admiring

greatly
the
historical
novel
called
Long
Will,
that
the

talented
authoress, Miss Florence Converse, has erred
in

her interpretation of the part played by the author and his
poem
in
the troublesome days and
awful
scenes which

marked the year 1381.

And
if one
is uncertain about the exact date of com-

position, we are
still more in doubt as to the authorship.

The poem
is
attributed
variously to Robert
or William

Langland of Cleobury Mortimer and to William Langley;
but no
outside
allusion
of any importance save that
of

tradition
tells
us who
the
writer
was.
We
gather
his

biography,
if
it can
so be
called,
from
his work.
The

humorous
description
of
himself
occurring
only
in
one

text may have been added at any date and by any chantry

priest or other person, and
it is impossible to say what he

means by
it;
and
this section, the fable of the rats, the

long additions which follow Gods bull of pardon, and the
interludes of
the Harrowing
of
Hell and the Coming
of

Antichrist, seem
to the
present
editor
to
point
to
the

composite character of the authorship, a composite character
strongly maintained by Professor Manly and
denied by

Jusserand.
It is often forgotten that when a poem dealing

with social miseries is produced it may be made a vehicle to
represent the feelings and aspirations of thousands more
than the author;
and that when
in addition
it becomes

popular and
is written
in an
easily imitable form, many

hands, authorised and unauthorised,
set to work to help,

alter,
continue,
strengthen,
weaken,
and
enlarge.
One

thinks instinctively of the Book of Psalms, the prophecies
of Isaiah, the plays of Shakespeare, the Sonnets of Shake-
speare,
the
Wiclif
Bible,
the Anglo-Saxon
Gospels,
the

Iliad and
the
Odyssey,
all
of which were
(and some
of

which are still) assigned to one individual author or editor,
though
criticism
has
in
nearly
every
case
disputed
the

absolute
claims
set up
for
David,
Isaiah,
Shakespeare,

Wiclif, Alfred, and Homer respectively.
Such a composite

authorship,
I
think,
is the only
thing that
will account

for the almost senseless
" improvements " which we con-

xvi
Piers Plowman

tinually meet with in the latest text:
and
I believe that a

careful comparative study of the texts themselves will do
more
to
clear up
difficulties
than
any
reasoning
from

history
or
allusion.
Such study
the poem
has not yet

received.
The
metre
and
dialect
have
received
fullest

attention;
but
they
yield more
information
about
the

•scribes than about the author.
Yet the scribes themselves

may have been the chief offenders.

If we try to
reconstruct from a
careful
reading what

manner
of man or men penned
these
visions, we might

arrive at some picture like the following.
They were or he

was a man who loved the country for its birds and flowers,
but loved London better for its people; who had been to
school and
read and remembered
eagerly and
lovingly,

with greater intelligence than care, the Latin Bible and the
Latin
Fathers;
who
lived a
precarious,
poor,
tramping

life of mass or chantry priest, earning little and continually
consorting,
partly by choice and partly by
necessity,
in

the most intimate way, with friars, theologians, merchants,

pilgrims,
beggars, drunkards,
loose women, and with the

honest and hard-working poor;
who knew
all the
tricks

of shop and cheaping, of mendicancy and mendacity ; who
was not averse from honest idleness, and who was stung

to penitence and indignation by what he saw, heard, and

felt in himself and
in those around him;
who hated the

trickery, the aristocracy, and
intricacies
of law which he

did
not
understand, and who
loved
the
scenes
in
the

gentleman's dining-hall and in the taverns, where he was
quite at home;
who abhorred—perhaps with envy—the

easy
life of the rich noble and the fat priest; who by his

reading,
his
monastic
training,
and
his
own
poverty

imagined that the saviour of society would come from and
belong to the only class he thoroughly understood;
who

wrote roughly the rough alliterative verse, indigenous to the
land and very pedestrian, but who in
his inspired hours,

which were many, almost rose, notwithstanding his awkward

tools, to the spiritual heights of Bunyan and Shelley and

to the poetic heights of the Old Testament prophets.
Like

Bunyan and Shelley, he lived in stormy times;
like them,

he had, as an individual, been through some of the moral
cataclysms of which he spoke;
like them, he was prone to

fall, but ready
to
rise;
but he did not use the nervous

Introduction
xvii

beauty
of Bunyans
prose
or
the metaphysical wings
of

Shelleys
scholarship,
strengthened by
his
unearthly and

Titanic force.
This, however, was his advantage,
for his

work
was
capable
of
being
enlarged
and
successfully

imitated.
For
he
wrote
for
the
ordinary
man,
who,

whether he be king or baron, bishop or pardoner, merchant
or Lombard, hermit or pilgrim, knight or knave, may,
if

his heart counsel him, echo the last words:

THE VISION OF THE FIELD FULL

OF FOLK

In a summer season,
when soft was the sun,

In rough cloth I robed me,
as I a shepherd were,

In habit like a hermit
in his works unholy,

And through the wide world I went, wonders to hear.

But on a May morning,
A marvel befel me

I had wandered me weary,
On a broad bank
And as I lay and leaned

I slumbered in a sleeping,
And I dreamed—marvellously.

All the worlds weal,
Truth and trickery,

All I saw, sleeping.

I was in a wilderness,
And eastward I looked

I saw a Tower on an hill,
Beneath it a Dell,
With deep ditches and dark
And Death and wicked spirits
And all between,

on Malvern hills,
—sure from Faery it came

so weary, I rested me
by a merry-sounding burn;
and looked into the waters

it rippled so merrily,

all the worlds woe,

treason and guile,

wist I not where,

against the sun.

fairly fashioned,
and in the Dell a dungeon,
and dreadful to see,

dwelt therein,
between the Hill and Dungeon,

A FAIR FIELD

Rich and poor,
Working and wandering

Set their seed and sowed their

To win what wastrels

Some were for pride,

Some

Living strait lives

In hope of heavenly bliss,

Anchorites, hermits,
And coveted not to roam
Nor with dainty living

Some chose merchandise;

And some were for music,

With wit enough to work,

Crammed with bread

{The writer digresses)

What trouble and mischance
Through two false priests,
They were discomfited
And for Eli saw them sin
And chastened them not
As
it was prophesied,

And Elis sons were slain.
From his chair where he sat
And brake his neck a-two.

All this was Gods vengeance,
And, since they were priests
God was the angrier

Therefore
ye
priests
and

Churchmen

Ye who should their fathers be
God shall take vengeance,
Than ever on Eli,
For your wicked tolerance,
Your mass and your mattins
Are done undevoutly;

Christ in his consistory

fell on free Israel,
Ophni and Phineas.

and suffered their evil,

I know well the power
that Peter had to keep,

To bind and unbind,
as the Book telleth.

He left the power, with love,
to the four virtues

Cardinal virtues,
for they close the gates,

Heavens gates, where Christ dwelleth.
But of court cardinals

Presuming of themselves

And holding the power

And for profit of all men

To till and work,

To

Then looked up a lean lunatic
" Christ keep thee, sir king,
" And grant thee so to rule,
" And thou,

and knelt and said,

that loyalty may love thee

Then bent an angel down,
and spake for the poors sake,

Who cannot jangle in the courts
and plead their cause aright,

But they must serve and^suffer,

That was the Fathers deed,
And looked on us with love,
Meekly for our misdeeds.

Yet kneeled I on my knees,

" Look on thy left hand,

I looked on my left hand,
And was ware of a woman,
Her robe fur-edged,
Crowned with a crown,

Fairly her fingers
And in the rings red rubies,
And diamonds of dearest price,

I wondered who she was,

red gold, rare stones;

such riches saw I never;
and whose wife she were.

" What is this woman," said I,
" so wonderly clad? "

Quoth she, " That is Meed the

THE MARRIAGE OF MEED

When she had gone from me

All the rich retinue,
Were bidden to the bridal,

Knights, clerks and commons,

Sheriffs and sheriffs men,

Middlemen, brokers,
No reckoning the rout

I looked and beheld

whose root is false-living,

poor and rich,
jurymen and summoners,

beadles and bailiffs,

victuallers, pleaders;

that ran at Meeds heels.

They sent Simony
to seal the papers,

That Falsehood and Flattery
for their fines held,

To make them over
Meeds dowry for ever.

There was no hall nor house
that could harbour the people,

And EVERY FIELD WAS FULL OF FOLK.

On a mountain, in midst of it,
at mid-morning tide,

They pitched a proud pavilion,
For knights from afar
For jurors, for summoners,

For the flattering Friars,
That all might witness

and ten thousand tents,
and for strange comers,

for labourers on farms,

all the Four Orders,
what the writing said,

When Meed was married to Falsehood.

Simony, Law and Juryman
But Flattery was the first
To give her away
When Simony and Lawyer
They assented thereto

were Meeds nearest friends,

to fetch her from her bower,
and join her to Falsehood,
saw their desire,
—at Silvers prayer.

Then leaped out Liar,
" That Guile with great oaths
And Simony and Lawyer

Unfolding the deed
Thus they began,

dwelling on the earth,

" A charter, a charter,

stood forth both of them

and loud they cried:

Then the doctors heard of this

And when she was attached
she wrung her hands and wept.

THE VISION OF LADY MEED TRIED

BEFORE THE KING

THE VISION OF LADY MEED TRIED

BEFORE THE KING

Now is Meed the maid,
by bedels and bailiffs,

None other with her,
brought before the king.

Then the king called a clerk,
his name I know not,

To take her and set her at ease.

" I will assay her,
myself will question her,

" What man upon earth
she loveth best,

" And if she doth wisely
and followeth my will,

" I will forgive her this guilt,
so God help me."

The clerk took Meed
and led her to the chamber;

Mirth was made and minstrelsy Meed to please withal;
They that dwell at Westminster
all honour her.

Joyfully, gently,
came the Justices

Where this beauty dwelt;
they hurried to her bower,

Gat leave of the clerk
and offered her comfort:

" Mourn not, Meed,
make thou no sorrow,

:c We will counsel the king,
we will shape thy path,

;< Thou shalt wed as thou wilt,
and whom thou wilt,

" For all that Conscience
may plot or do.

" Might and mastery
shall be

thine
and to do thine own pleasure

" With King, with Commons, and with Court."
Meed thanked them mildly
and gave to each

A cup of gold,
or a goblet of silver,

Or a ruby ring,
or other rich gift;

The least man of her crew
had a golden piece,

And with that they took their leave.

38
Piers Plowman

Then came the Clerks to comfort her;
" Be blithe,
we be thy men,

" To work thy will
while life endureth."

And Meed sweetly
" I will love you loyally,
" And get livings for you,
" And buy you benefices;
" And
your names
be
called

aloud

" If I love a clerk,
" I am well known,
" And
cunning
clerks
that

promised the same:
and make lords of you,
—while your silver lasteth

ye shall be pluralists,

no ignorance shall stay him,

he shall go forward,

shall couch behind."

Then came a Confessor,
And whispered soft
" Though gentle and simple
" And
Falsehood
kept
thee

mistress

" For a load of wheats price
" And will be thy beadsman
" Among clerks and knights

gowned like a Friar,

as though in shrift:
have lain by thy side,

this forty year,

I will assoil thee,
and will do thine errands
and Conscience defeat."

Then Meed kneeled to the man
And shrove her of her sins,

Told him a tale
To be her beadsman

for all her evil deeds,

the shameless one;
and gave him a guinea,
and her go-between.

And he assoiled her
of her sins, and said:

" We have a window a-making,
'twill cost us high,

" Wilt

Meed,

" Sure shall thy soul be

" In thine honour solemnlv

That I had not slept sounder
But ere I fared a furlong

And sat me softly down,
Babbled my prayers,

faintness took me;

for want of sleep,
and said my creed,

they brought me sleep.

I saw the FIELD FULL OF FOLK.

He proved these Pestilences

Was openly for pride,

Pear trees, plum trees,
An example, ye men,

Beeches and broad oaks

Their roots up-turned
That deadly sin at Doomsday

He bade wasters go work
And with some kind of craft

He prayed Parnel the gay
And keep it in her coffer

" In the name of God, amen,
I make this testament myself.

" He shall have my soul,
that all souls made,

" And defend it from the Fiend,
for so is my faith,

" Till I come to his account,
as my Creed telleth me,

" And gain forgiveness
of my

debts
and remission of my sins

;

" On that remission I believe.

" The Church
shall have my

body

" Of my corn and of my sub-

stance;

" I paid her readily,
" She is bound, I hope,

and shall keep my bones,

I paid her my tithes,

for peril of my soul

;

to bear me in mind,

" And keep me in her memory
with all Christian souls.

" My

shall
have
that

earned,
earned with truth and no more,

" And share it with my friends,
and my dear children.

" Though I should die to-day,
my debts are paid;

Now are Piers and the pilgrims
To plough his half-acre;
Ditchers and delvers
Thereat was Piers pleased
Others there were
Each man in his way
And some to please Perkin

Some did their work thus;
And helped to plough the half-

Threw down his glove,
a Breton man, a braggart,

Bad Piers go with his plough
for a cursed starveling.

' Wilt thou or wilt thou not,
we will have our will

" Of thy flour and of thy flesh,
will take it when we please,

" Ay and make merry with it
for all thy grudging.'*

Then PIERS PLOWMAN
complained him to the knight,

To keep him as
his covenant

was
from the wolfish wastrels:

J

1 Avenge me of these wastrels
that make the world so dear,

"There
be no
plenty
in the

and the plough lieth still."

Courteously the knight,
as his manner was,

Warned wastrels all
and bad them do better:

" Or thou shalt dear aby it,
by my knightly order,

" I shall beat thee by the law
and bring thee to the stocks."
" I was
not wont
to
work,"

says Wastrel,
" and I will not begin."
Made light of the law,
set less by the knight,

Piers was worth a peascod,
he and his plough,
And threatened Piers and
his

men
when next they met*

" By my souls peril,"
says PIERS PLOWMAN,

' I will repay you all
for your proud words,"
And shouted after Hunger,
(Hunger heard him soon)
" Take
vengeance
on
these

wastrels

Hunger came in haste,
took Wastrel by the mouth
Wrung him by the womb,
brought water to his eyes.

He buffeted the Breton man
about both his cheeks,
That he looked like a lantern
all his life after.
He beat both the boys,

They are not like the lollers

Slyly lurking
Hoping to sit at eventide

Uncross their legs

Resting them, roasting them,

Drinking to the last drop,
And when they will and please,
And, when they rise, roam out,
Where they may get a break-

fast,

Silver or sod meat
A loaf, half a loaf,
And home they carry it
And live in idleness
Every fellow of their flock
Bag at his back,
And yet knows some kind
of

craft,

Could get him bread and ale
And yet lives like a loller

they hide no bottles,
and the hermits false,

to catch mens alms,
by the house fire,
and lie at their ease,

turning round to the fire,

slowly turning to bed,

in morning to arise,
and easily espy

first a round of bacon,
and sometimes both,

a lump of cheese,

Here endeth Williams Vision of Piers Plowman.

(A brief abstract follows of the books not fully transcribed.)

THE
VISIONS OF DO-WELL,

DO-BETTER AND DO-BEST

THE
VISIONS
OF DO-WELL,

DO-BETTER AND DO-BEST

DO-WELL

Thus robed in russet

All a summer season
And oft I asked
Where Do-well was
Never wight as I went

Till on a Friday
For they be men
Through countries, courts,

Princes palaces,
And know Do-well—and Do-evil.

I roamed about,

Do-well to seek,

the folk I met
and what man he might be.

could tell me where,
two Friars I saw;

that walk most widely
and many kinds of places,
and poor mens cots,

' Among us," quoth they,

1 And ever hath been

" that man is dwelling
and ever shall be."

1 Nay," said I, " man sins
seven times a day,

1 Therefore he
is not alway
among you Friars,

' He is elsewhere now and then and teacheth the people."

1 My son," said the Friar,

1 How the good man sinneth

' Set a man in a boat

1 The wind and the water

' Make
him
stumble,
if
he

stand

1 Through steering the boat

1 Yet is he safe and sound

" I shall soon show thee

seven times a day.

on a broad water;
and boat wagging

never so stiffly;

he bendeth and boweth,

so is it with the righteous

;

I 36
Piers Plowman

Though he fall he falleth not,
And he is safe and sound*
Thus is it with men;
Goods are the great waves,
The boat is our body;
And thro the
fiend and the

flesh

The just man sinneth

But deadly sin he doth not,
He
strengtheneth
man
to

stand

And though thy body bow
Yet is thy soul safe."

—he is in the boat

the water is the world,

wallowing about,

and the frail world

seven times a day.

Do-well him guardeth,

and steereth his soul,

as boat doth in the water,

Nay I cannot understand
all your wise words,

But
if I live and look about

me
I shall go learn better."

Christ keep thee," quoth he;
and I said, " Christ keep you

And give you grace
good men to be."

Thus I went wide-where,

In a wide wilderness,

Bliss of the birds song
And on a lawn under a linden
To listen to their lays,
The mirth of their mouths
And mid that bliss

walking alone,
by a wood side.
made me abide there,

I leaned awhile

their lovely notes

;

made me to sleep,

I dreamed—marvellously.

Thought came and gave me over to Wit to tell me where

dwelt Do-well.
And Wit told me, " In a castle near, watched

by Sense, and the
Castles name
is
Flesh; "
and Wit
spoke

much to me on the foolishness
of man.
But Wits wife came,

named Study, lean
of body, and wondrous wroth with him.

Quoth she,
" Wise art thou, Wit,
wisdom to tell

" To fools or flatterers
or frantic folk."

She blamed him,
she banned

him,

" Cast not your pearls to hogs;
" Wisdom and Wit now
" Save

" Whoso can contrive deceit,
" Lead a merry meeting
" His counsel is called for."

she bad him be still,

they have their haws,

are not worth a
cress

as clothiers comb their wool;

conspire to wrong,
and Truth beguile,

It was so in Jobs
time, it
is so
to-day, said
she.
They that

preach the truth are
little
cared
for.
You
find men arguing

of
Christ, arguing
of the
Trinity,
drivelling about the Deity

when their belly is full.

' But the careful cry

' Hungry, thirsty,

' None calls him nearer

' They
shoo

off
as

1 God is not in that house

and call at their gates,

chilly quaking,

his woes to amend,

and bid him go,

nor His help neither.

' The learned talk of God,
and His name is on their lips

' But the poor have Him in their heart.

' God is deaf now-a-days

1 And prayers have no power

' Yet
the
wretches
of
this

world

1 Nor for dread of death

' Nor share their plenty with the poor;

' But in gaiety, in gluttony
they
glut
themselves
with

wealth,

1 And the more they win,
wealth and riches,

' And lord it over lands
the less they part with.

Thus Study railed at her husband and at me.

Then
I
thanked
her
and
went on my way
to
Learning

(Clergy) and got his words.
He told me Do-well was to believe

the articles of the faith; but his talk was long.

" This is a long lesson/' quoth I,
" and little am I the wiser,

But, I said, I find the unexpected in heaven and the builders

of holy church in danger of being
lost, as were the carpenters

of Noahs ark who never got inside.

" On Good Friday I find

Then Scripture scorned me
and gave reasons,

And blamed me—in Latin
and set light by me,

And I wept for woe
and wrath at her speech

And in a winking I was brought away.

I met then with Fortune and, with her, two damsels, Lust of

the Eyes and Lust of the Flesh and Recklessness, who praised

poverty to me;

" Although it be sore to suffer
there cometh sweet after,

" As without a walnut
is a bitter bark,

" And after that,
the shell being gone,

" Is a kernel of comfort;
so is it with poverty.

" It maketh man have mind

on God
and his mercy crave,

" And safer he sleepeth,
the man that is poor,

" And dreadeth death less,
or the thief in the dark,

" Than the right rich man

" Lo, lo, lords, lo,
and ladies, take heed,

" Not so long doth it last,

" As peascods and pears,
as cherries and plums,

" Worldly wealth
is a wicked

thing
to them that keep it."

He went on to speak to me of Abraham and Job—both poor

men once;
and told me of the merchant and the messenger.

No one stayeth the messenger upon his message (even though

he go through the standing corn), for it is urgent and he
is but

poor;
but the merchant is stayed and pays money on his goods

and is in fear of robbery to boot;

" Ye wit well, ye wise,
what this meaneth,

" The merchants are the rich,
to Christ accountable,

Then after Recklessness had spoken, Nature came near and

complained that all animals excepting man follow Reason, and

I saw it was so

;

I bowed my body,
Saw sun and sea,
Where birds and beasts
Wild serpents in the woods

beholding all about me,
and the sand of the shore,

with their mates wandered,
and wonderful birds,

Flecked with many a coloured feather;
Man and his mate,

Poverty and plenty,
And I saw all beasts

In eating and drinking
Man and his mate

Birds I beheld

I wondered from whom
To lay the sticks
Hiding and covering

In marshes on moors

Divers dived.

Peace and War,

bliss and bitter bale;

following Reason,
and gendering their kind;

alone were Reason-less,
making nests in the bushes,
and where the pie learnt

that lie in her nest,

that no fool should find;

in mire and in water
" Dear God," said
I,

" Where gat these wild things wit? "

But that which most moved me
changing my mood,

Was that I saw all beasts
Save man and mankind;
" Wherefore," said I,
" Dost thou not rule
" None surfeit as he does
" In meat and in drink,

following Reason,

" so widely thou reignest
man and his mate?
and keep not measure,

in dress and in women,

' They overdo it day and night and only they—none other."
But Reason reasoned me;
" Reck thou never

" Why I suffer or surfer not.
" Who
suffereth
more
than

God?"
" No man, by my life,

142
Piers Plowman

" He might amend in a minute
all that
is amiss,

" But He suffereth to show us
that we should all suffer."

Then I saw one near me called Imagination.
He rebuked me

for my ignorance and for my presumption in that I thought I
knew how God
ruled the world
of man and
bird and beast.

Nature understandeth more than man.
Man knoweth
little;

no, he knoweth not why Adam
ate the
apple, nor why the

homely
lark
is
sweeter than
the
rich
peacock,
nor whether

Saracens
shall come
to
heaven, where
the pagan Trajan
is.

" Had st thou
held thy tongue,"
said
he,
" thou
hadst been

wise."

And therewith I awaked
And forth gan walk
And my dreams I pondered.
Fortune had failed me
Age had threatened me

Friars had shown me
And no corpse in their kirkyard

If he had not bequeathed them
And Nature had told me
And Imagination had spoken and vanished

And I lay down and slept again.

Then came Conscience to comfort me,

drank

" Do thy neighbour no harm,

" By this day, Sir Doctor,

" I would change my penance with yours."

Piers Plowman

" serving in a castle,

As we went on talking we met a minstrel and we asked him

of
spots;
a spot of pride, a spot of rough
speech, of
scorn, of

careless bearing, boasting and bragging; he belonged to an order

of hermits and he the only person in the order;
he was religious

without rule and blamed all men.
" By Christ, Hankyn," said

Conscience, " thy coat must be washed."
" Ay," said he, "
it

has many stains."

And Hankyn asked and Patience told him of Poverty and of

Riches, and
of the
nine
blessings
of Poverty;
and Poverty

avoideth the Seven Deadly
Sins.
" It
is," said Patience, " a

hateful blessing, it judges none (for it is too poor to be made a

judge);
it
is wealth without calumny;
it
is the gift of God;
it
is

mother of health;
it is a road of peace;
it is a well of wisdom;

it is business without loss; and it is happiness without care."

When Hankyn heard this he wept and wailed and with that

I waked.

Till the day dawned

And men rang in the resurrection morning.

and called to Kitty my wife

And to Kalot my daughter and said:

" Arise, do reverence

" Creep on your knees to the

cross
and kiss it for a jewel,

" And the most righteous relic,
none richer on the earth,

" For for our redemption

" And so great is its power

(An abstract of the concluding books follows.)

DO-BEST

Thus I waked and wrote
all I had dreamed,

And dight me ready
and went me to church.

To hear the mass
and be housled after.

In midst of the mass
when men went to offerings

I fell soon asleep
and suddenly—a dream,

That
PIERS THE
PLOW-

MAN
was painted all bloody

And came in with a cross
before the common people,

Like in all his limbs
to our Lord Jesu,

And then I called Conscience
to tell me the truth;

" Is this Jesus the Jouster
that the Jews did to death,

" Or is it PIERS PLOWMAN

;

who painted him so red? "

And Conscience kneeled,
" These be Piers arms,

" His colours, his coat-armour,
but He that cometh so bloody

" It is Christ with his Cross
conqueror of Christendom."

Then Conscience told me of Christs resurrection and how He

gave his power to PIERS PLOWMAN, and anon departed into
heaven and sent the Holy Ghost to Piers and to his fellows and
gave them many
gifts, the four gospels and the four fathers,

Austin, Ambrose, Gregory and Jerome, and four seeds j and Piers
sowed them all, cardinal virtues, Prudence and Temperance and

Justice and Bravery.

Then came
Pride
and
gathered
his
host
together
against

Piers and against Grace and against Conscience and
all Chris-

tians, and sent out Spill-love mounted on his horse Speak-ill-

behind.
And Piers and his people gathered to Fort Unity and

dug a trench about
it, and Conscience called Piers army to the

sacrament.

,: Come," cries Conscience,
" Christians and dine

" Yea, baw," cries a brewer,
" I will not be ruled

" By fear, for all your jangling

" Nor follow Conscience

" Dregs and draff

" I am a curate of the church,"
cries a fool vicar,

" Never man told me

" I never knew Cardinal

" And we parsons pay for them,

The vicars home was far off
and he bowed and took leave

And I awaked
and wrote my dream.

Then for the last time I went upon my way and I met Need.

He reviled me for meekly listening when the lord and the king

170
Piers Plowman

had spoken so boldly.
" Couldst thou not excuse thyself? " says

he.
"The
king
steals,
the
lord
steals;
and
thy
need,
thy

necessity may well steal too.
Need hath no Law."

He sinneth not
And if he seeth a cloth
Need anon taketh it
And
if he list to drink

He should drink at any ditch

So Need at greed need
Without counsel of Conscience
Save the spirit of temperance.
Wise men forsook wealth
And dwelt in deserts
And God all his great joy
And came and took mankind

in him

Both fox and fowl

Fishes have fins
Need hath taken hold on me
And suffer sorrows sour.
Be not abashed

Since He that wrought all the

world

Never a one so needy

Then shall the Lord love thee and God

Himself shall be thy great reward.
Attributed to King Alfred.

Every
literature
has
its
dreamers.
It
is
so
simple
to
sit

down,
fall
asleep, and then
assail your enemies and support

yourself by dreaming your opinions.
If any objection be taken,

well,
it was a dream.
Plato dreamed his beautiful myths;
the

wonderful relation of Er at the close of the Republic was but
the dream
of one who had been dead;
the moody tinker of

Bedford dreamed the Pilgrims Progress ; Roman literature has

its Somnium Scipionis ;
Chaucer dreamed Scipios dream again

in the Parlement of Foules;
Dantes vision was but a vision

when sleep came on him in the wood;
the whole of the Faerie

Queene may be said to be a dream.
The dream
is as common

to poet and prose writer as is the invisible cap or the impossible
task to the folk and fairy lorist.

It must be admitted at the outset that some dreams—what-

ever the machinery may be for their production—are artistic,

finished,
jointed,
logical.
We
recall
them
in
the
morning;

beyond their incongruity, their horror or their fun, we can find
no fault with them.
Indeed we are amazed at their cleverness.

All
is
in order;
every incident proceeds from what has gone

before;
they are admirably prepared;
and good dreamers will

certainly support and believe R. L. Stevensons statement that
the dreaming brain can make excellent plots.
The well-known

essay on Dreams gives, apparently in good faith, an illustration

of this, and Stevensons dream-plot, if unmarketable, is, at least,
most striking.

But other dreams, literary or no, are as confused as the welter

of waves on a rocky shore.
You make out the general movements

but no more.
New waves are continually breaking from
all

sides; and
it is to this order of dream that the vision of Pier,

Plowman belongs.
As I said in the Preface, the general scheme

is
clear; but the detailed pictures are
inconsistent, detached,

and in some instances apparently useless for the main purpose.

1 82
Piers Plowman

The writer
is always falling asleep;
half-way through the book

he is dead and buried ;
the vision finishes and begins again;
the

end
is no end;
the Plowman himself is an elusive dream-figure

with many shades
of meaning in him;
apparently, though
it

was twice revised, the work had no final revision.
It
is of a

piece with its chaotic century.
We should not be surprised to

find that the book was based on a dream.

But the confusion of the dream
is nothing to the confusion

of the
allegory.
Even the sexes
of the various
figures seem

indeterminate;
and Wit, Wisdom, Clergy, Scripture, Imagina-

tion, the Active Man,
Peace, Mercy, Reason, Righteousness,

Repentance, must not be driven hard towards consistency.
It

will be well for the reader,
if he wishes to get a clear picture of

the dream, not to
insist upon
its
details.
That such a clear

picture may be obtained I hope I have shown in my Preface;
but few allegories may be pushed roughly to their conclusions.
Even Professor Saintsbury, that eulogist of the Faerie Queene,

is
constrained
to admit that you may
if you
like leave the

allegory alone;
it " won't hurt you."

The book definitely promises a picture of England between

1350 and 1400.
The dates of course are not given, but these

are supplied by the evidence of its contents.
We are to see the

Field
full of Folk.
We are not going to look on any Dutch

interiors, or mere portraiture of a few saints and a few sinners;

there are to be no " nine and twenty in a company of sundry

folk by aventure
ifalle; " something wider, bigger
is promised

us, nothing short of a birds-eye view of the English world with
London
for
its
centre, while the dreamers body
lies on the

Malvern Hills, and over him sing the birds of early summer, and
the brook runs babbling by and mingles its sound with the noise

of a great multitude.
You shall see the Pope, titular head of

Christendom, finding
it hard as the King does to guide men as

he would;
cardinals against whose election you and I may not

speak, for we are no Lollards, not we;
bishops running freely

through all sorts of offices and doing all kinds of work as William

of Wykeham and Bishop Spencer of Norwich did;
unable, for

all their cleverness, to rule their dioceses and to keep the robber
pardoner and the meddling
friar away;

the seven " minor orders " of the Church;

you shall see the hard-working parish priest, passably

ignorant, miserably poor and made poorer by his mortal enemy
the friar; the friars, all the four orders, Franciscans, Dominicans,
Carmelites and Austins, pledged to poverty and pursuing wealth;
the chantry priest and the gild priest each bent on making an
income and
filling a soft place;
and with them the good and

bad accompaniments
of a great Church,
hermits,
anchorites,

pilgrims and palmers.
But there are more to be seen than these

;

and in the great plain are
officials of every kind,
sheriffs and

bedels, assizers and jurymen, whose business
it seems to be to

prey upon humanity.
Turn your eyes in another direction and

Edward
III.
is
slowly dying (alas
for
the Black Prince who

might have done so much—he
is gone) and Lady Meed
is strip-

ping off his ring;
the kitten Richard II., so helpless at first, so

foolish afterwards,
is in the hands of Parliament or nobles; the

nobles
are
quarrelling, the Commons are curbing them;
dis-

order,
disorganisation and attempted
reform can
all be seen

from Malvern
Hills.
As for the lawyers, you shall see enough

of them,
all dressed in furs,
all pleading for pence, all open to

bribery, and
juries and witnesses, judges and pleaders are on

the look-out for florins.
Then the merchants pass by and the

moneylenders, the big and little traders, till we come to the very
dregs and
find ourselves
face to
face with the Seven Deadly

Sins of London.
London itself and its narrow ways, its bridges,

its palaces,
its convents,
its hovels,
its brothels, you
shall see

them all and almost catch the conversations as the people pass
by us.
You can be present at the great Stourbridge fair and

there see Venetian glass, Bruges linen, Spanish iron, Norwegian

tar, Hanse fur, Cornish tin and Cretan wine, all for sale in the

half of a square mile which was occupied for three whole weeks.
Then you shall come forth into the country and watch the misery

of the country poor, hear of their work, their food, their dress;
and so along the roads past the crowds of beggars and wastrels,

till perhaps you shall get a dinner in some great mans house and
take part, from a side-bench,
in a discussion
of some useless

point of theology.
Nothing shall escape you by the way, the

burial-places of the Great Pestilence, the stocks, the pillory, the
cucking-stool, the alehouse, the hospital, the prison, the recluse

in
his
cell,
the
doctor murdering
his
patients,
the
minstrel

telling
his love
stories, the juggler and the monkey-man, the

farmer and his stots, the poor priest preaching, the lunatic loller
prophesying, and the train of Lady Meed.
Nay, you may,
if

1 84
Piers Plowman

you be fortunate, see Piers himself, sowing his seed and preach-
ing to the pilgrims of Truth, and may dream of him, as Jesus,
leaving the world with Piers Plowmans fruit—poor humanity

in his arms, the only Saviour of the world.
This world-wide

"landscape with figures "
is the promise of William Langland

a promise more than fulfilled, for not half the scenes have been
enumerated, not a quarter
of the
characters named.
Could

any one to-day, in Langlands
social position, dream, promise

and perform so great an undertaking as this ?

We take the story from the writers standpoint.
It
is not,

as some histories tell us, that the kings wars were unimportant;
but they were to the writer and to the people whom he repre-

sents the least important of his visions.
No one in editing a

peoples book to-day should begin with discussing the European

position, or the change of an Indian capital;
but the price of

sugar, the picture palace, the emptiness
of churches, the
six-

penny doctor, the
schools, the football
field, the public-house

and the
district nurse would
attract the Langland
of to-day

first.
By the Langland of to-day I mean Mr. Masterman, Miss

Loane,
Mr.
Lysons,
Mr.
Pett Ridge,
Mr.
H.
G.
Wells,
Mr.

Harold Begbie and Mr. Stephen Reynolds.
I begin then with

the book picture of the writer himself, always premising that in

this work the writer set himself an enormous task, that his view
may be one-sided and extreme, and that, even in his self-revela-

tions, we may be on ground as treacherous as when we try to
recover Charles Lamb from the hints of Elia.

" Long Will," as he calls himself, in one memorable line, was

set to school in early days and learned to love the school and

cloister;
for one who afterwards was so severe a critic of this

world, he speaks kindly of these early days.
It may have been

at Malvern ; and he may have gained then his vague and rather

intellectual love of the country and
its sights.
But in this he

never approached Chaucer, who
is
filled through and through

with the outdoor Englishmans appreciation of field and forest
and stream;
for Langland was as much a town man as Dr.

Johnson.

His learning
is remarkable.
The Bible
is,
if roughly quoted,

at his fingers ends;
but he never uses the Wycliffite version,

though
it must have been accessible in some form before the

last
recension
of the manuscript.
In
this however he
is not

singular;
for Wyclif never quotes from what
is called
his own

translation.
The usual reading of the Fathers supplies Langland

Comment
185

with a few
texts and a few
illustrations;
Gregory, Jerome,

Austin and of course Cato are among the writers he has heard
most of;
indeed to the medievalist Cato may be regarded as

a Church Father.
The apocryphal gospel of Nicodemus may

have helped him
in that tremendous
section
of
his poem
in

which
Piers Plowmans
fruit,
i.e. humanity,
is brought from

Hell;
but
it
is unsafe to dogmatise, for so much was known by

being heard and repeated
orally that before Caxtons time a

man might possess a very liberal education and yet have never
seen a book at all;
so much did the writer of that day rely upon

his memory.
A few French
sentences prove
little;
Chaucer

himself, who must have
spoken French
well, avoids French

speech more than Shakespeare does;
and there
is no hint of

Langlands knowing any Greek.
It
is interesting to think he

may have read Chaucers Prologue;
let us hope, for the sake of

his own peace of mind, that he did not;
for he would, I fear,

have reckoned Chaucer among the minstrels.

He must have drifted to London for he knows
it well:
he

certainly
represents
himself
as
preferring
the
easy
life
of
a

chantry priest to that of a hard-working man.
Cornhill and

S. Pauls are the most respectable parts of London mentioned
by him;
but the poorer or disreputable parts mentioned, such

as Cocks Lane, Shoreditch, with their stews and their quacks,
are many, and their characters are drawn to the
life.
He says

he was married and had a daughter;
but he
is careful to give

wife and daughter equivocal names, which he need not have
done.
He convicts himself of lax practice in regard to honesty

in work.
He
is extremely careful to point out that whatever

may be thought of his opinions in the poem, he
is not a loller;

indeed, he made verses on the lollers when he lived in Cornhill.
He was always poor, always welcome, always
critical;
but in

London
his
opinions developed and he became one with the

mass which new ideas were slowly moving.
He found himself

the apostle of the poor, the honest quiet poor, whom he came
to love passionately.
Their poverty, grinding and unceasing,

he ascribed to want of philanthropy, robbery, jobbery and bad
government.
He never ascribed
it to simony at Avignon—the

sinful city—nor to the French wars, as he might have done had
he been writing to-day of his own work;
nor, of course, did he

understand that there may be a dozen causes for misery, some
of the causes being directly attributable to the miserable them-

selves.
He is not in the least ashamed of begging for the poor

1 86
Piers Plowman

or for himself; and indeed the magnificent philanthropy of the
medieval Church in its best days had encouraged begging, and
perhaps produced the poverty
it
strove
to
alleviate.
In
all

centuries (at any rate in England) the condition of the poor has
been watched over and alleviated by the rich and the moderately

rich in a way that shows, gainsay it who may, that the teaching

of Christ in regard to individual responsibility has up to now
permeated the country;
and though poverty may have over-

taken
benevolence, and though benevolence
itself may be a

mistake and philanthropy a crime, no friend of the poor would
care to imagine an England denuded instantly of
all that has

been given and
is being
freely and gladly given to the poor

from
definitely
religious and Christian
sources.
This
is more

true
even
of
pre-Reformation
than
of
post - Reformation

England, for in Langlands day the state assumed no responsi-

bility.
It must be remembered that he wrote a quarter of a

century
after the Black Death and England had not
in any

sense recovered;
and
it must be further remembered that in

his day the
alleged enmities
of
class and
class,
sex and
sex,

capital and labour, had not been
felt.
The rich and the poor,

notwithstanding the Peasants Revolt, were nearer one another
than they are to-day.
The enmities in Langlands day were those

of king and nobles, nobles and the middle
class;
neither the

king nor the rich merchant was in theory or practice unfriendly

to the people.

Yet, whether he understood the problems or no, his book
is

more valuable than any contemporary writing:
for he wrote

from the inside.
He tells us what the poor wanted;
and only

lately, notwithstanding the fact that his book and his teaching-
have been accessible for five hundred years, has this lesson been

learnt.
It is a new discovery to us, that the poor have opinions

regarding their betterment.
It comes almost as a shock to us

to read in his pages that his poor required lower rents, better
and less adulterated food, warm clothes, and above all the kindly
sympathy of people who lived among them and tried to under-

stand them.
We can almost hear him saying to us:
" Give us

these first, and then, if you like, you can go on to model villages
and
sterilised
milk."
I
respectfully wonder
if
Mr.
Stephen

Reynolds and Miss M. Loane, who write with knowledge of our

poor, have carefully looked through Piers Plowman;
if they

have they must have been startled.

Besides loving the poor and hating the wastrel, Langland loved

Comment
187

the Church and hated
its household enemies.
It
is true that

(considering his century) a minimum
of dogma
satisfied him:

but with this he combined a maximum of Christ.
The Pope,

as such,
is a legitimate ruler; he seems to know nothing of the

rottenness of Rome and Avignon;
even the Church machinery

was good ;
but it was worked
ill.
We who live in a time when

the clergy (I use the word of the ministers of all denominations)
work hard,
are not
over-dressed, do not carry forbidden
re-

volvers, do not rob the poor, do not pay money out of the
country, do not plead
in papal
courts,
are not absentees
or

pluralists, and certainly are not rich, can hardly understand that
a man of Langlands sympathies should have been, as he certainly
was, so strong a defender of the fourteenth-century Church.
In

it he sees the only bulwark against Antichrist;
and he cannot

even see this bulwark raised unless the
friars and monks and

parish priests and bishops come with Piers Plowman into the

Castle of Unity.

And
if he loves the Church, he
is at least respectful to the

king.
Beyond a sharp word now and again to Edward III. and

a remonstrance to Richard
II., Langland
is a kings man;
it

seems to me that he even has some insight into the difficulties
of both sovereigns when he writes that pathetic line

:

" But
it is hard," quoth the king, " to guide my people to honesty."

Even the great and
rich he does not attack indiscriminately;

and he certainly believed in those class distinctions which every

society and
every
section
of
society makes, though
it
hides

them as decently as it can and professes to abhor them.

But
lawyers,
theologians,
most
minstrels,
physicians
and

unemployables he cannot away with;
and here we see for the

first time the narrowness of one who did not understand law
or theology, and who could not fiddle or cure the
sick.
For

there must have been, and indeed he allows
it, many lawyers

who were not bribable, many theologians who knew what they
were talking about, some decent-mouthed minstrels and a few
satisfactory doctors ; but his lines about the unemployable might
have been written in 191 2.

Here then is the man ; a reformer of Church and State and a

defender of the poor;
failing perhaps from the very immensity

of his canvas to paint all his pictures equally well, yet contriving
even in his bitterest moments to follow his own advice to the
king, " Hear the other side."
Again and again he pleads against

1 88
Piers Plowman

his own writing, and you may seek in vain through all the book

for one word of self-praise.

His humour
is not Chaucers;
his
coarse passages may be

numbered on the ringers of one hand, and they are then very

brief and blunt;
while Chaucer,
like Shakespeare and
all the

Elizabethans, is crammed with passages which Langland would
never have tolerated.
He
is too much in earnest to waste his

time
in
loose
talk;
though,
if he had wished
to do
so, the

sardonic writer
of the Seven Deadly Sins could have put to

shame Skelton, Dryden and Wycherley
in
their own peculiar

mistles.
Fun there
is, satire there
is, in abundance;
but there

is no filth, nor, alas, except in one passage, are there any tears.
He
is dry-eyed, staring at Antichrist.
England
is hurrying to

the precipice and Piers Plowman is gone.

His choice of metre,
if metre
it can be called, was no doubt

intentional;
he meant to get to the ears of the people and this

he could only do by alliteration or by ballad.
The Chaucerian

line would have stamped him as a dilettante in social reform.
The result
is that the book
is not a poem;
no juggling
will

reduce it to rules; no whitewashing will make it all interesting;
but it stands crammed with living pictures and full of a terrible

anger.
Whether he did gain the peoples ear
is very doubtful;

the one quotation in the trumpet-calls of the 1381 revolt is not
at
all
conclusive;
apart
from
ballad,
song
and
folk-tale,

literature
has
never
been
thoroughly
assimilated
by
the

English people;
the people have no time to read.
The Bible

alone and a certain amount of economic prophecy have sunk
deep.

I cannot understand why his book has never been seized on

by artists and
illustrators;
and I venture to
call the readers

attention particularly to the following descriptions which are

full of the power of a poet who carelessly let the poetry go
the ride to Westminster, the Vision of the Sins, the description

of Piers
service to Truth, the description
of the cottager, the

character of Charity, and the descent into Hell.

This then was the man and this the book which set out to

describe fourteenth-century England:
for whom was the book

intended and why was
it written?
what were the real pictures

as we have
them
from
other
sources?
is
Piers
Plowmans

indictment true?

Langland was born into a world the great fact of which was

the
Church.
It
was
everywhere.
It
possessed
nearly,
not

Comment
189

quite,
all the learning of his day;
it
filled
offices which have

long since been handed to the laity.
Its courts controlled Church

affairs and
a good
deal more than
Church
affairs—personal

morality (save the mark) came largely under
its lash and
its

fine.
It was wealthy, national, proud at heart;
as the Good

Parliament showed,
it hated Roman
aggression;
but
it was

waiting
for a chance
of
burning
heretics—which soon came.

Its buildings filled the streets of London and Oxford ; the parish
church, the
cathedral church, the
friars
convent, the monks

abbey, the chantry, the
anchorites
cell,
the mesondieux, and

even the schools, all were—the Church.
It was as impossible

for a reformer to write a poem and not to fill it with the Church

as
it would seem absurd
for a modern reformer to regard the

Church
as the
centre
of
all.
It
is the custom to
deride the

fourteenth-century Church.
Langland and Wyclif, so different

in other matters, denounce the wholesale simony, the traffic in
pardons, the whole institution of the friars, the power of foreign

priests, the misused wealth
of
the Church and
the misspent

time of her
sons;
and Chaucer, who could not
rise to these

heights of indignation, never loses a chance of satire.
Even the

modern Catholic historian Lingard cannot point to the
four-

teenth
century with
satisfaction;
and
the French
Jusserand

admits
fully the charges of the poets.
It
is well therefore to

realise that if there is no other side to the question, in two respects
at least the Church of the fourteenth century has had scanty

justice done to
it.
And first of all,
it was not blind to its own

defects.
The abuses noted in Chaucer and Langland are con-

demned strongly in a papal
letter of the time.
In 1340 the

Bishop
of Durham,
in
1378 the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury,

pleaded
for reform.
" Nothing can give a better idea
of the

wickedness
of Pardoners than the actual
letters of Popes and

Bishops "
(Jusserand).
Again, the Church was democratic in

this, that by it and by it alone the poor mans son saw and took

his chance.
A long list of archbishops and bishops might easily

be written out,
all of whom came from the homes of the poor.

It was no uncommon
thing
for a
promising
serf
to
receive

freedom and to be trained in the service of Church and State;
and
it is precisely this carelessness as regards the birth or even

the legitimacy of its clergy that draws down Langlands strong

criticism:
for Langland, apostle of the poor, believed in gentle

birth.
The knightly Chaucer, who had been about the world

and
fought,
thinks nothing
of
the
fact that
his parson, the

190
Piers Plowman

gentlest, sweetest saint in all his writings, was own brother to
a ploughman who had " ilad of donge ful many a fother," but
Langland wishes that the Church would keep the poor in their

places.
The following paragraph quoted
freely
is worth con-

sideration:
" The most striking feature of the centuries to the

sixteenth is the way in which the Church opened up a career to

all ranks and classes of the people.
There was of course always

a strong aristocratical element among the clergy
.
.
. the middle

classes supplied a great number of parish chaplains, assistant

curates, chantry priests, gild priests ; young men born and bred

as serfs were not infrequently educated and ordained.
Among

archbishops only, Richard came from humble parents;
E. Rich

was son of a merchant, R. Kilwardby was a Dominican friar;
W. Reynolds was son of a baker;
Chichele was a shepherd boy

picked up and educated by William of Wykeham;
Cranmers

people were small squires;
R. Flambard, the great justiciar of

Henry
I., was the son of a poor Norman
priest;
Richard
of

Wych, the saintly bishop of Winchester, was son of a decayed
farmer at Droitwich, and for several years worked as a labourer;
the famous Grosseteste was of a poor family at Stradbrooke in

Suffolk " (Cutts, Parish Priests, 133).
Sir Robert Sale, who died

so heroically in 138 1, fighting against the insurgents, was himself
a serf who had risen to knighthood, and was captain-general of
Norwich.
Only through the theory and practice of the medieval

Church did poor mens sons become lawyers, architects, sheriffs,

scribes, physicians and teachers.

Chaucer understands the theory
of the Church
Catholic, a

theory which has never changed, that
all men
before
it
are

equal.
In this Eastern and Western religions are alike.
The

practice
of the Church
has
indeed
varied;
but
the
curious

anomaly may be noted that the world has invariably taken a
view which is at variance with that of the Church.
The worlds

practice is to treat men as equal, as far as it can, and not to hurt

their feelings;
that they are equal in any sense
it never
will

believe.

In another matter the medieval Church demands the respect

of
its modern
critic.
It aided education;
indeed,
it was the

only educator, and, directly by
its teaching,
indirectly by
its

encouragement of benevolence,
it founded places of education

which flourished
till the Reformation.
Writers as
diverse
as

Mr. A. F. Leach, Mr. Bass Mullinger, Professor Thorold Rogers,

relying on statutes, sermons, charters, and quoting freely from

Comment
1 9

contemporary authors, come to the same conclusion, that the
pre-Reformation Church was the friend, not the enemy, of the
education
of
the
poor;
for
the
rich man
either
derided
all

education or had his own peculiar way of obtaining it.
If Church

advice had been followed, the battle of and for modem education,

especially primary education, would have been infinitely easier

to fight.
Richard
II. rejected a proposal to forbid villeins to

send
their
children
to
school
to
learn
clergee
(knowledge):

" Every man or woman, of what state or condition he be, shall
be free to set their son or daughter to take learning at any school

that pleaseth them within the realm."

The Church then,
full of mistakes, crammed with internecine

and often unpatriotic quarrels, but still in theory, and to a great

extent
in
practice, the
poor mans
Church,
filled the picture.

Its spiritual pretensions were high—its ecclesiastical pretensions
were enormous—but its social pretensions were not those of some

of the later centuries.
The world will always yield (or has
till

now always yielded) to
spiritual pretensions when adequately

supported by the consistent
life.
It
clings even now to
the

legend
of
S.
Francis, whose
spiritual
pretensions, under
the

guise of humility, were an unconscious travesty of those of his
master;
even ecclesiastical pretensions
it will listen to, though

with a smile, when based on what it loves—sympathy, charity,
humanity;
but the
social pretension which grew from wealth

and from an ill-defined class feeling, it cannot reconcile with the
teaching
of the poor parson of the Canterbury
Tales.
Classes

there must always be; man
is not happy without them, and

they exist in every station of society ; but society knows at heart
that they should be decently covered, and the truest mark of a
"gentleman"
is to hide his " gentlemanliness."
Castes there

must always be;
Piers Plowman himself belonged to the very

highest, whether we look at him
in
his mittens or as
riding

to the gates of Hell;
and of all the characters in the poem his

spiritual
pretensions
are the
greatest.
Yet, by virtue
of
his

freedom from social pretensions, he
is intensely democratic.

The Church of any country, any century, can hope to recover

lost ground among what are called the masses, not by a whittling
down of dogma, nor by a renunciation of claims to denounce
the sins of society—for the human society is the Church—but by
a frank abjuration of all social and economic pretensions.
The

history of the
friars, as well as that of the
Salvation Army,

point alike to the right road and to the parting of the ways.

192
Piers Plowman

The parish church was the special property of the people who

lived round it.
When small, it still had some gild window, some

long-remembered
connection
with
the
great
or
small
village

names.
It rose, as it often rises to-day, the only building of the

human souls ambition, above the meaner roofs ;
it was the centre

of village life and the meeting-place of the dead.
When large,

it served for examination room, playhouse, even dancing floor;

it was open every day and all day;
it had its daily services.
It

was the rallying-point of the English villages.
Parsons might be

and were absentees;
it might be served by the unworthy;
but

it and its services were there.
Langland points clearly to abuses.

Once a fortnight perhaps some interfering
friar of one of the

four orders (Cain they were pleasantly nicknamed by Wyclif)
would come preaching in the churchyard;
and sometimes the

pardoner or limiter would invade even the church
itself, when

the priest was not strong enough to prevent
it.
It
is difficult

to escape the conclusion that a most worldly
acquisitiveness

was the secret of the friars activity and of the parsons hatred

of them;
they
laid
their hands on
shrift money and on the

widows mite, and they persuaded the richer people to ask
for

and
to pay
for
letters
of
fraternity.
The
beautiful
descrip-

tion of a
friars church in Piers Plowmans creed might without

change of a word be written of any well-preserved Gothic church;

it must be remembered that all this wealth of stone and carving
and gold was then new, burnished, shining, not toned down to
melancholy beauty by the lapse of centuries.

Friar and parson were, it is probable, unlearned;
the parsons

charged
the
friars
with
interference,
the
friars
charged
the

parsons
with
ignorance
and
neglect
of
their
parishes.
The

terrible picture of Parson Sloth in Langland must of course apply
only to a few, but comic instances
of parsonic ignorance are

many.
"Robert de
Umfraville, clerk, was instituted
in 131

by Bishop Stapledon to the rectory of Lapford, but the bishop

required he should go to grammar school and should come to

the bishop once a year, that the bishop might know what progress
he was making.
The young man
sent
in
his
resignation
in

1320."
Against such a picture may always be quoted the poor

parson
of the
Prologue.
The
friar, however, was the
better

speaker, for it was his metier to speak; and the occasional visitor

gets more credit than the preacher to whom the parish is accus-
tomed.
The friar was ready, polite, pleasant, popular; and his

ways with women were so successful as to become proverbial.

Comment
193

Nothing in Langland said against the friars comes near the bitter

satire of Chaucers laugh; and the praise of the friar by the wife

of Bath would have shamed any one but a friar.

If the parson objected to the friar he must in many cases have

objected to the chantry priest also.
Rarely could a man, a paid

cleric, go on singing masses every day without interfering with

the parish.
It was a lucrative and easy
life.
Sometimes the

church itself was turned into a chantry, sometimes the chantry

priest kept a
little
school.
In
S. Pauls alone there were
70

chantries and in obits (for occasional masses), and in 1378 the
weak Archbishop Sudbury, who was murdered by the 1381 mob,
speaks of the lives of these mass-singers as tending to the detest-

able scandal of churchmen (Besant, 2, 134).
It could not have

been satisfactory for the parson, learned or unlearned, good or

bad, to have so many inspectors and critics of his work about
him.
He
lived
in a
limelight which
darkens
shadows, and

strange to say, he has had no apologist but Chaucer the courtly

poet.
Pity the poor parson in any century who does his multi-

farious work unnoticed by superiors and sometimes unthanked
by his people.

The parson, the
friar, the
seller of pardons, as well as the

higher
ecclesiastics, and
of course
all monks, were vowed
to

celibacy, but
it does not seem that celibacy meant chastity, or

that it prevented, in the case of parsons, the irregular marriages
which the Church frowned on even to the days of Queen Elizabeth.

' The secular cleric," says Cutts, " was not bound to be celibate.
But
if his marriage came up before the ecclesiastical courts
it

was then voidable.
Consequently,
to make
his marriage
in-

capable of legal proof, he had
it performed irregularly in some

particular.
Then it was illegal, derogatory, but not immoral or

disreputable."
In
this
the Church theory conquered
till the

Reformation.
As Matthew Paris said long before, " the Pope

deprived the clergy of sons and the devil sent them nephews"
Langland, however, admits the chastity of many churchmen,
and when Langland speaks well of even part of a class we must
be careful of condemning
it.

This medieval enforcement of chastity
is the heaviest source

of indictment which the modern reformer brings against the
Church.
All miracle-mongering,
sale
of indulgences, robbery,

deceit and the like, are nothing in comparison of the " brutalising
of the race," as Galton calls
it, by the chastity of the sweeter

and
gentler and
more
refined
characters
of
the
time.
The

N

194
Piers Plowman

modern cares little for the self-sacrifice, the agonies of the truly
chaste; that is their own affair.
He boldly accuses the Catholic

Church of being the author of the greatest sin against Western
humanity that has ever been perpetrated.

Of
course the
chastity was
in many
cases but
lip-service.

The contemporary records bear this out.
A certain chaplain,

name not known, had a portifory (breviary) stolen from him at
night by a loose woman because he had not given her any money

either on that night or on the night preceding;
the book was

pledged for Sd. (Riley, 1385).
In 1385, Elisabeth Moring
.
.
.

received girls nominally as apprentices, but really to live a lewd

life and to consort with
friars, chaplains, and other such men

(Besant).
But, though John de Sloghtre, chaplain,
is put
in

the Tower for being found wandering about the city against the
peace, and was also gaoled for carrying arms (Riley, 1320); and
though Richard Herying,
chaplain, was attached
for that he

was indicted in the ward of Farndine (Farringdon)
.
.
. and in

the ward
of Crepelgate
as being a
bruiser and
night-walker

(Riley),
it cannot be
too
carefully remembered
that
records

always call our attention to the worst.
No century would like

to be remembered by the police notes of Bow Street, and no

historian ought to take Langlands pages for the whole of a story.
Chaucer
is much
brighter,
happier;
if
everything had
been

as Langland
paints
it
the century
could not have gone on

existing.

In any comment on Langland
the monks, nuns and
their

convents may be almost
disregarded.
There were no doubt

many who came out of the
cloister and who rode to hounds;

many nuns who deserved the terrible picture drawn by Wrath

(p. 78); but they receive less castigation at the hands of the poets
than does the rest of the ecclesiastical machinery.
Indeed, the

monks seem to be outside the machinery; and the fierce envy

of conventual wealth, which was one of the main causes of the
Reformation, had not yet made
itself greatly
felt.
As for the

reformers of the day, they plainly derided the monks and passed
them by.

But the picture of Church matters is by no means even outlined

in
as
yet.
There
remains
to
be
considered
the
rabble
of

hangers-on,
and
under
this
uncomplimentary term may
be

included foreign agents, pardoners, pilgrims, palmers, hermits,

ancres, recluses of
all kinds, and those
officials who got their

living out of Church moneys, fines, or offerings.
They indeed

form a motley crowd.
Chaucers picture of some (e.g. the Pardoner

and Summoner) is very clear; we see the papal agent, approved

or connived at by the English bishop, selling and showing his
absurd relics to the gaping crowd ; the summoner ready to pounce
on any
defenceless
person and
bring him
or
her
before an

ecclesiastical
court.
For the summoner
there may be some

defence.
For the pardoner it seems there is none.
M. Jusserand,

who would defend him if he could, admits that Chaucers picture

is true;
it
is more damaging to admit that the truly Catholic

Langland is more contemptuous even than Chaucer.
But noth-

ing disturbs the pardoner;
for insolence
of hypocrisy which

recognises
itself there
is nothing to beat his Prologue and his

beautiful tale;
only the scathing Billingsgate of the Host brings

a flush of anger to his cheek.
It
is true that to-day the par-

doner
has
vanished
from
the
streets
of
England;
but
his

audiences have not vanished; and the crowds that buy nostrums
from the magazine advertisements and bottles at street corners,
and the stealthier and richer clients of the crystal-gazer, cannot

afford even to laugh at fourteenth-century England.
The par-

doner has turned quack and gipsy:
that is all.

The foreigner met with less approval than the pardoner.
In

x 353 and
1393 Englishmen were
forbidden
to appeal
to the

papal courts;
Langland sees them appealing against the king.

In
1 35 1
foreigners
were
forbidden
to
hold
English
livings.

Both these statutes aimed at extinguishing what were felt to be
un-English proceedings.

But the pilgrim and the recluse were nearer to the people than

the summoner, the pardoner, or the foreigner.
On every road

the pilgrim, with his
liquified saints blood, his vernicle picture,

and
his
scallop-shell,
told
of
his
escapes,
his
travels and
his

relics.
He was a genuine person—when he had travelled;
he

had been, as the wife of Bath had, over many a strange stream,
and
if he liked had leave to lie all his life after.
Langlands and

Chaucers pictures are so familiar that we may
illustrate from

one of their contemporaries, Sir John Mandeville, a clergyman,
who, writing his book in Latin, French and English, distinctly
states that he had been a great traveller.
The cross and reed

and sponge he saw at Constantinople;
he fought against Arabs

for the Sultan of Babylon
;
he vouches for Ethiopians with one

large foot and one only, used as an umbrella;
for miraculous

draughts of fishes, which came to the shore to be caught out of
pure reverence for the king of the country, who has a very large

196
Piers Plowman

family; men without heads, men with eyes in their shoulders,
dwerghes (dwarfs) with no mouths, but only a lytylle round hole,
men with
horses
feet,
all the marvels
of
the medieval map-

makers are vouched for by Sir John.
On his return he showed

his book to the Pope, who had his statements of things seen and
heard, examined, and " my book was proved for true."
In the

Roman du Renart the fox starts on pilgrimage with staff and scrip
and takes sheep and donkey (Bernart the arch-priest) with him.
Long before Erasmus, with
his
bitter
satire, the people had

begun
to
laugh at the
pilgrim;
he knew too much, he had

been too
far.
But pilgrimages are by no means things of the

past, nor can they be lightly laughed at.
" They were dangerous,

meritorious, and they showed a way to heaven.
They relieved

a man
of work, they showed him amusing
people.
He and

his
licence
were
free
of
the
roads "
(Besant).
With
staff

(bourdon) and scrip (a small bag), with bottle, rosary, shells and

flasks, or other adornments, he proved his story;
if he came from

Palestine he wore
strips
of coloured cloth, sewn cross-wise on

the shoulder, and the palm was sewn to clothes or carried
in

the
hand.
Vernicles
(the
picture
of
Christ),
crosskeys
and

effigies of S. Peter and S. Paul were worn by Roman pilgrims;
but
alas,
the Rome or Compostella
pilgrim had not always

been there.
" W. Blakeney, shetil-maker, who pretended to be

a hermit, was brought into the Guildhall for that whereas he was

able to work for his food and raiment, he went about barefoot
and with long hair under the guise of sanctity, and pretending

to be a hermit, saying he was such and that he had made pil-
grimage to Jerusalem, Rome, Venice and the city of Seville in

Spain, and had received many good things from divers persons
... he acknowledged that for the last six years he had lived
by such fetches and deceits, and that he never was in the parts

aforesaid " (Riley, 141 2).
At home, besides the great S. Thomas

and the many roods,
S. Cuthbert
at Durham,
S. William
of

York,
little
S. William of Norwich,
S. Wulfstan of Worcester,

and
S.
Swithin
of Winchester
were among
saints
to whom

pilgrimages were frequently made (Cutts).
The
reader must

be reminded that there
is no adequate ground for questioning

the
occasional
" miracles " which occurred and
still occur
in

such pilgrimages.
One of the most brilliant modern productions

of a cultivated mind and of a religious life, I refer to the Saintes

Evangiles of M. Lassere, owes its origin directly to a miraculous

cure wrought at Lourdes.
Scientists may explain, we Protes-

Comment
197

tants may question;
but neither pilgrimages nor " miracles "

are dead—yet.

The recluse—the true,
strict recluse—has nothing to recom-

mend him or her.
The ghastly silence, the dirty walled-up cell,

the long lone cold hours, form a picture compared with which the

strictest life of Carmelite or Brigittine was comfort
itself.
It is

suggested that the
slits called lepers windows were for the use

of anchorites, who had their cells outside the church walls.
It

is true that the recluse could in some cases talk to the outside

world, and was sometimes so much consulted by the women of

the place that he became a nuisance;
it
is equally true that

some recluses did enjoy comparative comfort, though they were

tied to one cell;
but the true ancre was one of those who, like

monk of the desert or trappist of to-day, is isolated, silent, dead.
The service read over him and the subsequent condition of his
days may be read and understood by the reader
of Besants

London.

Hermits were the good-tempered Timons
of the day;
they

lived
in houses, they helped
travellers, they were not always

poor.
There
is no need to waste pity on the hermit;
he came

from all ranks of society, as his modern counterpart does.
It is

not every man who is smitten with the love of the society of his
own kind;
and there are to-day hermits even in cities, as there

were in Langlands time.

But all of whom I have been speaking were officially connected

with the Church.
There remains another
class
of
friars who

roamed the country before Langland had ceased writing, and
who
carried no
licence from
pope,
bishop
or archdeacon.
I

refer to Wyclifs poor priests.
It
is doubtful whether Langland

means us to take any notice of them ; whatever may have been

his attitude to Wyclif, he either does not know the name of

Lollard, or he intends to sever himself entirely from lollers or

Lollards.
There
is no question connected with the 1381 revolt

which is so obscure as this :
did Wyclif through his poor priests

preach a social as well as an ecclesiastical revolution?
When

we find historians such as Mr. Thorold Rogers and Mr. Trevelyan
disagreeing
toto
cozlo on this point,
it
is well
for the ordinary

reader to suspend judgment.
It may be enough for us to note

that there seems to be no proof that Langlands book or any
part of
it was used to inflame the
social unrest, and another

interpretation may be put upon the often quoted passages
in

the message from the Great Society.

198
Piers Plowman

A much more profitable inquiry turns us away from pope and

cardinal,
friar
and
monk,
hermit and
pilgrim,
Wyclif
and

Swynderby, to the central figure which, as I have said before,
glances in and out of the work in such elusive and mysterious

fashion.
It is long before we meet Piers Plowman, but when we

do meet him he never wholly leaves the stage;
if not actually

speaking, his presence
is felt:
it is the book of Piers Plowman.

So strongly does the reader feel this that it has been suggested
that we have here but a fragment of genuine alliterative folk-

literature of which Piers Plowman
is the hero.
The Plowman

leads the way to Truth, whose servant he
is, and the cutpurse

and the pardoner desert him;
a stray common woman
is
left,

and he and she begin, but others join in the great pilgrimage.
Before
it
is begun the half-acre has to be ploughed, and knight

and wastrel have to help.
Ladies must help too;
the work of

all is for the weal of all, and Piers makes his last will and testa-
ment.
Then the unemployables wrangle and Piers calls Hunger

and Famine to help him;
the gentry cannot.
The pardon
is

sent by the Almighty to poor Piers Plowman, and henceforth he

is a symbol which leads men to Do-well, Do-better and Do-best.
He
is referred to as the great example, the great teacher, until

again he appears upon the scene
riding to Jerusalem
as the

Good
Samaritan
to
joust with death
for the
deliverance
of

humanity from
hell.
As
Prince he
sails
hell-wards and
the

victory
is assured.
But Piers as Christ is gone, and Antichrist

takes his place; the Piers that follows
is the
spirit of Church

unity;
the mysterious plowman, saviour, man, Christ,
is now

again lost, and must be sought for in a new Grail quest over the
wide
world.
Small wonder
that readers
are
in doubt
as
to

Langlands meaning.
I take
it that Langland wilfully confused

the character,
for
in
his own mind
there was no separation

between
the
God-in-man
and
the
man-in-God.
As
Bishop

Stubbs says, " The full likeness to Jesus Christ, the ideal Son of
God,
is stored up in the Plowman, in the common man of the

street and of the mill and of the workshop."
Above every class

and
caste, sympathising with
all, thinking nothing too
high,

nothing too low
for him to
notice,
Piers
represents
the
best

religious thought of which Langland was capable, mans likeness

to
Christ and
even
his
identification with him
being made

possible by the very nature of Christs appearance in the world.
Love could not bear to remain in heaven;
it must take mankind

on it or die.

Comment
199

Allegory pressed hard loses its charm.
If Piers Plowman were

as
clear
outlined
as
Christian, the mystery
of the Plowman

would not fit in as it does with the chaos of the scene.
He seems

to suit the kaleidoscope of the field full of folk which
is now

a
city, now a plain, now a procession, now a church, now a

court, now a desolate land along which trains of pilgrims go
and always a dream.
Battles and law courts vanish, Cornhill and

Jerusalem disappear, and the sleeper is left upon the misty hills.
From the Malvern Hills the mist never wholly goes; only now
and then
stands
out,
as
in
the Arthurian
vision,
the
great

figure—crowned

.

Yet, though the writer leaves his work in despondency and

gloom, something had been accomplished.
To have seen Piers

Plowman working in that whirl and worry of politics was some-
thing :
to have realised that figure made life worth living to the

writer, though death should be but, as he called it, the unknitter

of all care and the beginning of rest.

This
is the reward of the spiritual reformer, whether he be a

Francis, a Shelley or a Langland
: that he catches glimpses of

the impossible.
The light that never will be on land or sea is his

inspiration, and far above any amelioration of
social ethics
is

the spiritual sense of the son of man ploughing the fourteenth-
century fields, pushing the pilgrims through the strait gate and
riding through Cheapside or Jerusalem to get him his gilt spurs
and
his
slashed
shoon.
Langland, the poor wandering mass-

priest, saw over old S. Pauls the vision splendid, as a later singer,
poorer than Langland, in the same London, almost in the same

street, saw it and could write

:

"
world invisible, we view thee;

O world intangible, we touch thee;
O world unknowable, we know thee

;

Inapprehensible, we clutch thee.

The angels keep their ancient places,
Turn but a stone and start a wing;

'Tis ye, 'tis your estranged faces
That miss the many-splendoured thing.

But (when so sad thou canst not sadder)
Cry; and upon thy so sore loss

Shall shine the traffic of Jacobs ladder,
Pitched betwixt Heaven and Charing Cross.

200
Piers Plowman

Yea, in the night, my Soul, my Daughter,
Cry—clinging Heaven by the hems;
And lo, Christ walking on the water,
Not of Gennesareth but Thames! "

If we leave the religious outlook and look upon the social side

of
England, we are struck by the constant repetition
of the

note of misery.
Yet it does not appear that the century was as

bad as its successor.
The drain of the French wars must have

been felt; yet the Great Pestilence had, in its awful way, lessened
by fifty per cent, the number of mouths that had to be fed.

But Langlands complaint
is
not merely that the poor want

food and raiment;
it would appear from him that they needed

protection
against
themselves
and
against
the
great.
The

adulteration
of food and
drink, the want
of
the poor mans

lawyer, the general corruption and
deceit
all round him, the

extremes
of
luxury and
penury—these
are
the
things
that

wring his heart.
By way of
illustration the following may be

quoted from Riley as instances of dishonesty in trade;
the first

instance
being one
of
the
eternal
quack,
without whom no

century can live.

In 1382, " Roger Clerk was attached to make answer to Roger

atte Hacche that whereas no physician or surgeon should inter-
meddle with medicines but those who are experienced, the said
Roger Clerk, who knew nothing of the arts aforesaid nor under-
stood anything of letters, came to the house of him Roger atte
Hacche and there saw one Johanna, the wife of the said Roger,
who was then lying
ill, and gave the said Roger to understand

that he was experienced and skilled in the art of medicine.

" Whereupon
the
said Roger gave him
12
pence
in
part

payment
of a larger sum that he was to pay him in case the

said Johanna should be healed.
And upon this the same Roger

Clerk gave the said Roger an old parchment cut or scratched

across, being the leaf of a certain book, and rolled
it up in a

piece of cloth of gold, and this he put about her neck, but in no
way did it profit her.

" And the said Roger Clerk was asked what the worth of such

a parchment was, whereupon he said that upon it was written a
good charm for fevers.
Upon being asked by the court what

were the words of this charm, he said,
' Anima Christi sanctifica

me, corpus Christi salva me, sanguis Christi inebria me,' and the
parchment being then examined, not one
of these words was

Comment
201

found written thereon.
And he was told by the court that a

straw beneath his foot would be of as much avail for fevers as

this said charm of his was, whereupon he fully granted that it
would be so.
And because that the said Roger was in no way

a literate man, and seeing that he was found to be an infidel
and altogether ignorant of the art of physic,
it was adjudged

that the same Roger Clerk should be led through the middle of

the
city with trumpets and
pipes,
he
riding upon an
horse

without a saddle, the said parchment and a whetstone for his

lies being hung about his neck, an urinal also being hung before
him and another urinal on his back " (Riley, 465).

The following are referred to

:

"
.
.
. making pots of bad metal that come to nothing and melt

;

mixing any manner of wares whereof the good thing may be
impaired by the old; the dubbing or moistening
of any mer-

chandise, by reason whereof the weight may be increased ;
selling

putrid beef; making of hats, shoes or brides of poor or forbidden
material
.
.
. stealing dough by making holes in the tables used

for baking; using
false nets in the Thames;
selling
ale out of

tankards with thickened bottoms.

" Godfrey le Rede was attached with his bread, and this bread

was weighed and adjudicated upon before Stephen de Alyndone,
mayor, and
it was found that the penny loaf of light bread of

the
said Godfrey weighed
155-., and was wanting
of
its
right

weight to the amount of 8.2J, and upon this he said he did not
make the loaf aforesaid nor had any share therein for gain or

for love, and he put himself upon the country as to the same.
And the country (jury) came by John de Kyngyestone, pelterer,
and others in the panel.
Who being sworn said upon their oath

that George the aforesaid is partner with John de Jernemue and
Robert de Donstaple, bakers, who keep a bakehouse without
Newgate
just opposite Cokkes-lane, and
that he
shares with

them in the said bakehouse and
is their oven-man.
Therefore

it was adjudged
that he should have the punishment
of the

hurdle" (Riley, 119).

" John Rightwys and John Penrose, taverners, being accused

of selling red wine unsound and unwholesome, John Rightwys
was acquitted and John Penrose shall drink a draught of the
same wine and
the remainder
shall be poured on
his head "

(Riley, 1364).

202
Piers Plowman

" Robin Porter, servant of John Gibbe, baker of Stratford,

when the bread inspection came, knowing that the bread of his
master was not of full weight, took a penny loaf and in it falsely
and fraudulently inserted a piece of iron weighing about 4 oz.
with intent to make the said loaf weigh more in deceit of the
people " (Riley, 1387).

As a lover of the poor Langland hated adulteration; but it is

difficult to understand why he shared so clearly with the 1381
rebellion its hatred of lawyers.
We can see why the Rev. John

Ball and his well-to-do friends burnt manor-rolls and charters
and hunted lawyers to death.
A lawyer to them meant a man

who carried out or brought into operation the hated statutes
which for forty years tried to fix wages after the Black Death.
But Langland, as Jusserand says, cursed the revolt, and explicitly

states that he did not sympathise with the cry for high wages.

I think the explanation lies in Langlands belief that no juryman
or
siser, no
panel, no
inquest or
collection
of witnesses and

neighbours collected to weigh the truth was ever honest.
They

were
all got at by Meed.
And the poor man, being poor and

unversed in the ways of bribery, could get no lawyer to help
him.
There was no man to set the poor right in the usage of the

law courts, civil and
ecclesiastical.
Justice should have been

freely administered, not bought and
sold, nor even paid
for.

Langlands Utopia
is
still Utopia, for even to-day the friendly

lawyer will counsel his friend to keep clear of the honest but

distrusted courts—distrusted because of long bills and unsatis-

factory conclusions.
The poor mans doctor
is with us, a real

blessing;
but the poor mans lawyer has
not
yet made
his

appearance in the land.

Of corruption Langland cannot say enough.
Meed
is over

all; Simony,the worst bane of the medieval Church (as a Catholic

writer puts
it), was only one of the hydras heads.
The most

shameless bribery went on in high places, and no more disgraceful

instance can be given than that of Richard Lyon, a condemned

minister of the Crown, who actually sent a barrel of gold to the
dying Prince,
in order to win his help.
To
insult the Black

Prince thus at any time of his life would have been bad enough,
but so to deride and flatter the purest friend of the commons
when he lay helpless and in grievous
pain
seems one
of
the

most shameless acts in history.

Beyond the corruption and the inability to get justice done

Comment
203

for the poor man, Langland turned his careful and observant
eye on luxury, especially on luxury in dress.
Chaucer is at one

with him, and though he laughs at the excess of dress in his
poems, in his prose he very nearly calls it one of the eight deadly

sins.
It would seem as
if modern luxury in dress were really

less than that of the fourteenth century, and the wife of Baths
matinee hat was as broad as
is a targe, surely an acreage to

which we have not yet attained.
The regulations of the time

are very particular in their condemnation of the use of various

furs by the common lewd women who dwell in the city of London,
forbidding them to wear any manner of noble budge; but Pernel
Proudheart was by no
means
the
only
offender;
in
1363

sumptuary laws had been passed regulating the dress of England.
Even the clergy dressed in all colours and carried short swords,
and it is said did not always take the trouble to put on a black
gown at a funeral.

As
for arms and armour, Langland seems to hate them far

more than the luxurious dress.
He was no soldier like Chaucer,

and took no delight in enumerating the pieces of armour worn by
the knight.
To him armour meant weapons and weapons meant

wounds, and war was as barbarous as it had seemed to the old
Hebrew prophet.
Chivalry and its accompanying virtues meant

less than nothing and vanity to the chantry priest;
and very

greatly would he have disapproved of Robert Newby, rector of
Whitchurch, who leaves his brother his best sword ;
of the vicar

of Gaynford, who leaves his best suit of armour and
all of his

arrows;
still more would he have admonished John Wyndhill,

% rector of Arnecliffe, who in 1431 leaves a copy of Piers Plowman
and green sanguine and murrey gowns and a baselard (knife)
with ivory and silver handle.

He
dislikes the
feasting and the minstrels
as much
as the

weapons;
they
are Judas children, tellers of loose stories, and

he would have answered to any one of them who
said he had

a licence as the indignant sixteenth-century writer
answered,

" Have you a licence from Christ Jesus? "

These fighters and minstrels and wastrels moved him to fierce

indignation.
But
his heaviest wrath
is reserved
for the
dis-

contented workman, and for the man who will notwork.
Though

he hated lawyers who
tried
to get the
Statute
of Labourers

enforced, he had no sympathy at all with the men who wished
to force wages higher.
It is amusing to see how many statutes

and
regulations were passed against the able-bodied beggars.

204
Piers Plowman

No person, according to statute, was allowed to relieve them,
and in 1359 occurs the following entry:

" Forasmuch as many men and women and others of divers

counties who might work to the help of the common people have
betaken themselves out
of
their own country
to
the City
of

London, and do go about begging there so as to have their own

ease and repose, not wishing to labour or work for their sus-
tenance, to the great damage of such the common people, and

also do waste divers alms which would otherwise be given to
many poor folk such as lepers, blind, halt and persons oppressed
with old age and divers other maladies, we do therefore com-
mand that all those who go about begging and who are able to
work shall quit the said city between now and Monday next "

(Riley).

" John Warde
of York and R. Lynham
of Somerset were

questioned for that whereas they were stout enough to work for

their food and raiment and had their tongues to talk with, they
did
pretend
they
were
mutes,
they went
about
carrying
a

two-ell measure and an iron hook and pincers and a piece of

leather in shape like a part of a tongue edged with silver and
with writing around it:
' This is the tongue of R. Warde:
'
with

which instruments they gave persons to understand they were

traders and that they had been plundered and robbed of their
goods, they making an horrible noise like unto a roaring and
opening their mouths, to the manifest deceit of the whole of the
people " (Riley, 1380).

An extract from the Standard of October 6, 191 1,
is interest-

ing by way of comment

:

" William Thomas, a blind maker, of East Surrey Road, was

charged with begging from foot passengers at Rosebery Avenue,

Clerkenwell.
A constable said he heard Thomas say to a gentle-

Langlands time branks (leathern gags) were used.
As
for the

inefficiency
of work
of which Langland
so
bitterly complains,

the reader may be referred to The Common Growth of Miss M.

L<oane, written last year:

" In another small town where lads professed that work of

any kind was extremely hard to get, I found an old established
tradesman, a leading
councillor and a
J.P., taking down the

shutters and sweeping out the shop. ...
I had the loafing son

of a widow
in my mind.
The worthy
justice
also knew the

widows son and many others.
Clinging to his broom he hastily

assured me that the loss of time was nothing compared with
what he had wasted in trying to make boys do the work."

And Langlands beggars, who will have hot meat quite hot, and
that of the best, find their modern counterparts

:

" As to bacon, I can't get them (cottagers) to try good Danish

at 8%d., though ordinary English
is up to nd. just now, and

the best
is at a fancy price.
And none but the best English

cheese will do for them, however small a bit their money will
run to."
The Common Growth (Miss M. Loane), 191 1.

Truly the fourteenth century does not seem to be so very far

away.

The tragic events in the period of history over which Langland

cast his eye were the Black Death of 1349, the death of the
Black Prince
in 1376, and the Peasants Revolt of 1381.
The

Black Death, by emptying the land of labour, was the cause of
the famous
statute by which for forty years an attempt was

made to regulate and keep down the wages of the free-contracting

labourer.
The consequent discontent, rendered greater by the

continuation
of
the French wars,
swelled
into
the
Peasants

Revolt;
but that revolt would
in
all probability never have

occurred had
the Black Prince, who was on the
side
of the

disaffected, lived to make headway against the nobles.
Parlia-

ment, though ready to fight for the people, could do little;
the

deeds of the Good Parliament of 1376 were writ in water;
" all

its acts were cancelled, and the statute-book bears no trace of
the
greatest assembly
of the period."
The day of reckoning

came.
Opinions are freely divided on the subject of the revolt.

We seem to know everything about it except the answer to this
question, " Who was at the back of it ? "
Some say the well-to-do

206
Piers Plowman

middle class in the country;
some hint that the youthful king

used the revolt,
if he did not actually suggest
it, as a weapon

against the great nobles.
Some again say, while others deny,

that Wyclifs poor
priests engineered what was known
as the

Great
Society.
We may be
certain
of
this,
that Langland

strongly
disapproved
of
it,
although,
as
Professor
Thorold

Rogers thinks, the revolt may have put back the Reformation

for a century and a half.
The revolt failed, and Langland, seeing

only its turbulence and murders, was content that it should fail;
he had no hopes for his day from any social change;
the horizon

was that of " the collied night; "
he was a social reformer from

one standpoint only—the standpoint of religion.
Without this,

according to him,
all
social reform
is meaningless, and must

lead to greater luxury and greater discontent.
None but Piers

Plowman can save the people that he loved.

For above all writers he is the peoples friend.
None
is more

intolerant of their sad condition, none
is more outspoken than

he to king, bishop, knight, friar and huckster.
The poor he has

always in his heart.
We do well to put up statues to Howard

and
to
Quintin Hogg, and Guy dreams
in
stone among the

people whom he helped ; but as yet no statue stands in Cornhill,
no glass blazes in the Abbey in memory of this champion of the

poor.
Perhaps
it
is better
so, considering
his indignant con-

demnation of the stained window and the church advertisement.
Like Thomas a Kempis, he would prefer to be unknown and
thought nothing of; and his work is, by wicked irony, interesting
only to the student of history and the examinee.
The book,

however, demands—and never more loudly than now—that
it

should be read again and again by any who care to
see the

bitterness and the hope, the despair and the exultation of him
who wrote four centuries ago the Vision of the Peoples Christ.
