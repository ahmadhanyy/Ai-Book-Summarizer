Michael Witmore

Director, Folger Shakespeare Library

It is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their
composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems
have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to
make them their own.

Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process
of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings
in language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,
new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a
mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds.
These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource
for study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic
texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The
Folger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a
trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.

The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis
for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their
origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the
single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An
unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and
artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been
consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions
also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of
Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.

I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul
Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s
works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a
richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers
who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow
the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the
Folger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and
digital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I
commend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.

From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare

Library

Until now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly
Folger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of
Shakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the
Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of
the plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that
there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But
Shakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or
plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some
cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published
versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great
collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First
Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of
Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others.
Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then
amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other
versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate
text.

Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an
unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the
period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that
made it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred
years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on
cultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,
for example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda
to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The
Tempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not
take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare
editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her
father, Prospero.

The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long
before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to
make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The
Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger
Shakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly
transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,
which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger
Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial
interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from
Othello: “ If she in chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square
brackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood  and sword and
fire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from

Textual Introduction

By Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine

Hamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier.  Who hath relieved/you?”). At
any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for
more information.

Because the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with
twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger
here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,
and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the
plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study
and enjoyment of Shakespeare.

Human nature and the law often collide in Measure for Measure. As
the play begins, the Duke of Vienna announces he is going away and
puts his deputy Angelo in charge of the state. Angelo immediately
enforces a law prohibiting sex outside of marriage, sentencing
Claudio to death for sleeping with Juliet, Claudio’s now-pregnant
fiancée.

Claudio’s sister Isabella, a novice nun, appeals to Angelo to save her
brother. But the supposedly pure Angelo demands that Isabella sleep
with him to save Claudio. To Claudio’s dismay, Isabella refuses.

The duke, who has remained in Vienna disguised as a friar, suggests
that Angelo’s jilted fiancée, Mariana, could take Isabella’s place.
Although the trick succeeds, Angelo orders Claudio beheaded
anyway. The duke saves Claudio, but he tells Isabella that Claudio is
dead.

The duke, resuming his identity, sentences Angelo to wed Mariana
and then be put to death. But Mariana and Isabella plead for
Angelo’s life. Revealing that Claudio is alive, the duke pardons
Angelo and proposes to Isabella.

 Look where he comes.

  
 Angelo,

 There is a kind of character in thy life
 That to th’ observer doth thy history
 Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
 Are not thine own so proper as to waste
 Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
 Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
 Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
 Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike
 As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touched
 But to fine issues, nor nature never lends
 The smallest scruple of her excellence
 But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
 Herself the glory of a creditor,
 Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
 To one that can my part in him advertise.
 Hold, therefore, Angelo.
 In our remove be thou at full ourself.
 Mortality and mercy in Vienna
 Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,
 Though first in question, is thy secondary.
 Take thy commission. 

  
 Now, good my lord,

 Let there be some more test made of my mettle

 Be stamped upon it.

  
 No more evasion.

 We have with a leavened and preparèd choice
 Proceeded to you. Therefore, take your honors.
 Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
 That it prefers itself and leaves unquestioned
 Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
 As time and our concernings shall importune,
 How it goes with us, and do look to know
 What doth befall you here. So fare you well.
 To th’ hopeful execution do I leave you
 Of your commissions.

  
 Yet give leave, my lord,

 That we may bring you something on the way.

  My haste may not admit it.

 Nor need you, on mine honor, have to do
 With any scruple. Your scope is as mine own,
 So to enforce or qualify the laws
 As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand.
 I’ll privily away. I love the people,
 But do not like to stage me to their eyes.
 Though it do well, I do not relish well
 Their loud applause and aves vehement,
 Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
 That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

  I thank you. Fare you well. 

, to Angelo
 

 I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
 To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
 To look into the bottom of my place.

 scraped one out of the table.

  “Thou shalt not steal”?

  Ay, that he razed.

  Why, ’twas a commandment to command

 They put forth to steal. There’s not a soldier of

  Marry, sir, that’s Claudio, Signior Claudio.

  Claudio to prison? ’Tis not so.

  Nay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him arrested, saw

 him carried away; and, which is more, within these
 three days his head to be chopped off.

  But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so!

 Art thou sure of this?

  I am too sure of it. And it is for getting Madam

 Julietta with child.

  Believe me, this may be. He promised to meet

 me two hours since, and he was ever precise in
 promise-keeping.

 With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

  
 Unhappily, even so.

 And the new deputy now for the Duke—
 Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
 Or whether that the body public be
 A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
 Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
 He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
 Whether the tyranny be in his place
 Or in his eminence that fills it up,
 I stagger in—but this new governor
 Awakes me all the enrollèd penalties
 Which have, like unscoured armor, hung by th’ wall
 So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round,
 And none of them been worn; and for a name
 Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
 Freshly on me. ’Tis surely for a name.

  I warrant it is. And thy head stands so tickle on

 thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may
 sigh it off. Send after the Duke and appeal to him.

 The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;
 Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
 In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,
 By those that know the very nerves of state,
 His givings-out  were of an infinite distance
 From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
 And with full line of his authority,
 Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood
 Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
 The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
 But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
 With profits of the mind: study and fast.
 He—to give fear to use and liberty,
 Which have for long run by the hideous law
 As mice by lions—hath picked out an act
 Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life
 Falls into forfeit. He arrests him on it,
 And follows close the rigor of the statute
 To make him an example. All hope is gone
 Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
 To soften Angelo. And that’s my pith of business
 ’Twixt you and your poor brother.

 Honor two notorious benefactors.

  Benefactors? Well, what benefactors are they?

 Are they not malefactors?

  If it please your Honor, I know not well what

 they are, but precise villains they are, that I am sure
 of, and void of all profanation in the world that
 good Christians ought to have.

, to Angelo
  This comes off well. Here’s a wise

 officer.

, to Elbow
  Go to. What quality are they of?

 Elbow is your name? Why dost thou not speak,
 Elbow?

  He cannot, sir. He’s out at elbow.
  What are you, sir?
  He, sir? A tapster, sir, parcel bawd; one that

 serves a bad woman, whose house, sir, was, as they
 say, plucked down in the suburbs, and now she
 professes a hothouse, which I think is a very ill
 house too.

  How know you that?

  My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and

 your Honor—

  How? Thy wife?

  Ay, sir, whom I thank heaven is an honest

 woman—

  Dost thou detest her therefore?

  I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she,

 that this house, if it be not a bawd’s house, it is pity
 of her life, for it is a naughty house.

  How dost thou know that, constable?

  Marry, sir, by my wife, who, if she had been a

 woman cardinally given, might have been accused

  By the woman’s means?

  Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone’s means; but as

 she spit in his face, so she defied him.

  Sir, if it please your Honor, this is

 not so.

  Prove it before these varlets here, thou honorable

 man, prove it.

, to Angelo
  Do you hear how he misplaces?

  Sir, she came in great with child, and longing,

 saving your Honor’s reverence, for stewed prunes.
 Sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
 distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit dish, a dish
 of some threepence; your Honors have seen such
 dishes; they are not china dishes, but very good
 dishes—

  Go to, go to. No matter for the dish, sir.
  No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in

 the right. But to the point: as I say, this Mistress
 Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and being great-bellied,
 and longing, as I said, for prunes; and
 having but two in the dish, as I said, Master Froth
 here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I said,
 and, as I say, paying for them very honestly—for, as
 you know, Master Froth, I could not give you threepence
 again—

  No, indeed.

  Very well. You being then, if you be remembered,

 cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes—

  Ay, so I did indeed.

  Why, very well. I telling you then, if you be

 remembered, that such a one and such a one were
 past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept
 very good diet, as I told you—

  All this is true.

  Ay, sir, very well.
  Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.

  Doth your Honor see any harm in his face?

 the Constable’s wife any harm? I would know that

  First, an it like you, the house is a respected

 house; next, this is a respected fellow, and his
 mistress is a respected woman.

  By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected

 person than any of us all.

  Nine?—Come hither to me, Master Froth.

 Master Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
 tapsters; they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
 will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no

 Pompey, howsoever you color it in being a tapster,
 are you not? Come, tell me true. It shall be the

  Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
  How would you live, Pompey? By being a

 bawd? What do you think of the trade, Pompey? Is it
 a lawful trade?

  If the law would allow it, sir.
  But the law will not allow it, Pompey, nor it

 shall not be allowed in Vienna.

  Does your Worship mean to geld and splay all

 the youth of the city?

  No, Pompey.
  Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to ’t

 then. If your Worship will take order for the drabs
 and the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.

  There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell

 you. It is but heading and hanging.

  If you head and hang all that offend that way

 but for ten year together, you’ll be glad to give out a
 commission for more heads. If this law hold in
 Vienna ten year, I’ll rent the fairest house in it after
 threepence a bay. If you live to see this come to
 pass, say Pompey told you so.

  Thank you, good Pompey. And in requital of

 your prophecy, hark you: I advise you let me not
 find you before me again upon any complaint
 whatsoever; no, not for dwelling where you do. If I
 do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent and prove
 a shrewd Caesar to you. In plain dealing, Pompey, I
 shall have you whipped. So, for this time, Pompey,
 fare you well.

 Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
 Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
 That modesty may more betray our sense
 Than woman’s lightness? Having waste ground

 enough,

 Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
 And pitch our evils there? O fie, fie, fie!
 What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
 Dost thou desire her foully for those things
 That make her good? O, let her brother live.
 Thieves for their robbery have authority
 When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her
 That I desire to hear her speak again
 And feast upon her eyes? What is ’t I dream on?
 O cunning enemy that, to catch a saint,
 With saints dost bait thy hook. Most dangerous
 Is that temptation that doth goad us on
 To sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet
 With all her double vigor, art and nature,
 Once stir my temper, but this virtuous maid
 Subdues me quite. Ever till now
 When men were fond, I smiled and wondered how.

 For his advantage that I dearly love.

 Owe and succeed thy weakness.

  Nay, women are frail too.

 And from this testimony of your own sex,
 Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
 Than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold.

 That is, a woman. If you be more, you’re none.

 By all external warrants, show it now
 By putting on the destined livery.

 That you shall stifle in your own report
 And smell of calumny. I have begun,
 And now I give my sensual race the rein.
 Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
 Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
 That banish what they sue for. Redeem thy brother
 By yielding up thy body to my will,
 Or else he must not only die the death,
 But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
 To ling’ring sufferance. Answer me tomorrow,

 Be absolute for death. Either death or life
 Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
 If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
 That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,
 Servile to all the skyey influences
 That doth  this habitation where thou keep’st
 Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art death’s fool,
 For him thou labor’st by thy flight to shun,
 And yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble,
 For all th’ accommodations that thou bear’st
 Are nursed by baseness. Thou ’rt by no means

 valiant,

 For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
 Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
 And that thou oft provok’st, yet grossly fear’st
 Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself,
 For thou exists on many a thousand grains

 That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not,
 For what thou hast not, still thou striv’st to get,
 And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain,
 For thy complexion shifts to strange effects
 After the moon. If thou art rich, thou ’rt poor,
 For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
 Thou bear’st thy heavy riches but a journey,
 And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none,
 For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,
 The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
 Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum
 For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor

 age,

 But as it were an after-dinner’s sleep
 Dreaming on both, for all thy blessèd youth
 Becomes as agèd and doth beg the alms
 Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
 Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty
 To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this
 That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
 Lie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear,
 That makes these odds all even.

 To sue to live, I find I seek to die,
 And seeking death, find life. Let it come on.

 In thrilling region of thick-ribbèd ice,
 To be imprisoned in the viewless winds
 And blown with restless violence round about
 The pendent world; or to be worse than worst

 Imagine howling—’tis too horrible.

 be stolen out of other affairs, but I will attend you

, as Friar, taking Claudio aside
  Son, I have overheard

 what hath passed between you and your
 sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her;
 only he hath made an assay of her virtue, to practice
 his judgment with the disposition of natures. She,
 having the truth of honor in her, hath made him
 that gracious denial which he is most glad to
 receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this
 to be true. Therefore prepare yourself to death. Do
 not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are
 fallible. Tomorrow you must die. Go to your knees
 and make ready.

  Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of

 love with life that I will sue to be rid of it.

  Hold you there. Farewell.—Provost, a

 word with you.

Enter Provost.

  What’s your will, father?

  That now you are come, you will be

 promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by
 my company.

  In good time. 

, as Friar, to Isabella
  The hand that hath made

 you fair hath made you good. The goodness that is
 cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness,
 but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall
 keep the body of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo
 hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my
 understanding; and but that frailty hath examples
 for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How will
 you do to content this substitute and to save your
 brother?

  I am now going to resolve him. I had rather

 my brother die by the law than my son should be
 unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good
 duke deceived in Angelo! If ever he return, and I
 can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
 discover his government.
, as Friar
  That shall not be much amiss. Yet, as

 the matter now stands, he will avoid your accusation:
 he made trial of you only. Therefore, fasten
 your ear on my advisings. To the love I have in doing
 good, a remedy presents itself. I do make myself
 believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor
 wronged lady a merited benefit, redeem your brother
 from the angry law, do no stain to your own
 gracious person, and much please the absent duke,
 if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing
 of this business.

  Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to

 do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my
 spirit.
, as Friar
  Virtue is bold, and goodness never

 fearful. Have you not heard speak of Mariana, the
 sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried
 at sea?

  I have heard of the lady, and good words

 went with her name.
, as Friar
  She should this Angelo have married,

 was affianced to her oath, and the nuptial appointed.
 Between which time of the contract and
 limit of the solemnity, her brother Frederick was
 wracked at sea, having in that perished vessel the
 dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this befell
 to the poor gentlewoman. There she lost a noble
 and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever
 most kind and natural; with him, the portion and
 sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry; with

 both, her combinate husband, this well-seeming
 Angelo.

  Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?

, as Friar
  Left her in her tears and dried not one

 of them with his comfort, swallowed his vows
 whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonor; in
 few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which
 she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her
 tears, is washed with them but relents not.

  What a merit were it in death to take this

 poor maid from the world! What corruption in this
 life, that it will let this man live! But how out of this
 can she avail?
, as Friar
  It is a rupture that you may easily heal,

 and the cure of it not only saves your brother, but
 keeps you from dishonor in doing it.

  Show me how, good father.

, as Friar
  This forenamed maid hath yet in her

 the continuance of her first affection. His unjust
 unkindness, that in all reason should have
 quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the
 current, made it more violent and unruly. Go you to
 Angelo, answer his requiring with a plausible obedience,
 agree with his demands to the point. Only
 refer yourself to this advantage: first, that your stay
 with him may not be long, that the time may have all
 shadow and silence in it, and the place answer to
 convenience. This being granted in course, and
 now follows all: we shall advise this wronged maid
 to stead up your appointment, go in your place. If
 the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may
 compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is
 your brother saved, your honor untainted, the poor
 Mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy
 scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for his
 attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may,

  It lies much in your holding up. Haste

 you to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I

  Go to kennel, Pompey, go.

 What news, friar, of the Duke?
, as Friar
  I know none. Can you tell me of any?

  Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia;

 other some, he is in Rome. But where is he, think
 you?
, as Friar
  I know not where, but wheresoever, I

 wish him well.

  It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal

 from the state and usurp the beggary he was never
 born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence.
 He puts transgression to ’t.
, as Friar
  He does well in ’t.

  A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm

 in him. Something too crabbed that way, friar.
, as Friar
  It is too general a vice, and severity

 must cure it.

  Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;

 it is well allied, but it is impossible to extirp it quite,
 friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say
 this Angelo was not made by man and woman after
 this downright way of creation. Is it true, think
 you?
, as Friar
  How should he be made, then?

  Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some,

 that he was begot between two stockfishes. But it is
 certain that when he makes water, his urine is
 congealed ice; that I know to be true. And he is a
 motion generative, that’s infallible.
, as Friar
  You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

  Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the

 rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
 man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
 Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting
 a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the

 detected for women. He was not inclined that way.

  O, sir, you are deceived.

  Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the

 Duke, and I believe I know the cause of his
 withdrawing.
, as Friar
  What, I prithee, might be the cause?

  No, pardon. ’Tis a secret must be locked within

 the teeth and the lips. But this I can let you
 understand: the greater file of the subject held the
 Duke to be wise.
, as Friar
  Wise? Why, no question but he was.

  A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

 mistaking. The very stream of his life and the

 shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman,

 to make your answer before him. If it be honest you
 have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am
 bound to call upon you, and, I pray you, your name?

  Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.

, as Friar
  He shall know you better, sir, if I may

 live to report you.

  I fear you not.

, as Friar
  O, you hope the Duke will return no

 more, or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite.
 But indeed I can do you little harm; you’ll
 forswear this again.

  I’ll be hanged first. Thou art deceived in me,

 friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio
 die tomorrow or no?
, as Friar
  Why should he die, sir?

  Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would

 the Duke we talk of were returned again. This
 ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
 continency. Sparrows must not build in his house
 eaves, because they are lecherous. The Duke yet
 would have dark deeds darkly answered. He would
 never bring them to light Would he were returned.
 Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
 Farewell, good friar. I prithee pray for me. The
 Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
 Fridays. He’s now past it, yet—and I say to thee—
 he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt
 brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Farewell.

  Good my lord, be good to me. Your Honor is

, to Escalus
  My lord, this is one Lucio’s information

 against me. Mistress Kate Keepdown was
 with child by him in the Duke’s time; he promised
 her marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old
 come Philip and Jacob. I have kept it myself, and see
 how he goes about to abuse me.

  That fellow is a fellow of much license. Let

 him be called before us. Away with her to prison.—
 Go to, no more words. 
 Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered.
 Claudio must die tomorrow. Let him be furnished
 with divines and have all charitable preparation. If
 my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be so

 Of gracious order, late come from the See
 In special business from his Holiness.

  What news abroad i’ th’ world?

, as Friar
  None but that there is so great a fever

 on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it.
 Novelty is only in request, and it is as dangerous to
 be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be
 constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth
 enough alive to make societies secure, but security
 enough to make fellowships accursed. Much upon
 this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news
 is old enough, yet it is every day’s news. I pray you,
 sir, of what disposition was the Duke?

  One that, above all other strifes, contended

 especially to know himself.
, as Friar
  What pleasure was he given to?

  Rather rejoicing to see another merry than

 merry at anything which professed to make him
 rejoice—a gentleman of all temperance. But leave
 we him to his events, with a prayer they may prove
 prosperous, and let me desire to know how you find
 Claudio prepared. I am made to understand that
 you have lent him visitation.
, as Friar
  He professes to have received no

 sinister measure from his judge but most willingly
 humbles himself to the determination of justice. Yet
 had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his
 frailty, many deceiving promises of life, which I, by
 my good leisure, have discredited to him, and now
 is he resolved to die.

  You have paid the heavens your function and

 the prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
 labored for the poor gentleman to the extremest
 shore of my modesty, but my brother justice have I
 found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him
 he is indeed Justice.

  Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield

  Ay, sir, a mystery.

  Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery;

 and your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
 using painting, do prove my occupation a
 mystery; but what mystery there should be in hanging,
 if I should be hanged, I cannot imagine.

  Sir, it is a mystery.

 than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not to do your
 office, as you will answer it at your peril.
 What say you to this, sir?

  What is that Barnardine who is to be

 executed in th’ afternoon?

  A Bohemian born, but here nursed up and

 bred; one that is a prisoner nine years old.
, as Friar
  How came it that the absent duke had

 not either delivered him to his liberty, or executed
 him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.

  His friends still wrought reprieves for him;

 and indeed his fact, till now in the government of
 Lord Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.
, as Friar
  It is now apparent?

  Most manifest, and not denied by himself.

, as Friar
  Hath he borne himself penitently in

 prison? How seems he to be touched?

  A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully

 but as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and
 fearless of what’s past, present, or to come; insensible
 of mortality and desperately mortal.
, as Friar
  He wants advice.

  He will hear none. He hath evermore had the

 liberty of the prison; give him leave to escape
 hence, he would not. Drunk many times a day, if not
 many days entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked
 him, as if to carry him to execution, and showed
 him a seeming warrant for it. It hath not moved him
 at all.
, as Friar
  More of him anon. There is written in

 your brow, provost, honesty and constancy; if I read
 it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me. But in the
 boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.

 the which you are to do me both a present and a
 dangerous courtesy.

  Pray, sir, in what?

  In the delaying death.

  Alack, how may I do it, having the hour

 limited, and an express command, under penalty,
 to deliver his head in the view of Angelo? I may
 make my case as Claudio’s, to cross this in the
 smallest.

  By the vow of mine order I warrant

 you, if my instructions may be your guide. Let this
 Barnardine be this morning executed and his head
 borne to Angelo.

  Angelo hath seen them both and will discover

 the favor.

  O, death’s a great disguiser, and you

 may add to it. Shave the head and tie the beard, and
 say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared
 before his death. You know the course is common.
 If anything fall to you upon this, more than thanks
 and good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I
 will plead against it with my life.

  Pardon me, good father, it is against my oath.

  I know them both.

, as Friar
  The contents of this is the return of the

 Duke; you shall anon overread it at your pleasure,
 where you shall find within these two days he will
 be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows not, for
 he this very day receives letters of strange tenor,
 perchance of the Duke’s death, perchance entering
 into some monastery, but by chance nothing of
 what is writ. Look, th’ unfolding star calls up the
 shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how
 these things should be. All difficulties are but easy
 when they are known. Call your executioner, and
 off with Barnardine’s head. I will give him a present
 shrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are

  O, sir, you must. And therefore I

 Here in the prison, father,

 There died this morning of a cruel fever
 One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
 A man of Claudio’s years, his beard and head
 Just of his color. What if we do omit
 This reprobate till he were well inclined,
 And satisfy the Deputy with the visage
 Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

 O, ’tis an accident that heaven provides!
 Dispatch it presently. The hour draws on
 Prefixed by Angelo. See this be done
 And sent according to command, whiles I
 Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

 Let this be done:

 Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and

 Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
 To yonder  generation, you shall find
 Your safety manifested.

 And dull to all proceedings. A deflowered maid,
 And by an eminent body that enforced
 The law against it. But that her tender shame
 Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
 How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no,
 For my authority bears of a credent bulk
 That no particular scandal once can touch
 But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
 Save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense
 Might in the times to come have ta’en revenge
 By so receiving a dishonored life
 With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived.
 Alack, when once our grace we have forgot,
 Nothing goes right. We would, and we would not.

 As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius’  house
 And tell him where I stay. Give the like notice

 And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate.

 come, sir. Foh, sir! Why you bald-pated, lying rascal,

 Must have a word anon.—Lay hold on him.

, to Escalus
 

 What you have spoke I pardon. Sit you down.
 We’ll borrow place of him.  To Angelo.  Sir, by your

 leave.

 Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence
 That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
 Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
 And hold no longer out.

  
 O my dread lord,

 I should be guiltier than my guiltiness
 To think I can be undiscernible,
 When I perceive your Grace, like power divine,
 Hath looked upon my passes. Then, good prince,
 No longer session hold upon my shame,
 But let my trial be mine own confession.
 Immediate sentence then and sequent death
 Is all the grace I beg.

  
 Come hither, Mariana.

  To Angelo.  Say, wast thou e’er contracted to this

 woman?

  I was, my lord.

  To Friar Peter.  Do you the office, friar, which

 consummate,

 Return him here again.—Go with him, provost.

  
 Come hither, Isabel.

 Your friar is now your prince. As I was then
 Advertising and holy to your business,
 Not changing heart with habit, I am still
 Attorneyed at your service.

  
 O, give me pardon

 That I, your vassal, have employed and pained
 Your unknown sovereignty.

  
 You are pardoned,

 Isabel.

 And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
 Your brother’s death, I know, sits at your heart,
 And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
 Laboring to save his life, and would not rather
 Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
 Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
 It was the swift celerity of his death,
 Which I did think with slower foot came on,
 That brained my purpose. But peace be with him.
 That life is better life past fearing death
 Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,
 So happy is your brother.

  
 I do, my lord.

Enter Angelo, Mariana,  Friar  Peter, and  Provost.

 For Mariana’s sake. But as he adjudged your

 brother—

 Being criminal in double violation
 Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
 Thereon dependent for your brother’s life—
 The very mercy of the law cries out
 Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
 “An Angelo for Claudio, death for death.”
 Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
 Like doth quit like, and measure still for

 measure.—

 Then, Angelo, thy fault’s thus manifested,
 Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee

 vantage.

 We do condemn thee to the very block
 Where Claudio stooped to death, and with like

 haste.—

 Away with him.

  
 O my most gracious lord,

 I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

  
 O my dear lord,

 I crave no other nor no better man.

 Gentle my liege—

 you.

  
 Isabel,

 Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me,
 Hold up your hands, say nothing. I’ll speak all.
 They say best men are molded out of faults,
 And, for the most, become much more the better
 For being a little bad. So may my husband.
 O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

, kneeling
  
 Most bounteous sir,

 Look, if it please you, on this man condemned
 As if my brother lived. I partly think
 A due sincerity governed his deeds
 Till he did look on me. Since it is so,
 Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
 In that he did the thing for which he died.
 For Angelo,
 His act did not o’ertake his bad intent,
 And must be buried but as an intent
 That perished by the way. Thoughts are no subjects,
 Intents but merely thoughts.

  
 Merely, my lord.

 I have bethought me of another fault.—

 Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
 At an unusual hour?

  
 It was commanded so.

  
 Pardon me, noble lord.

 I thought it was a fault, but knew it not,
 Yet did repent me after more advice,
 For testimony whereof, one in the prison
 That should by private order else have died,
 I have reserved alive.

  What’s he?

  His name is Barnardine.

, to Angelo
 

 I am sorry one so learnèd and so wise
 As you, Lord Angelo, have still appeared,
 Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood
 And lack of tempered judgment afterward.

Enter Barnardine and Provost, Claudio, muffled,

and  Juliet.

, to Isabella
 

 If he be like your brother, for his sake
 Is he pardoned; and for your lovely sake,
 Give me your hand and say you will be mine,
 He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.
 By this Lord Angelo perceives he’s safe;
 Methinks I see a quick’ning in his eye.—
 Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well.
 Look that you love your wife, her worth worth

 yours.

 I find an apt remission in myself.
 And yet here’s one in place I cannot pardon.
  To Lucio.  You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a

 coward,

 One all of luxury, an ass, a madman.
 Wherein have I so deserved of you
 That you extol me thus?

  Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the

 trick. If you will hang me for it, you may, but I had
 rather it would please you I might be whipped.

  Whipped first, sir, and hanged after.—

 Proclaim it, provost, round about the city,
 If any woman wronged by this lewd fellow—
 As I have heard him swear himself there’s one
 Whom he begot with child—let her appear,
 And he shall marry her. The nuptial finished,
 Let him be whipped and hanged.

  I beseech your Highness do not marry me to a

 whore. Your Highness said even now I made you a
 duke. Good my lord, do not recompense me in
 making me a cuckold.

  Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,

 whipping, and hanging.

  Slandering a prince deserves it.

 She, Claudio, that you wronged, look you restore.—
 Joy to you, Mariana.—Love her, Angelo.
 I have confessed her, and I know her virtue.—
 Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness.
 There’s more behind that is more gratulate.—
 Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy.
 We shall employ thee in a worthier place.—
 Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
 The head of Ragozine for Claudio’s.
 Th’ offense pardons itself.—Dear Isabel,
 I have a motion much imports your good,
 Whereto if you’ll a willing ear incline,
 What’s mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.—
 So, bring us to our palace, where we’ll show
 What’s yet behind that’s  meet you all should know.
