Michael Witmore

Director, Folger Shakespeare Library

It is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their
composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems
have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to
make them their own.

Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process
of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings
in language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,
new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a
mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds.
These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource
for study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic
texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The
Folger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a
trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.

The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis
for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their
origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the
single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An
unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and
artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been
consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions
also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of
Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.

I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul
Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s
works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a
richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers
who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow
the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the
Folger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and
digital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I
commend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.

From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare

Library

Until now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly
Folger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of
Shakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the
Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of
the plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that
there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But
Shakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or
plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some
cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published
versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great
collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First
Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of
Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others.
Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then
amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other
versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate
text.

Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an
unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the
period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that
made it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred
years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on
cultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,
for example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda
to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The
Tempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not
take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare
editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her
father, Prospero.

The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long
before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to
make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The
Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger
Shakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly
transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,
which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger
Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial
interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from
Othello: “ If she in chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square
brackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood  and sword and
fire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from

Textual Introduction

By Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine

Hamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier.  Who hath relieved/you?”). At
any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for
more information.

Because the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with
twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger
here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,
and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the
plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study
and enjoyment of Shakespeare.

The events in King John take place in the thirteenth century, well
before Shakespeare’s other English history plays. After the death of
John’s brother, Richard I, John rules England.

John’s young nephew, Arthur, has a claim to the throne and is
supported by the French. At first, a proposed marriage between the
French crown prince and John’s niece, Blanche, calms Anglo-French
tensions. Then the pope, in a dispute over recognizing an archbishop,
excommunicates John and backs Arthur’s claim.

After war erupts, John captures Arthur and orders his death. Arthur’s
guardian, Hubert, prepares to burn out Arthur’s eyes, but then spares
him. Arthur dies leaping from the prison wall. Arthur’s mother
Constance grieves inconsolably.

Meanwhile, French forces reach England. John submits to the pope
to gain his aid. Rebellious English nobles join the French, but return
to John when they learn the French prince plans to kill them. English
forces under the bastard son of Richard I expel the French, but a
monk poisons King John, whose son becomes Henry III.

 With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.

 But many a many foot of land the worse.
 Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
 “Good den, Sir Richard!” “God-a-mercy, fellow!”
 An if his name be George, I’ll call him “Peter,”
 For new-made honor doth forget men’s names;
 ’Tis too respective and too sociable
 For your conversion. Now your traveler,
 He and his toothpick at my Worship’s mess,
 And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
 Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
 My pickèd man of countries: “My dear sir,”
 Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin,
 “I shall beseech you”—that is Question now,
 And then comes Answer like an absey-book:
 “O, sir,” says Answer, “at your best command,
 At your employment, at your service, sir.”
 “No, sir,” says Question, “I, sweet sir, at yours.”
 And so, ere Answer knows what Question would,
 Saving in dialogue of compliment
 And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
 The Pyrenean and the river Po,
 It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
 But this is worshipful society
 And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
 For he is but a bastard to the time
 That doth not smack  of observation,
 And so am I whether I smack or no;
 And not alone in habit and device,
 Exterior form, outward accouterment,
 But from the inward motion to deliver
 Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age’s tooth,
 Which though I will not practice to deceive,

 Madam, I was not old Sir Robert’s son.
 Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
 Upon Good Friday and ne’er broke his fast.

 Could he  get me. Sir Robert could not do it;
 We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,
 To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
 Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.

walk aside and talk.

BASTARD

 Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady

 Blanche?

 Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
 Is the young Dauphin every way complete.
 If not complete of, say he is not she,
 And she again wants nothing, to name want,
 If want it be not that she is not he.
 He is the half part of a blessèd man,
 Left to be finishèd by such as she,
 And she a fair divided excellence,
 Whose fullness of perfection lies in him.
 O, two such silver currents when they join
 Do glorify the banks that bound them in,
 And two such shores to two such streams made one,
 Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
 To these two princes, if you marry them.
 This union shall do more than battery can
 To our fast-closèd gates, for at this match,
 With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
 The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
 And give you entrance. But without this match,
 The sea enragèd is not half so deaf,
 Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
 More free from motion, no, not Death himself
 In mortal fury half so peremptory
 As we to keep this city.

, aside
  
 Here’s a stay

 That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
 Out of his rags! Here’s a large mouth indeed
 That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and

 seas;

 Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
 As maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs.

 He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke, and

 Our ears are cudgeled. Not a word of his
 But buffets better than a fist of France.
 Zounds, I was never so bethumped with words
 Since I first called my brother’s father Dad.

, aside to King John
 

 Son, list to this conjunction; make this match.
 Give with our niece a dowry large enough,
 For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
 Thy now unsured assurance to the crown
 That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
 The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.
 I see a yielding in the looks of France.
 Mark how they whisper. Urge them while their

 souls

 Are capable of this ambition,
 Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
 Of soft petitions, pity, and remorse,
 Cool and congeal again to what it was.

 In such a love so vile a lout as he.

 My uncle’s will in this respect is mine.
 If he see aught in you that makes him like,
 That anything he sees which moves his liking
 I can with ease translate it to my will.
 Or if you will, to speak more properly,
 I will enforce it eas’ly to my love.

 That all I see in you is worthy love,

 Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
 This sway of motion, this Commodity,
 Makes it take head from all indifferency,
 From all direction, purpose, course, intent.
 And this same bias, this Commodity,
 This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
 Clapped on the outward eye of fickle France,
 Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
 From a resolved and honorable war
 To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
 And why rail I on this Commodity?
 But for because he hath not wooed me yet.
 Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
 When his fair angels would salute my palm,
 But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
 Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.
 Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
 And say there is no sin but to be rich;
 And being rich, my virtue then shall be
 To say there is no vice but beggary.

 I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word
 Is but the vain breath of a common man.
 Believe me, I do not believe thee, man.
 I have a king’s oath to the contrary.
 Thou shalt be punished for thus flighting me,
 For I am sick and capable of fears,
 Oppressed with wrongs and therefore full of fears,
 A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,
 A woman naturally born to fears.
 And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,
 With my vexed spirits I cannot take a truce,
 But they will quake and tremble all this day.
 What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
 Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
 What means that hand upon that breast of thine?

 Of Nature’s gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
 And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,
 She is corrupted, changed, and won from thee;
 Sh’ adulterates hourly with thine Uncle John,
 And with her golden hand hath plucked on France
 To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
 And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
 France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
 That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John.—
 Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
 Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
 And leave those woes alone which I alone
 Am bound to underbear.

  
 Pardon me, madam,

 Let kings assemble, for my grief ’s so great
 That no supporter but the huge firm Earth
 Can hold it up. Here I and sorrows sit.

 Pray that their burdens may not fall this day,
 Lest that their hopes prodigiously be crossed.

 No bargains break that are not this day made;
 This day, all things begun come to ill end,
 Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!

 And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
 Within the scorchèd veins of one new-burned.
 It is religion that doth make vows kept,
 But thou hast sworn against religion
 By what thou swear’st against the thing thou

 swear’st,

 And mak’st an oath the surety for thy truth
 Against an oath. The truth thou art unsure
 To swear swears only not to be forsworn,
 Else what a mockery should it be to swear?
 But thou dost swear only to be forsworn,
 And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear.
 Therefore thy later vows against thy first
 Is in thyself rebellion to thyself.
 And better conquest never canst thou make
 Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
 Against these giddy loose suggestions,
 Upon which better part our prayers come in,
 If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
 The peril of our curses light on thee
 So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
 But in despair die under their black weight.

 Will not a calfskin stop that mouth of thine?

  
 Upon thy wedding day?

 Against the blood that thou hast marrièd?

 Clamors of hell, be measures to our pomp?

 But now will canker sorrow eat my bud
 And chase the native beauty from his cheek,
 And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
 As dim and meager as an ague’s fit,
 And so he’ll die; and, rising so again,
 When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
 I shall not know him. Therefore never, never
 Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.

 I will not keep this form upon my head

 If that young Arthur be not gone already,
 Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
 Of all his people shall revolt from him
 And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,
 And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
 Out of the bloody fingers’ ends of John.
 Methinks I see this hurly all on foot;
 And, O, what better matter breeds for you
 Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge
 Is now in England ransacking the Church,
 Offending charity. If but a dozen French
 Were there in arms, they would be as a call
 To train ten thousand English to their side,
 Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
 Anon becomes a mountain. O noble dauphin,
 Go with me to the King. ’Tis wonderful
 What may be wrought out of their discontent,
 Now that their souls are topful of offense.
 For England, go. I will whet on the King.

 Methinks nobody should be sad but I.

 Young gentlemen would be as sad as night
 Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
 So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
 I should be as merry as the day is long.
 And so I would be here but that I doubt
 My uncle practices more harm to me.
 He is afraid of me, and I of him.
 Is it my fault that I was Geoffrey’s son?
 No, indeed, is ’t not. And I would to heaven
 I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.

 And grapple with him ere he come so nigh.

 To underprop this action? Is ’t not I
 That undergo this charge? Who else but I,
 And such as to my claim are liable,
 Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
 Have I not heard these islanders shout out
 “Vive le Roi” as I have banked their towns?
 Have I not here the best cards for the game
 To win this easy match played for a crown?

 Commend me to one Hubert with your king;
 The love of him, and this respect besides,
 For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
 Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
 In lieu whereof, I pray you bear me hence
 From forth the noise and rumor of the field,
 Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
 In peace, and part this body and my soul
 With contemplation and devout desires.

 In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
 When with a volley of our needless shot,
 After such bloody toil, we bid good night
 And wound our tott’ring colors clearly up,
 Last in the field and almost lords of it.

Enter a Messenger.

 What’s that to thee?

  Thou hast a perfect thought.

 I will upon all hazards well believe
 Thou art my friend, that know’st my tongue so well.
 Who art thou?

  
 Who thou wilt. An if thou please,

 Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
 I come one way of the Plantagenets.

 I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
 Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
 And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
 His soul and body to their lasting rest.

 To push destruction and perpetual shame
 Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
 Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
 The Dauphin rages at our very heels.

 And happily may your sweet self put on
 The lineal state and glory of the land,
