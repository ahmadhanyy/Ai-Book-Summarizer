Michael Witmore

Director, Folger Shakespeare Library

It is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their
composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems
have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to
make them their own.

Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process
of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings
in language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,
new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a
mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds.
These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource
for study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic
texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The
Folger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a
trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.

The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis
for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their
origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the
single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An
unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and
artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been
consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions
also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of
Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.

I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul
Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s
works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a
richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers
who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow
the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the
Folger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and
digital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I
commend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.

From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare

Library

Until now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly
Folger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of
Shakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the
Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of
the plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that
there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But
Shakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or
plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some
cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published
versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great
collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First
Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of
Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others.
Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then
amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other
versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate
text.

Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an
unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the
period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that
made it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred
years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on
cultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,
for example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda
to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The
Tempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not
take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare
editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her
father, Prospero.

The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long
before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to
make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The
Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger
Shakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly
transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,
which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger
Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial
interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from
Othello: “ If she in chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square
brackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood  and sword and
fire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from

Textual Introduction

By Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine

Hamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier.  Who hath relieved/you?”). At
any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for
more information.

Because the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with
twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger
here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,
and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the
plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study
and enjoyment of Shakespeare.

In All’s Well That Ends Well, a woman is given in marriage to the
man she longs for, but, because she is of lower rank, he refuses to
accept the marriage. It becomes her challenge to win his acceptance.

Helen, the daughter of a dead physician, secretly loves Bertram, the
Count of Rosillion’s son. When the count dies, Bertram becomes a
ward of the French king, who is dying of a fistula. Helen heals the
ailing king, and he grants her wish to marry his ward. Bertram
refuses to consummate the marriage and goes off to war, sending
Helen a list of seemingly impossible conditions to be met before he
will consider her his wife.

To meet his conditions, Helen substitutes herself for a woman whom
Bertram desires, and sleeps with him. When false news comes that
Helen is dead, Bertram faces the charge that he has killed her. Helen,
now pregnant, reappears, saving Bertram and demonstrating that she
has met his conditions. Bertram then acknowledges her.

Enter young Bertram Count of Rossillion, his mother

  In delivering my son from me, I bury a second

 husband.

  And I in going, madam, weep o’er my

 father’s death anew; but I must attend his Majesty’s
 command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore
 in subjection.

  You shall find of the King a husband, madam;

 you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times
 good must of necessity hold his virtue to you,
 whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted
 rather than lack it where there is such abundance.

  What hope is there of his Majesty’s

 amendment?

  He hath abandoned his physicians, madam,

 under whose practices he hath persecuted time
 with hope, and finds no other advantage in the
 process but only the losing of hope by time.

  This young gentlewoman had a father—O,

 that “had,” how sad a passage ’tis!—whose skill
 was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched
 so far, would have made nature immortal, and
 death should have play for lack of work. Would for

 the King’s sake he were living! I think it would be
 the death of the King’s disease.

  How called you the man you speak of,

 madam?

  He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it

 was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.

  He was excellent indeed, madam. The King

 very lately spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly.
 He was skillful enough to have lived still, if
 knowledge could be set up against mortality.

  What is it, my good lord, the King languishes

 of?

  A fistula, my lord.

  I heard not of it before.

  I would it were not notorious.—Was this gentlewoman

 the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

  His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to

 my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good
 that her education promises. Her dispositions she
 inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an
 unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
 commendations go with pity—they are virtues and
 traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness.
 She derives her honesty and achieves her
 goodness.

  Your commendations, madam, get from her

 tears.

  ’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her

 praise in. The remembrance of her father never
 approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows
 takes all livelihood from her cheek.—No
 more of this, Helena. Go to. No more, lest it be
 rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have—

  I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
  Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,

 excessive grief the enemy to the living.

 In his bright radiance and collateral light
 Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
 Th’ ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
 The hind that would be mated by the lion
 Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague,
 To see him every hour, to sit and draw
 His archèd brows, his hawking eye, his curls
 In our heart’s table—heart too capable
 Of every line and trick of his sweet favor.
 But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy
 Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

Enter Parolles.

 One that goes with him. I love him for his sake,
 And yet I know him a notorious liar,
 Think him a great way fool, solely a coward.
 Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him
 That they take place when virtue’s steely bones
 Looks bleak i’ th’ cold wind. Withal, full oft we see
 Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

  Save you, fair queen.

  And you, monarch.

  No.

  And no.

  Are you meditating on virginity?

  Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let

 me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity.
 How may we barricado it against him?

  Keep him out.

  But he assails, and our virginity, though

 valiant in the defense, yet is weak. Unfold to us
 some warlike resistance.

  There is none. Man setting down before you

 will undermine you and blow you up.

  Bless our poor virginity from underminers and

 blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins
 might blow up men?

  Virginity being blown down, man will

 quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him
 down again, with the breach yourselves made you
 lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth
 of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity
 is rational increase, and there was never
 virgin got  till virginity was first lost. That you
 were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by
 being once lost may be ten times found; by being
 ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion.
 Away with ’t.

  I will stand for ’t a little, though therefore I

 die a virgin.

  There’s little can be said in ’t. ’Tis against the

 rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is
 to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible
 disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin;
 virginity murders itself and should be buried in
 highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate
 offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
 much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very
 paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
 Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
 self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
 canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by
 ’t. Out with ’t! Within ten year it will make itself
 two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal
 itself not much the worse. Away with ’t!

  How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own

 liking?

  Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er

 it likes. ’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
 lying; the longer kept, the less worth. Off with ’t
 while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity,
 like an old courtier, wears her cap out of
 fashion, richly suited but unsuitable, just like the

 Your date is better in your pie and your porridge
 than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old
 virginity, is like one of our French withered pears:
 it looks ill, it eats dryly; marry, ’tis a withered pear.
 It was formerly better, marry, yet ’tis a withered
 pear. Will you anything with it?

  Not my virginity, yet—

 There shall your master have a thousand loves,
 A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
 A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
 A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
 A counselor, a traitress, and a dear;
 His humble ambition, proud humility,
 His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
 His faith, his sweet disaster, with a world
 Of pretty, fond adoptious christendoms
 That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he—
 I know not what he shall. God send him well.

  Such friends are thine enemies, knave.

  You’re shallow, madam, in great friends, for the

 knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary

 kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented

  Madam, I was very late more near her than I

 to herself her own words to her own
 ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touched
 not any stranger sense. Her matter was she loved
 your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that
 had put such difference betwixt their two estates;
 Love no god, that would not extend his might only
 where qualities were level; Dian no  queen of virgins,
 that would suffer her poor knight surprised
 without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.
 This she delivered in the most bitter touch
 of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin exclaim in, which
 I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal,
 sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns
 you something to know it.

  You have discharged this honestly. Keep it

 to yourself. Many likelihoods informed me of this
 before, which hung so tott’ring in the balance that
 I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you
 leave me. Stall this in your bosom, and I thank you
 for your honest care. I will speak with you further

Aside.
 Even so it was with me when I was young.
  If ever we are nature’s, these are ours. This thorn
 Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong.
  Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.
 It is the show and seal of nature’s truth,
 Where love’s strong passion is impressed in youth.
 By our remembrances of days foregone,
 Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
 Her eye is sick on ’t, I observe her now.

 A native slip to us from foreign seeds.

 I love your son.
 My friends were poor but honest; so ’s my love.
 Be not offended, for it hurts not him
 That he is loved of me. I follow him not
 By any token of presumptuous suit,
 Nor would I have him till I do deserve him,
 Yet never know how that desert should be.
 I know I love in vain, strive against hope,
 Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
 I still pour in the waters of my love
 And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
 Religious in mine error, I adore
 The sun that looks upon his worshipper
 But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
 Let not your hate encounter with my love
 For loving where you do; but if yourself,
 Whose agèd honor cites a virtuous youth,
 Did ever in so true a flame of liking
 Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
 Was both herself and Love, O then give pity
 To her whose state is such that cannot choose
 But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
 That seeks not to find that her search implies,
 But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies.

  
 Madam, I had.

  
 Wherefore?

 Tell true.

, standing
 

 I will tell truth, by grace itself I swear.
 You know my father left me some prescriptions
 Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
 And manifest experience had collected
 For general sovereignty; and that he willed me

 Emboweled of their doctrine have left off
 The danger to itself?

 Captain Spurio with  his cicatrice, an emblem of

 there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move
 under the influence of the most received star, and,
 though the devil lead the measure, such are to be

 With sprightly fire and motion, whose simple touch
 Is powerful to araise King Pippen, nay,
 To give great Charlemagne a pen in ’s hand
 And write to her a love line.

  “To the court”? Why, what place make you

 special when you put off that with such contempt?
 “But to the court”?

  Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners,

 he may easily put it off at court. He that cannot
 make a leg, put off ’s cap, kiss his hand, and
 say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap;
 and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were
 not for the court. But, for me, I have an answer
 will serve all men.

  Marry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all

 questions.

  It is like a barber’s chair that fits all buttocks:

 the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock,
 or any buttock.

  Will your answer serve fit to all questions?

  As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,

 as your French crown for your taffety punk, as
 Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a pancake for
 Shrove Tuesday, a morris for May Day, as the nail
 to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding
 quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun’s lip to the
 friar’s mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.

  Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness

 for all questions?

  From below your duke to beneath your constable,

 it will fit any question.

  What, what, sweetheart?
 

 O my Parolles, they have married me!
 I’ll to the Tuscan wars and never bed her.

  France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits

 the tread of a man’s foot. To th’ wars!

  There’s letters from my mother. What th’

 import is I know not yet.

  Ay, that would be known. To th’ wars, my

 boy, to th’ wars!

 He wears his honor in a box unseen
 That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
 Spending his manly marrow in her arms
 Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
 Of Mars’s fiery steed. To other regions!
 France is a stable, we that dwell in ’t jades.
 Therefore, to th’ war!

  My mother greets me kindly. Is she well?

  She is not well, but yet she has her health. She’s

 very merry, but yet she is not well. But, thanks be
 given, she’s very well and wants nothing i’ th’ world,
 but yet she is not well.

  If she be very well, what does she ail that she’s

 not very well?

  Truly, she’s very well indeed, but for two things.

  What two things?

  One, that she’s not in heaven, whither God send

 her quickly; the other, that she’s in Earth, from
 whence God send her quickly.

Enter Parolles.

  Bless you, my fortunate lady.

  I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine

 own good fortunes.

  You had my prayers to lead them on, and to

 keep them on have them still.—O my knave, how
 does my old lady?

  So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I

 would she did as you say.

  Why, I say nothing.

  Marry, you are the wiser man, for many a man’s

 tongue shakes out his master’s undoing. To say
 nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to
 have nothing is to be a great part of your title,
 which is within a very little of nothing.

  Away. Thou ’rt a knave.

  You should have said, sir, “Before a knave,

 thou ’rt a knave”; that’s “Before me, thou ’rt a
 knave.” This had been truth, sir.

  Go to. Thou art a witty fool. I have found

 Madam, my lord will go away tonight;
 A very serious business calls on him.
 The great prerogative and rite of love,
 Which as your due time claims, he does acknowledge
 But puts it off to a compelled restraint,
 Whose want and whose delay is strewed with sweets,
 Which they distill now in the curbèd time
 To make the coming hour o’erflow with joy
 And pleasure drown the brim.

 enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these
 engines of lust are not the things they go under.
 Many a maid hath been seduced by them; and
 the misery is example that so terrible shows in the
 wrack of maidenhood cannot for all that dissuade
 succession, but that they are limed with the twigs
 that threatens them. I hope I need not to advise

  O, for the love of laughter,

 fetch off his drum in any hand.

, to Parolles
  How now, monsieur? This

 drum sticks sorely in your disposition.

  A pox on ’t! Let it go. ’Tis but a drum.

  But a drum! Is ’t but a drum? A drum so

 lost! There was excellent command, to charge in
 with our horse upon our own wings and to rend
 our own soldiers!

  That was not to be blamed in the command

 of the service. It was a disaster of war that
 Caesar himself could not have prevented if he had
 been there to command.

  Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.

 Some dishonor we had in the loss of that
 drum, but it is not to be recovered.

  It might have been recovered.

  It is to be recovered. But that the merit of

 service is seldom attributed to the true and exact

  Why, if you have a stomach, to ’t, monsieur!

 If you think your mystery in stratagem can bring
 this instrument of honor again into his native
 quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go
 on. I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If
 you speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it
 and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,
 even to the utmost syllable of your
 worthiness.

  By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
  But you must not now slumber in it.
  I’ll about it this evening, and I will presently

 pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my
 certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;
 and by midnight look to hear further from me.

  May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are

 gone about it?

  I know not what the success will be, my

 lord, but the attempt I vow.

  I know thou ’rt valiant, and to the possibility

 of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee. Farewell.

  I love not many words. 

  No more than a fish loves water. Is not this

 a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems
 to undertake this business which he knows is not
 to be done, damns himself to do, and dares better
 be damned than to do ’t?

  You do not know him, my lord, as we do.

 Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man’s

 Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
 Resolved  to carry her. Let her in fine consent
 As we’ll direct her how ’tis best to bear it.
 Now his important blood will naught deny
 That she’ll demand. A ring the County wears
 That downward hath succeeded in his house
 From son to son some four or five descents
 Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds
 In most rich choice. Yet, in his idle fire,
 To buy his will it would not seem too dear,
 Howe’er repented after.

  Sir, his wife some two months since fled

 from his house. Her pretense is a pilgrimage to
 Saint Jaques le Grand, which holy undertaking
 with most austere sanctimony she accomplished.
 And, there residing, the tenderness of her nature
 became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan
 of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.

  How is this justified?

  The stronger part of it by her own letters,

 which makes her story true even to the point of her
 death. Her death itself, which could not be her
 office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
 the rector of the place.

  Hath the Count all this intelligence?

  Ay, and the particular confirmations, point

 from point, to the full arming of the verity.

  I am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of

 this.

  How mightily sometimes we make us

 comforts of our losses.

  And how mightily some other times we

 drown our gain in tears. The great dignity that his
 valor hath here acquired for him shall at home be
 encountered with a shame as ample.

  The web of our life is of a mingled yarn,

 good and ill together. Our virtues would be proud
 if our faults whipped them not, and our crimes
 would despair if they were not cherished by our
 virtues.

Enter a Servant.

  I have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses,

 a month’s length apiece. By an abstract of
 success: I have congeed with the Duke, done my
 adieu with his nearest, buried a wife, mourned for
 her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained
 my convoy, and between these main parcels
 of dispatch effected many nicer needs. The last
 was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.

  If the business be of any difficulty, and

 this morning your departure hence, it requires
 haste of your Lordship.

  I mean the business is not ended as fearing

 to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue

  I have told your Lordship already: the

 stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would
 be understood: he weeps like a wench that had
 shed her milk. He hath confessed himself to Morgan,
 whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time
 of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of
 his setting i’ th’ stocks. And what think you he hath

  I know him. He was a botcher’s prentice in

 Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the
 shrieve’s fool with child, a dumb innocent that
 could not say him nay.

, aside to First Lord
  Nay, by your leave, hold

 your hands, though I know his brains are forfeit to
 the next tile that falls.

  Well, is this captain in the Duke of

 Florence’s camp?

  Upon my knowledge he is, and lousy.
, aside to Bertram
  Nay, look not so upon

 me. We shall hear of your Lordship  anon.

  What is his reputation with the Duke?

  The Duke knows him for no other but a

 poor officer of mine, and writ to me this other day
 to turn him out o’ th’ band. I think I have his letter
 in my pocket.

  Marry, we’ll search.

  In good sadness, I do not know. Either it is

 there, or it is upon a file with the Duke’s other letters
 in my tent.

  Here ’tis; here’s a paper. Shall I read it to

 you?

  Dian, the Count’s a fool and full

 of gold—

  That is not the Duke’s letter, sir. That is an

 advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
 Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
 Rossillion, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
 ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again.

  Nay, I’ll read it first, by your favor.

  My meaning in ’t, I protest, was very honest

 in the behalf of the maid, for I knew the young
 count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is
 a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it
 finds.

, aside
  Damnable both-sides rogue!

 When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and
 
 take it.

  After he scores, he never pays the score.
 Half won is match well made. Match, and well
 
 make it.

  He ne’er pays after-debts. Take it before.
 And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:
 Men are to mell with; boys are not to kiss.
 For count of this: the Count’s a fool, I know it,
 Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.

  He shall be whipped through the

  My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid

 to die, but that, my offenses being many, I would
 repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live,
 sir, in a dungeon, i’ th’ stocks, or anywhere, so I
 may live.

  We’ll see what may be done, so you confess

 freely. Therefore once more to this Captain
 Dumaine: you have answered to his reputation
 with the Duke, and to his valor. What is his
 honesty?

  He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister. For

 rapes and ravishments, he parallels Nessus. He
 professes not keeping of oaths. In breaking ’em he
 is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such
 volubility that you would think truth were a fool.
 Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be
 swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm,
 save to his bedclothes about him; but they know
 his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
 little more to say, sir, of his honesty; he has everything
 that an honest man should not have; what an
 honest man should have, he has nothing.

, aside
  I begin to love him for this.

, aside
  For this description of thine honesty?

 A pox upon him! For me, he’s more and more
 a cat.

  What say you to his expertness in war?

  Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English

 tragedians. To belie him I will not, and more
 of his soldiership I know not, except in that country
 he had the honor to be the officer at a place
 there called Mile End, to instruct for the doubling
 of files. I would do the man what honor I can, but
 of this I am not certain.

  What’s his brother, the other Captain

 Dumaine?

  Why does he ask him of me?

  What’s he?

  E’en a crow o’ th’ same nest: not altogether

 so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
 deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward, yet
 his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a
 retreat he outruns any lackey. Marry, in coming on

 When saucy trusting of the cozened thoughts
 Defiles the pitchy night! So lust doth play
 With what it loathes for that which is away.

 Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
 Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
 Which warped the line of every other favor,
 Scorned a fair color or expressed it stol’n,
 Extended or contracted all proportions
 To a most hideous object. Thence it came
 That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
 Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
 The dust that did offend it.

  
 Well excused.

 That thou didst love her strikes some scores away
 From the great compt. But love that comes too late,

 That she would never put it from her finger
 Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
 Where you have never come, or sent it us
 Upon her great disaster.

  
 She never saw it.

 Diana Capilet.

 And she is dead, which nothing but to close
 Her eyes myself could win me to believe
 More than to see this ring.—Take him away.
 My forepast proofs, howe’er the matter fall,
 Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
 Having vainly feared too little. Away with him.
 We’ll sift this matter further.

  
 If you shall prove

 This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
 Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
 Where yet she never was. 

Enter a Gentleman.

  
 Gracious sovereign,

 Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not.

 Here’s a petition from a Florentine
 Who hath for four or five removes come short
 To tender it herself. I undertook it,
 Vanquished thereto by the fair grace and speech
 Of the poor suppliant, who, by this, I know
 Is here attending. Her business looks in her
 With an importing visage, and she told me,
 In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
 Your Highness with herself.

 reads
  Upon his many protestations to marry me

 when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won
 me. Now is the Count Rossillion a widower, his
 vows are forfeited to me and my honor’s paid to him.
 He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow
 him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O king.
 In you it best lies. Otherwise a seducer flourishes,
 and a poor maid is undone.

 If you shall marry,

 You give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine;
 You give away myself, which is known mine,
 For I by vow am so embodied yours
 That she which marries you must marry me,
 Either both or none.

 And was a common gamester to the camp.

 He blushes, and ’tis hit.

 Of six preceding ancestors that gem,
 Conferred by testament to th’ sequent issue,
 Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife.
 That ring’s a thousand proofs.

 Methought you said

 You saw one here in court could witness it.

  
 What of him?

 He’s quoted for a most perfidious slave,
 With all the spots o’ th’ world taxed and debauched,
 Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
 Am I or that or this for what he’ll utter,
 That will speak anything?

  She hath that ring of yours.

  
 I must be patient.

 You that have turned off a first so noble wife
 May justly diet me. I pray you yet—
 Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband—

 Ay, my lord.

  So please your Majesty, my master hath

 been an honorable gentleman. Tricks he hath had
 in him which gentlemen have.

  Come, come, to th’ purpose. Did he love this

  Faith, sir, he did love her, but how?

  How is that?

  He loved her, sir, and loved her not.

  As thou art a knave and no knave. What an

 equivocal companion is this!

  I am a poor man, and at your Majesty’s

 command.

  He’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty

 orator.

  Do you know he promised me marriage?

  Faith, I know more than I’ll speak.

  But wilt thou not speak all thou know’st?

  Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go

 between them, as I said; but more than that he
 loved her, for indeed he was mad for her, and
 talked of Satan and of limbo and of furies and I
 know not what. Yet I was in that credit with them
 at that time, that I knew of their going to bed and
 of other motions, as promising her marriage, and
 things which would derive me ill will to speak of.
 Therefore I will not speak what I know.

  Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst

 say they are married. But thou art too fine in thy
 evidence. Therefore stand aside.
To Diana.
 This ring you say was yours?

  
 Ay, my good lord.

  
 It was not lent me neither.

 The jeweler that owes the ring is sent for,
 And he shall surety me. But for this lord
 Who hath abused me as he knows himself,
 Though yet he never harmed me, here I quit him.
 He knows himself my bed he hath defiled,
 And at that time he got his wife with child.
 Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick.
 So there’s my riddle: one that’s dead is quick.
 And now behold the meaning.

Enter Helen and Widow.

 Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
 Is ’t real that I see?

 The name and not the thing.
