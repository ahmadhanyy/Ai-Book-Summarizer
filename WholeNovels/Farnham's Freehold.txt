CHESS and the GIANT BRAINS 

I n the May 1962 IF a chess-playing 

cro~lputer called "The Machine" 

was the hero of Fritz Leiber's novel-
la The 64-Square Madhouse. 

Rcc~ntly we've learned that at 
about the same time an IBM 7090 
computer at the Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology was program-
med for chess and allotted only two 
hours to demonstrate its skill. (Com-
puter time is costly!) Nevertheless 
"IBM 7090" showed itself a quite 
formidable pla;,:er, especially in com-
plicated middle-game positions, as 
described by Milt Garber, part-time 
chess consultant on the project, in 
the February 1964 Chess Life. 
No connection between the real 

and fictional chess-robots -
which 
makes it interesting to compare their 
performances. 
IBM 7090 thought four moves 
ahead for each player (eight plies 
deep). The Machine: ten plies. 
Both evaluated future positions in 
tenns of strength and development 
of pieces, . control of the center of 
the board, etc. IBM 7090 played 
"point count" chess, with numerical 
values assigned to all of the above. 
Neat touch: the chess king was giv-
en an infinity value, since winning 
the king wins the game. Another 
mathematical refinement: IBM 7090 
used "an alpha-beta heuristic pro-

gram.. to avoid wasting time Oil 
trivial moves. 
IBM 7090 averaged 2.1 m.inutea 

per move. The Machine: 4 minutes. 

IBM 7090 varied th,e time it de-

voted to a move from a few sec-
onds to 8 minutes or more. The 
Machine: ditto. 
The Machine was programmed by 
a grandmaster. Of IBM 7090, Gac-
ber says, "The advice of a grand-
master would have been extremely 
helpful." 

The machine was programmed 
with book openings. IBM 
7090 

wasn't, due to lack of memory 
capacity and of time available for 
writing the program. 
IBM 7090, according to Garber, 

"played well in the opening and 
middle game, but failed badly in 
the end game-simply because it 
had no end game program"-which 
in turn was due once again time-
limitations on program-writing. Al-
most certainly IBM 7090 would have 
wiped up the floor with MANIAC I 
and other earlier computers pro-
grammed for chess. 
By contrast, The Machine tied for 

thiTd in a very strong tournament 
against flesh-and-hlood chess mas-
ters. 

Seems like a reasonable degree of 
correspondence between science fic-
tion and reality!

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told -things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some- but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature's laws-
their amazing discoveries of the hid-
den processes of man's mind, and th1 
mastery of life's problems. Once shroud-

facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri-
vately use them in their homes today.

THE 

SLAVES OF GREE 

BY C. C. MacAPP 

ILLUSTRATED BY MORROW 

He was a warrior slave of the 
mightiest power in space-and 
IJis deadliest foe was himselfl 

I 
J en awoke to a gentle bobbing 

and stared up through clear 
plastic at a dark bluish-gray sky. 
For a moment the color seemed 
frighteningly wrong. Then his mind 
struggled out of the dull confusion 

that mired it. Of course there was 
nothing wrong with the sky. He 
must have been dreaming; in fact, 
shards of the dream still lingered, 
but they were going fast. A name 
whispered itself: Steve Duke. He 
frowned over that. Who was-
Now even the name was gone. 

He was Jen, and there'd been 

aomething about a bump on the 
head, which was probably why he 
couldn't remember how he'd gotten 
here. He was in a treadbag, afloat 
on a mildly choppy sea. The sea was 
dark purple, which was right, and 
the sun coming through the plastic 
was warm. 
He felt the bump on his head. 
Not a bad one. He thought he re-
called that he'd been on a hunt, and 
had fallen off a cliff; but m.1ybe 
that was another dream. The beach 
he could see didn't show any famil-
iar details, so he must have drifted 
far from his hive. 
He sat up and rubbed at a welt 
on his thigh where he'd lain across 
the edge of one of the treadbag's 
metal hubs. He got off the hub and 
looked in its food compartment. 
There were only two cubes of con-
centrate, though he couldn't re-
member eating the rest. He put one 
in his mouth and saved the other. 
He checked the water compartment 
and found it empty. Kneeling on the 
hub, he reached over his head to 
the other hub and found that one 
had neither food nor water. He must 
have been lost several days! But ap-
parently 
he'd 
had 
conscious-
ness enough to eat and drink and 
i<:ttison his wastes. He checked ev-
crvthinl! in each hub. There was 
ve-ry little reserve oxygen, and the 
batteries were low. He'd have to get 
the bag upright and get it to shore. 
He dismissed "Steve Duke" from 
his mind and got to work. 
I t wasn't easy to right a bag 
in active water. This kind of 
treadbag was thin plastic, shaped 

when mflated like a spherical bal-
loon slightly flattened at the sides. 
The tread, simply thickened ribs of 
plastic, was around the long circum-
ference. The diameter across that 
way was a little over seven feet, 
whereas it was only four from hub 
to hub. A bag floated on one side 
or the other. 
He got his 
fingers 
and toes 
hooked in handholds and threw his 
weight to the side. The bag rocked 
but didn't make it upright. He tried 
harder, and this time the bag went 
clear over and he got bumped 
around. On the fifth or sixth try he 
made it, then got the bag spinning 
by trotting up the curve before him, 
like a chipmunk in an exerciser. 
Now the batteries in the hubs would 
begin to charge, and he could re-
cycle air if he had to. When he got 
to the beach he'd look for fresh wa-
ter. 
He watched the shoreline, enjoy-

ing the way it winked and distorted 
as the treads passed before his eyes. 
When he was close he saw tread-
marks on the sand. That !lleant he 
was within rolling distance of a 
hive. He wondered what they'd do 
with a stranger who couldn't even 
remember where he came from. 
A bag came into sight and rolled 
fast down the beach to intercept 
him. It was there ahead of him, be-
cause he couldn't make much speed 
in the water. He made the sign for 
trouble, and the man in the other 
bag acknowledged. Jen saw that he 
was quite old. Other bags were 
gathering now, most of them occu-
pied by humanoids instead of men. 
One species was unfamiliar. 
Jen signaled Confusion, Hunger 

IF 

and Thirst. The old man nodded, 
pointed up the beach, made the 
Hive sign and led the way. 
They turned off the beach onto a 
trail through the spiny grass that 
choked most level land. It seemed 
taller and thicker here than around 
Jen's own hive, and made a harsh· 
er sound against the bag. Ahead, he 
could see nothing but a ridge cov-
ered with ordinary squat blue-green 
trees. It wasn't until they topped 
the ridge that he saw the hive, a 
clear inflated dome a quarter-mile 
'\Cross, with buildings and smaller 
domes inside. The Symbol of Gree 
-
four upright lines and a horizon-
tal one, to represent a humanoid 
hand -loomed large high up on 
the plastic. There were humanoid 
females working the fields around 
the hive, but he saw no human 
women. 
W hen they were half 
a mite 
from 
a 
dome 
a 
sentry-
globe dropped down to hover ahead 
of them and they came to a halt. 
The globe extended a feeler against 
the old man's bag, listened and evi-
dently passed him on, for he left 
with a gesture of politeness to Jen. 
The globe put its feeler against 
Jen's bag · and its flat voice asked, 
"Who are you?" 

"I am Jen, number 377 03 50. I 
do oot remember any more. I was 
floating in the sea." 

"Are you ill?" 
"I don't feel ill. I think I got a 
. bumr en the head." 

The globe said, "The Inquisitor, 

then," and hovered so its weapons 
cou'd b 'ar while Jen rolled to the 
hive entrance. 

THE SlAVES OF GREE 

Another globe took custody in 
the lock and pointed its feeler to 
the 
Inquisitor booth. The door 
opened to admit him, then closed 
behind. In the darkness a deep gen-
tle voice, the voice of all Inquisitor 
booths, said, "What do Gree's loval 
slaves say of him?" 
. 
· 

Jen felt the tightness in the 
throat, the welling of tears, that 
were always the response to that 
question. "Gree is Love," he stam-
mered. "Gree is Beauty. Gree is 
Wisdom and Protection; the Sus-
tainer and -
and the source of 
Comfort. Gree is All." 

"What is the purpose of your exis-

tence?" 

"To -
to obey Gree, and serve 
Him; and repay all I can of His 
Kindness." 

"What is your number, again?" 
"377 03 50." 
"What is your hive?" 
"I do not remember." 
"What is your race?" 
"Human." 
"What is your age?" 
"I do not remember." 
After a short wait, the voice said, 
"Your answers are truthful, J en. 
Your hive is nearly one hundred 
miles from here. You were lost on 
a hunt and have evidently floated 
this far. Your age is twenty-three. 
We will adopt you. Yon may pass, 
Jen." 

Twenty-three, Jen thonght. as he 
rolled from the booth. So young? 
The old man was waiting to lead 
him to the men's barracks. They 
passed small domes where fruits 
were growing or where livestock 
grazed in special atmospheres, and 
turned into a down-ramp near the 
'

center of the dome. There were two 
sets of locks, then they were among 
men. 
Jen tripped the bleeder-valve and 
the bag grew limp. He released the 
seals on both hubs, pulled '.hem free 
of the plastic and set them care-
fully outside. He climbed out, then 
ran his fingers around the beaded 
edges of both holes to make sure 
they were all 
right. He already 
knew, of course, that there were no 
significant scratches on the rest of 
the bag. A man was always on the 
lookout for those. He folded the 
bag and turned it in to Supply, 
along with the hubs which would 
have to be thoroughly tested and 
restocked. 
He turned to the old man. "I am 
Jen. I want to thank you for bring-
ing me in." 

The other nodded. "You'll be 
staying with us, I judge. My name 
is Trav. And this is Roll, and Redo, 
and . . . come, I'll take you to the 
foreman. His name is Bargo." 

II 
Bargo 
was 
a 
husky 
man 
of 
thirty or over, scarred as if 
he'd 
fought 
many contests. 
He 
looked len over. "Twenty-three, eh? 
Well. I can surely use a trained 
hand, and one well put together like 
you. They hardly let me get a nov-
ice out of puberty before they draft 
him. ·There'll be room ~r you on 
the wrestling team, and in the war 
?ames of course, and in two or 
three days I hope to stage a goar 
hunt. Guess that won't be new to 
you, eh?" 

"Uh, no,., len said, embarrassed. 

"My memory's a little out of whack, 
though, you know." The fact was, 
he couldn't remember for sure what 
a goar looked like. 
The had him in the learning ma-
chines for the next two days, check-
ing his education and giving him 
reviews. Then they released him for 
the time, but told him he'd have 
to spend fifteen hours out of each 
hundred in review. The hives all 
had standard curricula, of course-
as did the adolescent s.chools and 
the creches, from which he must 
have come -
but there were a few 
gaps in his recollection. 
Otherwise, things were fine. He 
wrestled, and got to the barracks 
semi-final. Then they spent a day 
inspecting bags and equipment for 
the goar hunt. He was dismayed to 
find he knew little about the hunt-
ing-bags, but he watched and lis-
tened and found they weren't com-
plicated. 
That night he dreamed he was 

afloat again. The waves forced him 
in to shore where a heard of raging 
bovines with terrible horns and fiery 
eyes bellowed and stamped their 
hooves and made little dashes into 
the surf in their eagerness to reach 
him. A very wise creature that he 
could not quite see, because it shift-
ed away when he tried to look at 
it, somehow got in his bag with him 
and told him, "Those may be goar 
and they will tear your bag and let 
the outside air in to suffocate you, 
and if you're not extremely clever 
and agile they'll trample your bag 
to bits, and you too, and gore you. 
But you must not forget for one in-
stant, even if you are dying in the 
most terrible agony, that you are 
IF 

Jen, a loyal and obedient and loving 
slave of Gree. Now I shall go away 
and leave you to face the goar 
alone, because I must not be dis-
covered." And the waves carried 
him in while the herd poured out 
to meet him; and they ripped his 
bag to nothing and he gasped in 
the atmosphere which was heavy 
with carbon dioxide but had little 
oxygen; and he was tossed about on 
the horns, nude and bleeding and in 
shreds; and whenever he fell he was 
pulped by the sharp, terribly heaVy 
hooves. Then Gree, who was some-
times a blaze of light and some-
times more like a tent, came and 
lifted him clear and pushed the 
goar away, and patted him together 
with an adhesive, and put salve on 
his hurts, and patched his treadbag 
and put him in it, and said, "I will 
sustain you because you are Jen, my 
obedient slave." len awoke sobbing. 
T he hunting-bags were of thick-
er plastic than the standard 
model, 
and 
had more 
complex 
hubs, each with an outside grapple. 
Also there were two weapons in 
each hub: a laser that squirted a thin 
beam of light, hot enough to slice 
flesh, and a bullet-port that released 
null-grav pe\lets which travelled in 
a straight line at exactly one thou-
sand feet per second and would det-
onate spontaneously at one thou-
sand feet if they hit nothing sooner. 
Both weapons aimed straight out 
from the middle of the hubs. Jen 
didn't see how anyone could aim 
a bag accurately enough to hit any-
thing more than a few feet away. 
Besides len and Bargo, only four 
others were going on the hunt: Roll 

THE SLAVES OF GREE 

and Redn and two men named Wal-
ter and Skell. About four dozen 
men in their late teens, who were 
going out in standard bags under 
Trav's 
instruction 
for 
simulated 
hunts and contests along the beach, 
enviously watched them go. 
len got into his bag, sealed the 
hubs in place, and inflated to a 
couple of pounds above room pres-
sure. They went througH the locks 
crossed the dome and left by the in-
land exit. The bag was firm out here. 
He noticed thav the others were 
more skillful at treading the bags 
than he was. 
They left the cultivated areas 
and took a rising trail inland, facing 
into the early sun. The trees grew 
thick here, too tall to see over. Bar-
go led them to the top of the near-
est ridge. On the other sid~. farther 
from the sea, the trees grew in 
scattered clumps and there was no 
cut trail. They went north on the 
ridge, staying as high as they could. 
len had trouble with the side-slope, 
but managed. 
After an hour of travel, Bargo 
took a small telescope from a case 
at his waist and gave the valley be-
tween them and the next ridge a 
careful search. Most of it, below 
the tree-line, was thick with spiny 
grass. A stream, lined with trees, 
wound down the middle. 
They rolled down the slope fast, 
dodging clumps of trees, and now 
len really had it hard. When they 
got to the thick grass it was easier, 
because 
it 
slowed 
them. 
Bargo 
found a place where the stream 
crossed and led them over. Present-
ly he pointed at the far slope and 
signalled, "Fresh trail." 

Jen saw a spoor of flattened 

gass, at least ten feet wide, as if a 
large tent had been dragged up the 
alope. Evidently a goar was not a 
bovine after all. 
A fter 
lining 
up 
landmarks, 
Bargo split the party, Jen 
and Holl with himself, Skell leading 
Redn and Walter. They rolled apart 
and started up the ridge parallel to 
the goar's trail, each two hundred 
yards to the side of it. 
The other slope of the ridge was 
rocky for a mile down, but beyond 
that there was rolling country, with 
trees and grass. Bargo searched with 
his glass again, then they went down 
to the grass and looked for signs. 
There were none. The goar evident-
ly had its lair among the rocks 
above them. Bargo nodded and 
turned his glass that way, studying 
the rocks for a long time. Then the 
other three bags joined them and 
they began working up the slope. 
Bargo found a cluster of huge 
rounded boulders he liked, and they 
scouted them oarefully for a base, 
noting where a bag might get 
wedged between rocks or gashed on 
a sharp one, and where the lines of 
retreat were. Then he got them dis-
tributed rather wide apart, each 
handy to cover. Finally he rolled 
on up the slope alone. 
Presently .he stopped and used 
his glass again, then hitched his bag 
arounc;l and fired a bullet which det-
onated a little way short of a great 
crumbling mass of rock. He waited. 
A rock bigger than a man's head 
came arching into sight as if fro.Jil 
a catapult. Bargo avoided that easi-
ly, but a minor avalanche followed 

and he spun down the slope aa 
skidded into cover. The rocks shat-
tered themselves against the protec-
ting boulders. A shard the size of 
Jen's hand grazed his leg, leaving 
a visible mark. Nothing that size, at 
that speed, could pierce the plastic, 
but a bigger chunk might damage 
a hub. 
Something poked into sigh and 

came flowing down the slope like a 
monstrous flattened snake. It was 
easily ten feet wide and thirty long, 
but didn't look more than two feet 
thick anywhere. The front end ta-
pered to a snout from which thrust 
a 
spade-shaped 
horizontally 
flat 
tusk or horn that flashed in the sun 
like glass or quartz. There were 
claws of the same glassy stuff along 
the monster's undulating edges. Jen 
could hear them ring on the rocks. 
Two small eyes winked open · and 
shut. The thing came fast, with de-
ceptive smoothness, over rocks and 
trees. It paused and its tail flipped 
up to send another rock hurtling. 
The rock showered them with frag-
ments, then Bargo whirled into the 
open and let go a bullet which det-
onated very close to the thing. It 
looped itself aside as if stung, but 
no wound showed. It came for Bar-
go now, launching itself in a long 
soaring leap, landing on the boul-
ers with amazing grace. Bargo was 
already gone and spinning down the 
slope toward the others. Bullets and 
laser beams converged on the goar 
as it went by in pursuit of the lead-
er. It contorted and bits of its rub-
bery body flew, but it kept after 
Bargo. He was far down the hill 
now, and still going. The thing 
out after him. 

IJ' 

Jen, mortified that he hadn't even 
fired a bullet, was out with the oth-
ers and headed downhill. He lost 
footing and tumbled wildly in the 
bag, caught himself and fought for 
balance. Bargo had turned around 
a tree-clump and was spinning to 
the side, while the goar tried to 
curve its soar tightly enough to 
catch him. It landed and launched 
off again, laterally to the slope this 
time, and Bargo inst:::ntly turned up-
hill. Now at least the goar didn't 
have altitude on him. Two other 
bags were downhill now, beyond the 
goar, having lost control as Jen had. 
The others were taking pot-shots at 
the goar, but it was by no means 
crippled and it was gaining fast on 
Bargo. Now it was impossible for 
the others to shoot without endan-
gering the leader. Bargo had made 
a stand but his laser beams were 
gone now, the batteries too low. 
Jen was getting close to the spot. 
He could skid to a stop, turn and 
fire, or swerve past the goar to 
safety. Instead, he hurled the bag 
straight at the eager snout. 
The impact was stunning. The 
bag looped in an arc and bounced 
off the goar's back. There was some 
heaving and twisting and flashing 
sights of the ·snout, then it was over. 
He lay in the bag, dazed and bleed-
ing. Bargo appeared and looked at 
him anxiously, then grinned. 
The goar still writhed, but its 
bead was blasted and oozing gray-
green ichor. Bargo said later that 
Jen's attack had given him just time 
enough to put a bullet in the right 
spot. They made jokes about· len's 
being too proud to use bullets or 
lasers on a r,oar. 

TtiE SLAVES OF GREE 

Bruisea were plentiful, but no 
bags were punctured and no one 
had any broken bones. When they 
rested and refreshed themselves, 
they 
began 
to 
hack 
out . the 
goar's snout-blade and some of the 
claws, using the lasers and the grap-
ples. The stuff did seem to be 
quartz, deposited somehow or per-
haps boned and polished by the 
beast. They awarded the snout to 
Jen. Since it was too big to get in 
through a jettison hatch, the honor 
meant be bad to carry it home 
clutched in a grapple. 
E vidently 
Jen's 
awkwardness 
with the bunting bag was not 
noticed, for Bargo made him a sort 
of assistant and sent him out with 
squads of younger men to · teach 
tactics. He did very well. He found 
he could read a war-problem script 
once and comprehend it. Not only 
did he know every tactic and stra-
gem in the manuals, but he invented 
some of his own. 
He easily made up his deficien-
cies in the technical subjects, af!.d 
thereafter attended advanced math 
and phy,sics classes with the other 
mature men. Trav was barracks in-
structor in these, though of course 
the teaching machines did most of 
the actual lecturing. 
Four thousand hours passed. Jen 
was now the second ranking athlete 
in the barracks. Sometimes, when he 
was lucky, be even beat Bargo. 
But when be represented the bar-
racks against others in the hive -
there were currently eight different 
humanoid species in this hive, each 
with its own barracks -
there was 
one individual named Fazzool, a 

B'lant, whom he could never beat. 
It was not because of physical dif-
ferences. The B'lant were about 
the size and shape of men, hairless, 
with tough gray skins adapted to 
some harsh world, but no more mus-
cular than men. However, they came 
close to being infallible in what-
ever they'd once learned. In general, 
they were a little less inventive and a 
little slower thinking than men, but 
Fazzool was an exceptional B'lant 
and there was certainly nothing 
slow or dull about him. The two of 
them had some contests that thrilled 
the hive, but alWays some minor slip 
of Jen's gave Fazzool the victory. 
It was impossible for Jen to resent 
Fazzool, however much one hated 
to lose. Fazzool was modest and 
gracious about his victories. As a 
matter of fact, they became good 
friends. 
A big batch of eighteen-year-

olds came in, and all the old-

er men were busy training them. 
Then one day Jen returned from a 
trip with a bunch of them to find 
Bargo in a glum, bitter mood. 
"That'll be your last trip," the fore-
man said. 
Jen looked at him in surprise. 

"What do you mean?" But the fore-
man only turned and walked away. 
Jen sought out Trav. "What's 

wrong with Bargo? Have I done 
something wrong?" 

"Did he snap at you?" 
"No, but he'd hardly talk to me. 
And he said-" 

"He's always that way when 
there's a draft." 

"A draft!" Jen stared at the old 

man. "You mean I'm going?" 

"Everyone of eligible age is go. 

ing. All over the hive." 

Jen whooped and seized the old 
man and danced him around. "I'm 
drafted! I'm going to Space! I'll-
I'll be a warrior, and hunt the Bird 
of Effogus! I'll-" 

When he calmed down he saidt 

"I'm sorry Bargo is taking it the way 
he is. He'll get along without me; 
he did before." 

"It isn't that," Trav said, straight-

Ding his tunic and trying to look 
severe. He met Jen's eyes. "Didn't 
it ever occur to you what it's like 
to be passed over?" 

That sobered Jen. After a min-

ute he said, "I- no. I didn't think 
a man like Bargo ... " 

Trav gave him a sardonic smile. 

"What do you suppose· he'd doing 
here at his age? Did you ever hear 
of anyone coming back to a hive 
world?" 

"Well no. But how could a man 
like Bargo be passed over?" 

"I don't know. Any more than I 
know why I was passed over forty 
years ago."

• Attention. 
the following men will line up 
in numerical order immediatelv at 
the med booth. Skell, number· 376

Redn, number ... " 

Always before, the man in front 
of J en had come back out of the 
med booth. This time he didn't, and 
Jen went in a little nervously. The 
door closed behind him and he 

IP' 

squeezed his eyes shut against the 
usual sprays. Blasts of warm air 
left him itching. A voice said, "What 
is that bruise on your left thigh?" 

"I fell in a treadbag, while I was. 
showing novices a maneuver." 
A metal tentacle came from the 
wall and put its mouthlike tip 
against the bruise. There was a tiny 
needleprick and the 
voice 
said, 

"That'll fix it. Take a deep breath, 
now." The tentacle came up to lis-
ten to his heart. 
When the pricks and thumpings 
and mouth-sprays-to-gargle 
were 

over, 
a 
panel 
opened 
in 
the 
back of the booth, where he'ci nev-
er suspected one, and he stepped 
through. He was in an unfamiliar 
corridor. He walked along it to a 
turn, and saw humanoids ahead of 
him. Farther on he saw Skell walk-
ing. A humanoid stepped from a 
side-passage just ahead of him and 
they both stopped, startled. 
The line gradually filled in, and 
when it came to a stand there "ere 
about two humanoids between him 
and Skell. Ahead of Skell, a B'lant 
stepped out of line and came back. 
Jen recognized Fazzool, "Zo," the 
leathery humanoid said, falling in 
beside him. "We draft togezzer! 
Maybe we big heros and see much 
sport, and many strange zings., 

Jen laughed. That pretty much 
expressed his own feelings. "Mayl-e 
I can wrestle the Bird of Effogus," 
he said, "Even if I can't wrestle 
with you." 

The com said, "Quiet in line, 
please. You'll be moving in a mo-
ment. You're about to meet your 
Overseer." 

THE SLAVES OF GREE 

Jen had seen members of tho 

Overseer race, but not close 

up. This one stood on a low plat-
form in a large auditorium and ad-
dressed 
them. 
He spoke 
B'lant 
rather than English, since there 
were more B'lant present than hu-
mans. (All hunanoids had to learn 
those two languages.) He told them 
he'd be their commander all through 
Advanced School, until .they were 
requisitioned to Fleets or other ser-
vice and were full-fledged warriors 
of Gree. He looked almost human, 
except for the extremely wide-set 

~yes and broad short nose, and he 
smiled at them in a .friendly way. 
He wore a one-piece coverall with 
the Symbol of Gree worked onto 
the left breast. He carried a laser 
pistol in a holster at his belt. 

"There) one formality w~ have 
to take care of," he told them at 
the last. "I must mark you with my 
personal ideograph. It will be your 
identification and safeguard in case 
you get lost, until you nave a dif-
ferent commander, when it will be 
changed. I'll also put your numbers 
on you now. I don't have to do that 
here and now, but we have time, 
and it gives me a chance to know 
each of you individually." 
They had to file past htm one 
at a time, while he implanted his 
mark and their numbers on their 
hips. It was done invisibly, by a sty-
lus that left tiny magnetic particles 
in the skin that could only be read 
with the proper instrument. It itched 
for a while. 
Jen noticed that whenever they 
were lined up, the men and the 
B'lant always came first. Also, they 

got preferential seating. The other 
humanoids did not seem to mind. 
As soon as the marking was fin-
ished they were fed, then marched 
to a tunnel-train that bore them on 
monotonously for two hours. Then 
they transferred to what could only 
be a spaceship. 
J en found 
his 
first 
sight of 
space disappointing. It was too 
much like the training films; and of 
course he'd been in the gray cham-
ber many times so free-fall was no 
novelty. Most of the others seemed 
to enjoy it more. 
Their destination must have been 
many light-years from the hive 
world, for they nulled out three 
times, spacing in twice for correc-
tions any maybe as evasive action in 
case enemy ship detected them. Then 
the third time they were within 
easy telescope range of the Ad-
vanced School. 
It was a collection of spheres 
and cylinders, some connected by 
what looked like threads from here, 
some in slow orbit around the cen-
tral group. Lights, indistinguishable 
from stars except by relative mo-
tion, crawled here and there. Every 
globe or cylinder had at least two 
ports lit up, and some were spang-
led with lights. The whole thing 
looked like an elaborate toy. 
Now, as .first indoctrination in 
actual space, each draftee had to 
leave .the ship in a spacebag and 
get himself over to the School. Jen 
got in the de-pressure chamber and 
took deep breaths and exercises to 
speed adjustment. He pulled his 
suit's limp helmet over his head and 

sealed it, but didn't inflate. It would 
inflate when be got in the bag, which 
would only be at four pounds. The 
other draftees in the chamber with 
him all looked soared. 

The spacebag was of clear plas-

tic no thicker than that of a huntin& 
model treadbag, but this bag was 
was elongated from bub to hub 
rather than flattened. Slirong cords 
ran from three points equidistant 
around the rim of each hub to cor-
responding points on the other. 
There was room between the three 
ropes to position oneself comfort-
ably, but he found that the problem 
was to avoid pulling on one and 
deforming the bag when he didn't 
want to. Tilting the hubs naturally 
tilted the grav drive and affected 
his aim. Now at last he was react-
ing to Space. He had to fight panic 
for a few seconds as he skewed off 
course, then overcorrected and got 
the bag into a very confusing end-
for-end tumble. He forced himself to 
relax and consider the problem. 
He was in no real trouble; at worst 
he'd pass within a short distance of 
the cylinder he had to attain. Ahead 
of him he could see bags in even 
worse spins, and one drifting out at 
a sharp angle. The occupant of that 
one was curled up in a tight ball, 
arms wrapped around his head. A 
light was moving out from the 
School to make the rescue; but that 
was one who'd obviously flunked the 
test. 
He found he could judge his own 
drift even though the ship, the sta-
tion and the stars were wheeling 
around him. The first thing to do 
was get his spin around the hub-to-

ll' 

hub axis. He gave the rotor jets of 
one hub a gentle blast. The result, 
as the bag twisted and several ~ p!ns 
fought, was disturbing, but he wait-
ed it out and eventually things sta-
bilized. Now he had a precessing 
wobble, not too fast to follow if he 
concentrated hard. He chose what 
he felt were the right side-jets and 
touched them lightly. After anoth-
er period of distortion, the bag set-
tled to a lateral spin with a small 
wobble. He let that go and concen-
trated on his course. A few careful 
spurts got his long axis lined up and 
a little over-corrected, which was 
what·· he needed. Now a mild grav 
thrust brought him on course, or 
near enough. But he was overtak-
ing bags ahead. He retroed a little 
and got his speed about right. He 
was feeling proud of himself now, 

THE SlAVES OF GREE 

and worked at his wobble until it 
was almost entirely gone; then he 
killed most of the lateral spin and 
went drifting to the cylinder very 
neatly. 

Larger bags, rigid and double-
manned, were darting about res-
cuing people. Jen passed Redn very 
close, and saw the strain on the 
other man's face. A moment later 
one of the heavy bags eased into 
Redn's path and absorbed some of 
his momentum. Then they came 
over to look at Jen, gave him a pair 
of grins, and left him. He wanted 
very much to hit the net at the cy-
linder without any help. He made 
small corrections and got some 
wobble again, but ignored it. He 
was on course. 
He hit near the edge of the net 
and it took up the shock. He worked 

furiously with a grapple and got it 
hooked around a strand. He re-
laxed, perspiring. Then he saw an-
other bag coming straight at the 
net, faster than he had. At the last 
moment it checked and drifted in 
neatly with very little wobble. It 
touched almost the exact center of 
the net and a grapple caught on 
casually. Jen felt his face grow 
warmer as he met Fazzool's grin. 
T he 
ship 
that 
had 
brought 
them stood by for ten hours. At 
the end of that time it left, taking 
with it those who'd flunked the 
transfer · plus 
four 
others 
who 
couldn't seem to adjust to steady 
weightlessness, 
despite 
their 
pre-

viously passing in the grav tanks. 
There'd be service for them, and 
maybe even combat, but not in 
space. Holl was one of them. 
Now the class settled into a rou-

tine of hard work. They were learn-
ing not only how to apply in actual 
Space the physics and math they 
knew, but aho the maintenance and 
operation o( a staggering array of 
equipment. All of it was fascinating, 
though, and most of it came easier 
to Jen than to some of the others. 
Skell, who'd been so good up to 
now, flunked out on blunders, along 
with a few humanoids. The Over-
seer was a fiend in his insistence on 
detail and perfection, and some-
times when they got in from a long 
drill he'd take them to do it over. 
When they weren't out on those 
they had to spend long hours at ex-
ercise, usually in a cylinder of com-
paratively 
small 
circumference 
around which they ran as hard as 

they 
could to simulate gravity, 
barked at by instructors, until they 
were exhausted. 
Some grumbled. 

but Jen didn't. He wanted to keep 
his strength, and also to be able to 
eat what he liked and digest it after-
ward. 
After nearly eight hundred hours, 
the Overseer decided they'd earned 
a 
twenty-hour vacation. 
A ship 
whisked them through null to a rec-
reation world, where they staged an 
orgy that made the .Overseer shake 
his head and say he'd never quite 
seen their match for pure debauch-
ery. 
That was the time Fazzool, by 
pulling a quick swap in the dark, 
maneuvered Jen into a rather inti-
mate position with a B'lant woman, 
and an especially leathery one at 
that. It was rather a horrible shock, 
but everyone had a lot of fun out of 
it and it made Jen a minor legend 
at the School. 
Except for the rare vacations, the 
only days of relaxation were when 
they had free-fall wrestling or team 
games of tie-up, in a spherical gym-
nasium where it was necessary to 

thi~k and move in three dimensions. 
The tie-up game was simple, so far 
as rules went: ten men on each side 
endeavored to tie up their oppon-
ents with short length of rope. An 
amazing amount of strategy deve-
loped, with Jen and Fazzool quick-
ly becoming the two best team lead-
ers in the class. Here, as every-
where, humans and B'lant seemed 
naturally to lead, other humanoids 
to follow. 
When they'd become 
good at the game, the Overseer 
made Jen and Fazzool co-leaders of 

IF 

a class team and sent them into 
competition against other classes. 
They did very well together. 
T he eight thousand hours of 
Advanced School were nearly 
past, and now there was one ulti-
mate test everyone must face. He 
must find his way home in a space-
bag, from where a ship dropped 
him. It would take him about one 
hundred hours, and he had no ra-
dio and no directions except what 
he knew of the local stars and 
what he could learn from a star-
chart and some instruments. There 
was alleged to be enough food, wa-
ter, air and energy to keep him 
alive and bring him home -
if used 
just right-and very little more. 
Jen watched the ship pull away, 
then wink into null. The first thing 
to do, he told himself, was to relax 
and think about the problem. 
By exercising just enough to keep 
his circulation and digestion mov-
ing, and eating barely enough to 
avoid starving, he'd be sure of the 
food and air. There was a special 
problem about the air- he could 
use some of it for jetting, and thus 
save battery power from the grav 
drive. But if he wasted too much 
compressed air, he'd have to recycle 
the bag's, and that used energy. 

One thing he could not afford to 
do was drift away from the School, 
or propel himself even a few degrees 
in the wrong direction. Therefore, 
he couldn't waste too much time 
thinking before he located himself. 
First of all he had to determine 
the bag's spin very accurately, so 
be could correct for it. That was 

THE SLAVES OF GREE 

simple in theory, but tedious. He 
fixed the figures in the computer. 
Next he used the small telescope 
to find all the variable or muttiple 
stars of any brightness, and com-
pared his list with the star chart. 
He got no definite clues, but did 
eliminate some possibilities. He'd 
have to look for more subtle things. 
There'd be some hint- the angle 
of a short-orbit binary, · or some-
thing. 
Finally the computer nudged up 
an answer with a probability of bet-
ter than three to one. Dare he act 
on that? The one chance in three of 
being wrong depended on ~he close-
ness of his readings, and on me-
chanical error. He decided !o wait 
a little longer. 
Two hours later he re-.:hecked, 

found no change, and made some 
quick mental calculations. The posi-
tion he suspected would fit with his 
being presently about ninety hours 
from the station, with the accelera-
tion he planned. He stared in the 
indicated direction. The stars were 
cold and unfamiliar. If he were 
wrong, would they find him? There 
had been losses out of most groups, 
so they said. Gree was only a mor-
tal after all, and not infallible; and 
neither were his Overseers. And 
even if they rescued 
him -
he 
could assure that by just going no-
where- he did not" want to survive 
and flunk. 
He had no better information 
that what the computer offered so 
far. He made up the programming 
and used the grav drive. 1f he 
wound up with extra air he could 
always use it for jets later. 

Once he was com:nit:ed. though, 

he worried about his decision. If he 
used too much battery energy, the 
extra air wouldn't do him any good. 
He needed the batteries to keep the 
bag warm. 

Baro..ly fifteen hours had passed. 

4 t thirty 
hours 
he 
was 
sure 

i~ he was getting closer to the 
Sc!lWJI. but it looked as if he had 
enough error to pass it ~,ut of tele-
scope range. Now he faced decision 
again. Pondering it only made his 
nerves worse, so he 
ca!l:ula~d as 
close as he could and made the cor-
rections with compressed air. Then 
he did his exercises and 
a~e. and 
forced himself to relax; hut llnwel-
come thoughts kept coming. Did 
Gree really worry about individual 
slaves? Suppose it were accepted 
that a certain number should die in 
training? Many died in c.Jmbat. 

And thinking of combat, what if 
the enemy happened to space in 
here? Glory 
was 
fine, 
but 
he 
didn't want to die meanly in a· bag 
without any weapons. 
At fifty hours he reached some 

kind of an emotional crisis· and had 
to face the real question: citner he 
could keep a grip on himself or he 
couldn't. Put that way, it was a lit-
de easier. He simply 
mu~rered all 
his courage to face the threat. But 
relaxing was harder than violent 
action would have been. And now 
something else was getting out of 
kilter. At times he could remember 
the creche and almost all his young-
er life; then those memories would 
lhift to a different angle so they 
seemed second-hand as if he'd only 

watched them in a movie, and some 
of them would elude him entirely. 
He endured grimly, clinging to hill 
identity as Jen, who belonged to 
Gree. 
But at somewhere around seven-

ty-five hours- he wasn't paying 
enough attention to the rime now, 
nor bothering to eat or exercise -
his skull seemed to get crowded. 
Hot dizziness swept over bim. He 
heard his voice cry :>ut distantly, 
"No!" 

Then the tide rolled over him. 

IV 

T here seemed to be a bird in 
the bag with Steve. It was the 
size of a condor, or larger, but it had 
a head and face that were both el-
fin-like and man-like, and a pair of 
small but strong-looking hands and 
arms. "Steve," it said to him m a 
dry whisper of a voice. "Major 
Steve Duke. Come up." 

He shook himself awake. He 
looked at the creature and said a 
four-letter word. "How'd you get 
here?'' 

"I'm not real. Your own mind is 
conjuring me up. We arranged it 
that way, hut for technical reasons 
we couldn't tell you." 

He reached out a hand suddenly, 
found he could grasp nothing. "Hell! 
You look real. Solid." 

"Pull yourself together," the whis-

per said, "You're in danger. len's 
personality is beginning to waver." 

Steve scowled. "Good riddance, 
if you ask me. I feel all right. What 
now?" 

"Review. 
Question-and-answer. 

IF 

At least we can make sure your 
personality stays firm." 

Steve swore again. "I don't need 
that childish stuff. I know who I 
am." 

"Don't be too sure. You need me, 
as - an exterior personality- even 
an artificial one -
to focus on. It's 
the only way we can keep things 
in the right relationship. All right 
now, who are you?" 

Steve sighed. He'd been over this 
so often. "Steve Duke. Major, Free 
Earth Counter Force." 

"What am /?" 
Steve grinned. "Bird of Effogus. 
And you'd better not let me get you 
on a gun-screen while I'm working 
for Gree; because let me tell you, 
I'm a-" 

"What is Gree?" 
"A son of a -
oh, all right. In-

vader. Tyrant. We're going to set-
tle his hash as soon as I find out 
for you how to get at him." 

"I wish we had your confidence 
of that. Why did we choose you?" 

"Because I was a dual personal-
ity, and you could feed into the sub-
merged one the memories of a cap-
tured Gree slave." 

"You're reciting by rote," the 
Bird accused. "Do you really feel 
what you're saying?" 

"Yes, dainn it! I tell you every-

thing is all right!" 

"It isn't all right," the Bird said, 

"Jen's beginning to float a little." 

"He'll make it," Steve said. "He 

does all right. He fools the Inquisi-
tors. And he's got guts. Or we've 
got guts; or however it is." Steve 
realized his attitude toward Jen was 
ambivalent. On the one hand he felt 
-

THE SlAVES OF GREE 

a little contemptuous; on the other 
he often found himself rooting for 
Ien. It was as he thought he might 
feel toward a kid brother, if he had 
a kid brother. He said, more con-
scientiously, "Things are all right. I 
have all of his impressions and mem· 
ories. He has none of mine. As Ion& 
as that's true his environment will 
tend to correct any drift, won't it?" 

"Yes," the Bird said, "so long 
as he doesn't go completely 
off when he's alone. Now, I detect 
something ugly squirming around 
in that cesspool mind of yours. Let's 
have it up and look at it." 

"All right," Steve said with a rush 
of willingness, "It's this. Concede 
that Gree is trying to conquer the 
galaxy, or a hefty piece of it. What 
about you? If we help you stop 
him, maybe you'll just take over 
yourself. And as long as you want 
frankness ... they say Gree is hu-
manoid, at least. I'd just as soon be 
a slave to a humanoid as to a God 
damned bird. Rather." 

"Thank you. Let's go over it 
point by point. How long has Gree 
had Earth?" 

"Damn you," Steve muttered, 

"You've sure got me twisted up in-
side. Arguing with myself ... Six 
hundred years, according to you. 
All right. You showed me evidence." 

"And what was Earth six hundred 
years ago?" 

"Occupied 
the 
Solar 
System. 

About to get to the stars." 

"What is Earth now?" 
"A hive planet. A breeding and 
training pen." 

"And how were you raised?" 

"Free," Steve admitted unwilling-

IJ, "knowing the truth . ..'' 

"Where?" 
"On a planet you gave us." 
"Correct. Now, about our beina 

birds." 

"I suppose I have to believe the 

evidence," Steve said, "You were 
humanoid once. You mutated your-
self for wings and gave up a lot of 
your material science. Still, that 
doesn't ... " 

"Which 
brings us to a point. 
How long, according to evidence 
you'll admit to believing, have we 
been capable of conquering a hefty 
piece of the galaxy, as you put it?" 

"Well ... half 
a 
million 
years, 

maybe." 

"And we didn't?" 
"No." 
"Then doesn't your attitude seem 
foolish?" 

"I suppose so." 
"And now shall I tell you why 
you have such a suspicion?" 

"I don't give a fig whether you 
tell me or not. Whether I tell 
myself, is what I actually mean." 

"It's because you're just naturally 
a sour, disagreeable slob." 

"You picked me for the job." 
"Yes. Which brings us back to 
where we started. You'd better go 
back under now." 

Steve concentrated hard on the 
key phrase, remembering how it 
sounded in an Inquisitor booth: 
"What ~o Gree's loyal slaves ... " 
J en 
awoke 
sobbing. 
He must 

have been dreaming of Gree 
again. 
He 
checked 
the chronometer. 

Nearly eighty hours gone. He must 
have slept quite a while; he felt re-
freshed and a little more serene. 
He had only to endure now; endure 
and keep himself fit. The others 
would be having it just as hard. 
He took care of his needs and 
checked course again, as nearly u 
he knew it. Hours passed. Finally 
he thought he saw a fuzzy spot of 
light that revolved in a small circle 
around his fore-and-aft axis. He put 
the scope on it and trembled with 
excitement. He'd done 
i&! 
There 
was only a small correction to make 

· now; and since he didn't want to be 
in too much below a hundred hours, 
he 
rctroed 
a 
little. 
There wu 

enough charge in the batteries to 
keep him warm. and a little com-
pressed air to jet with. 
He made a good net landing and 
got through the lock, and got him-
self out of the bag. He was stiff and 
lame, and his intestines felt stuffed 
up. The Overseer hurried to him, 
beaming, and hustled him through 
an Inquisitor booth. On the other 
side, the Overseer told him, "The 
best performance I've seen in a long 
time, Jen! A shower now, eh? Then 
maybe something alcoholic?" 

"I guess so, sir." len's voice was 

very hoarse. "The others ... ?" 

"A very good record. Over half 
in already, and only two under 
ninety-five hours, which is passing. 
The rest should all make it without 
help except six. They'll flunk, I'm 
afraid; but that's a low number; 
and we won't lose one." 

"Fazzool?" 
"About an hour away, and in fine 

,Shape. When we get you all in and 

IF 

doctored up, there'll be vacation. 
Forty hours this time!" 

v 
A fter the vacation- during which 
.Ten managed to sneak carbor-
undum crystals into Fazzool's bed 
-
there was a short period of re-

view and examinations. Then one 
waking-cycle the corns blared, "The 
following report to Overseer's of-
fice at once. Jen, number 337 03 50. 
Fazzoo!, number . . ." 

The Overseer was already empty-
ing his desk. He told them, "The 
twenty highest scores in the class 
are going to a Fleet Base. You will 
be the only B'lant and the only hu-
man in the group, and you'll be 
jointly in charge until you report in. 
The other eighteen are being ad-
vanced one grade. You are both be-
ing advanced two. You will find the 
assignment inspiring; and if you 
maintain the same level of dili-
gence, the way is open for you to 
go high in the service of Gree." 
He came around tbe desk to shake 
hands. "I've enjoyed working with 
you, and with the class in general. 
I hope my next one will be as 
good." 

The trip must have been long, for 
they made four jumps of it, but fi-
nally they spaced in within sight of 
the Base. 
This was a breathtakingly thick 
starfield, but the Base was even 
more awesome. A long chain of 
Stations, each bigger than the whole 
of the School they'd left, swung in 
distant orbit around a huge red star. 
Farther in, a swarm of collector-

THE SLAVES OF GREE 

depots soaked up energy and trans-
formed it for beaming out to the 
Stations. Freighters darted between 
Stations like bees, or popped out of 
null with mysterious cargoes from 
ten thousand exotic worlds. 
len's transport was dropping to-

ward one of the stations, while he 
and the others crowded before a 
screen. The station's · image bal-
looned until it filled .the screen, and 
now Jen saw the fighting ships 
nursed up to it in perfect ranks, like 
piglets dwarfed against the belly of 
a monstrous sow. The transport re-
troed; a huge port filled the screen. 
A screeching and shivering of metal, 
a bell and a green light, and they 
were sealed on. 
The draft filed from the trans-

port and lined up before an Inquis-
itor booth. Other groups, totaling 
hundreds of draftees, were being 
processed through. And this was 
only one Station of the Base! 
Jen reacted to the key question 
and sobbed out his answers in the 
booth, then he was through it, hand-
ing his taped orders to an Over-
seer. "Get your group to med first," 
he told Jen and Fazzool, "then come 
back here. You two double-graden 
-
Jen and Fazzool, is it? -are 
assigned to a crew at once." 
T hey saw no 
more of their 
classmates when they'd gone 
through med. An overseer -
their 
new commander- put his 
ideo-

graph on them after erasing the old 
one, and took them via shuttle-car 
across the great cylinder of the Sta-
tion to the sunward side, where they 
went aboard his ship. 

This was only a Scout, with a 
crew of twenty plus the skipper. 
Actually, there were two crews; the 
second one, under another Overseer 
who was Second-in-command, being 
off duty now. 
The duty crew 
bunked in the Station handy to the 
ship. 
Jen and Fazzool had been made 
familiar with this standard class of 
Scout at school. She had three sec-
tions, squat cylinders coupled end-
to-end by standard locks, the two 
outer ones being the only ways in 
and out of the ship. One was 
coupled to the Station when she was 
home, and left open. 
The middle section was the living 
quarters, and there they bunked 
when they were on duty. The two 
end sections had duplicate power-
generators and fighting equipment, 
so that either could carry on by it-
self in a pinch. She had her own 
mess and was proud of it, and the 
food was the best Jen had ever eat-
en. The discipline was not harsh, 
though no one loafed. Everyone was 
concerned with keeping the Scout 
shipshape, and that was it. 
Jen was disappointed at first that 
he and Fazzool hadn't gotten a 
capital ship, but his feeling changed 
fast. The Scout was his ship now. 
Still, he loved to sign out a bag dur-

in~ free hours and go outside to look 
at the big ships. They were five-sec-
tional, each section a vastly wide but 
flat cylinder, with great missile ports 
and laser-beam openings into which 
he could have floated his bag. The 
ships were so big, in fact, that a 
standard Scout coupled onto the 
end lock as a tiny lifeboat. 

There were so many things to do 
in free time that none of them ever 
need grow stale. There were fur-
loughs to vacation worlds, space 
tours to fascinating planets, films, 
exhibitions, athletic contests. For 
that matter, the Scout's missions 
were fascinating. They'd null, and 
space in, twenty or thirty times per 
trip; each time hanging dark and 
with all power damped for a few 
minutes, listening, since there was 
always the chance, however small in 
the vastness of the galaxy, of stum-
bling upon the enemy. But if things 
were quiet they'd take photographs 
and instrument readings, or perhaps 
orbit an interesting planet. A few 
times they actually landed. Once 
they were so long that at their 
check-in point they found a drone 
awaiting them, a standard Scout, 
unmanned and programmed just to 
hop here and back. They squirted 
it a message and it vanished into 
null to go home and report they 
were all right. 
But on the Scout's nineteenth or 
twentieth mission, one of their hops 
dumped them right into the midst of 
a battle. 

VI 
A hom bellowed. The Second in 
command who was in len's 
end 
of 
the ship, 
leaped 
for 
his battle-seat and strapped in with 
his left hand while his right hov-
ered 
over 
a 
button. 
Crewmen 
poured 
from 
the 
middle-section 
lock. When they stopped coming 
the Second dropped his fist on tho 
button and the lock slammed shut. 

U' 

Screens were asquirm now with 
green blips -
friendly ships -
and, 
at the edges, a glob of yellow ones 
which were the enemy. Short red 
lines, crawling like worms, were the 
enemy missiles. They'd obviously 
gotten a jump on the friendly fleet. 
Jen and Fazzool were in their 
seats and strapped down. They had 
the defensive armament for this end 
of the ship; small counter-missiles 
and one laser beam. The screen 
went blank, then came on again 
with all the blips shifted, which 
meant the Scout had nulled out and 
spaced in again some miles away. 
That puzzled Jen for a second, then 
he realized she was locked into 
Fleet Command and was moving 
with the other ships. The red worms 
on the screen wheeled and came on 
again. It would be fifteen minutes 
or more until enough energy accu-
mulated to null again. The screen 
began to blink white with detona-
tions as the interception began. It 
was impossible to follow as the au-
tomatics went to work, missiles and 
counter-missiles, with their built-in 
computers and tactical sense, ma-
neuvering at a hundred times hu-
man speed. The Scout shuddered 
and clanged as debris and expand-
ing gases hit her. 

She lurched hard, twice, and Jen 
understood she'd been shifted to 
guard some important ship. A big 
blip on the main screen, very near 
the center, would be the one. A 
circle glowed for an instant around 
that blip, then was gone. The Com-
mand Ship herself! He darted a 
glance at the Second and saw the 
Overseer's face taut, his shoulders 

THE SLAVES OF GREE 

slightly hunched, as if expecting to 
be martyred any instant. The rain 
of debris on the hull was deafen-
ing now. Other Scouts were clus-
tered around, their combined auto-
matics intercepting most of what 
came by, headed for the Command 
Ship. 
T hen a heavy salvo. showed on 
the screen, the big stuff, sur-

rounded by its swarm of protective 
smaller missiles. The Scout jumped 
again and the salvo leaped across 
the screen. She'd been put right in 
the path! And the salvo was coming 
fast -
far too fast. 
Barring miracles, it would sweep 
aside the Scouts, Jen's included, like 
so many gnats and go on to atomize 
the Command Ship. The idea of 
death pervaded Jen's mind but it 
was an impersonal thing, unimpor-
tant now. If he could just make a 
hole in that protection around the 
main enemy salvo. Crack it; dent 
it; so Gree's missiles could get in! 
His fingers began to dance over his 
keyboard. Nearly everything in this 
end of the Scout went blasting away 
in a compact group, pitifully small, 
but for that very reason not like:y 
to attract much attention. He let it 
go straight on collision. course for 
the hostile salvo. At the right in-
stant he'd maneuver. But soon -
his control would only last until the 
enemy jamming got strong. Nowl 
He sent his missiles blossoming out 
like a flower, away from each other 
as if to attack from many angles. 
He built up a small concentration 
in the path of the salvo. But the in-
stants flew so fast, and brain and 

fingers were so slow. He was aware 
of Fazzool beside him, letting Jen 
handle this while he, the B'lant, 
atrove with the laser beam to fight 
off death from the Scout for just 
brief seconds, just enough time for 
Jen to do whatever he was doing. 
Now! Jen pulled his ludicrously 
overmatched missiles back into a 
tight group, shooting in at full ac-
celeration toward the tiny flaw in 
the defense 
where 
missiles 
had 
pulled out to meet his feint. The 
screen 
blinked 
with 
explosions. 
Then a great blinding flare! He'd 
gotten something! And there was a 
hole, if only for a second. Were 
there friendly missiles close enough 
to exploit it? But the fight was on 
top of the Scout now. She bucked 
and screamed as steel tore into her 
and great detonations made brief 
Jigantic winds in Space. There was 
a jar so immense Jen's straps dug 
into his body until he thought they'd 
tear him apart. The screens went 
blind-white, then black. All the 
lights went out. Then they came on 
again as circuit-breakers cut back 
in. 
The salvo was past, and there was 
only one more great flaring on the 
screens, that lasted for many sec-
onds and centered somewhere near 
the Command Ship. Then it was in-
credibly still, with only a faint 
thump now and then of slow-mov-
ing debris against the hull. The 
screens ·showed a few distant flares 
as unimportant missiles went off. 
The enemy fleet had vanished from 
the screens. Nulled out, probably, 
and with wisdom, for more of 
Gree's fleets would be on the way. 

The Overseer, his face drained 
and wooden, was unstrapping. He 
paused and listened as overseer 
language gobbled from the com. He 
translated, "A reconnaissance in 
force, we think. They won't be 
back." He glanced at the screen, 
where the big blip, close in, still 
glowed. The Command Ship's still 
alive, more or less, and we'll get the 
credit 
for that. But I'm afraid our 
other two sections are dead." He 
looked at Jen for a few .moments. 
I don't like to demand it after the 
way you've just fought, but some-
one has to go outside .and inspect 
damage. Two." 

Jen looked 
at Fazzool, 
who 
grinned. Jen said, "We're both pret-
ty good in bags, sir, and we've 
worked together a lot." 
The Second smiled faintly. 
"I know. I've got enough power to 
null if we have to, but the field 
would only extend a few yards; so 
stay very close to the hull. I think, 
though, we'll be here a while." 
J en inflected the bag to a little 
above 
ship's 
pressure, 
then 
sealed his suit and raised the suit 
pressure a fraction of a pound. Faz-
zool wasn't quite ready, so he pro-
pelled himself toward the lock and a 
humanoid opened it for him. 

Outside, he got a grapple on a 
handhold and looked around while 
he waited for Fazzool. This was a 
dense starfield, so there was light 
enough to see even the dark ships 
and the holes in them. There'd evi-
dently been about twenty capital 
ships in this fleet, and somewhat 
more of the enemy. 

IJ' 

The Command Ship only lived 
nominally; one section out of the 
five. Auxiliaries and bags clustered 
around it, at work already making 
rescues 
and 
emergency 
repairs. 
Drones winked in and out of exis-
tence. Those would be carrying 
battle reports to Central Command, 
wherever that might be. A few of 
them might even be reporting to 
Gree himself. Wherever he was. 
That last thought made Jen's blood 
pound. He sent a little cool air into 
his helmet, but it didn't help. The 
crowded dizziness grew. Alarmed, 
he looked to make sure his grapple 
was tight. Then he blacked out. 
Steve shot a glance at the tell-
-
tale light and saw the lock was 

pumping down. Fazzool would be 
put in seconds. He stared around at 

THf SLA YES OF GREE 

the fleet, noting things Jen would 
have ignored. It was the drones that 
had brought him to the surface, he 
knew -
some planted command to 

surface when he saw a possible way 
to Gre~. Could he stow away on 
one? Not likely; they'd be moni-
tored inside as well as out. 
The lock opened and he put on 
what he hoped was a natural smile. 
They propelled their bags along 

the end and around to the cylindri-
cal side. The middle compartment 
was holed in several places and 
completely 
dark. 
Two 
crewmen 
should have been on duty there. 
Fazzool maneuvered 
his bag to 
throw a light-beam in and they saw 
the two bodies. 
They went to the far sectiOn, 

where the skipper bad been. It was 
in even worse shape, with great 

jagged holes. Steve studied one and 
decided they could get the bags in. 
He went in first, and aimed his light 
for Fazzool. It came to him that it 
would be very easy to shove the 
B'lant's bag against the jagged steel 
and rip it. But Fazzool would still 
be in a suit. And what was the prof-
it just now? 
There was nobody alive in the 
section. The skipper had died in his 
battle-seat. There was no power. 
Steve wished he were alone. There 
were some things he'd have loved 
tq give more attention. 
They checked what they had to 
and went back outside. At the live 
end Steve lagged a little and let 
Fazzool reach the lock first. He 
wanted a few more minutes outside 
to look around and think. 
The drones still came and went. 
The only way he'd get into one was 
with clearance from an Overseer. 
He stiffened. Maybe he could ar-

range that. 
He glanced at the tell-tale light. 
He'd have a few minutes before 
they began to wonder, inside. He 
shot back around the hull into the 
jagged hole. He hesitated, wonder-
ing if he could work out of a bag. 
But the suit would stiffen with the 
big pressure differential. .. He pro-
pelled over to the dead skipper and 
wedged his bag between a seat and 
the bulkhead so his grapple was po-
sitioned about right. In some com• 
partment of the skipper's panel 
would be what he wanted. 
He got one compartment open. 
Food. He tore at others, finally 
found the magnetic marker. He 
maneuvered it to the bag's jettison 

lock and inside. He floated, pum-
meling his mind for a plan. They 
must be getting worried about him 
by now. 
A note to Jen from the Skipper! 

But there was no time to write it 
now. He got more compartment 
open, found a pencil and notepad, 
got them into the bag. Now if be 
could arrange for the rest of the 
Scout to die ... 
He stared at the pow~r unit. No 
way to set off fuel without killing 
himself 
too. 
A 
missile? 
There 
were still a few left in this end. But 
how would he set it off, with enough 
delay to let him get clear? It would 
be easy enough to position it so it 
would streak through tlte middle 
section and blast the bulkhead be. 
yond. Could he rig some radio con~ 
trol to fire it? Not in less than 
hours. But there must be a way. 
All he had to do was set off the 
driving charge. 
The skipper's laser gun! 
H e went back to the corpse, 
tore at the holster and got the 
gun, then went for a missile. He 
didn't take the biggest. No use ad• 
vertising to the whole fleet; a small 
penetration would do. There was 
a hole in the bulkhead he could put 
it in, but he needed something to 
jam it in with. A corpse ... He •got 
one and stuffed it into the hole, 
pushed the missile in alongside. The 
gun fit nicely in a pocket of the 
corpse's suit so it wouldn't float 
away. He aimed it at the missile's 
casing, in what he hoped was the 
right spot, and set it for low power 
and steady operation. When he 

If' 

triggered it the casing 
be~; .. :: to 

glew at once. Scared now, he pro-
pelled out of the hole and shot away 
from the Scout. He turned in time 
to see the masked flare. Vapor and 
debris puffed out. There were no 
lights left that he could see. He let 
out his breath and relaxed for a 
moment, grinning like an adoles-
cent. Then he took a grip on him-
self. Not time yet to be feeling so 
damned clever. 
He wrote in pencil, trying to im-

itate the dead skipper's writing, in 
English, "Jen: you are unconscious 
as I write, but you are not wound-
ed and you will live if we get you 
into a bag. The rest of us won't. 
You are marked with a very im-
portant message. Take this note 
without delay to the Overseer in 
command of the fleet. Give it to 
no one else and do not let anyone 
examine you. These are your orders. 
Good luck" Then he faked the skip-
per's ideograph. 
Now he took the magnetic mark-

er and added more, in the Overseer 
script. Slaves weren't supposed to 
know that, but the bird of Effogus 
had taught him many things. Final-
ly he unsealed his suit and prepared 
to mark the message on himself. He 
hesitated. Dare he do it this way? 
It would prove' that the suit had 
been unsealed. and in breathable 
air, when the message was implant-
ed. He couldn't think of anything 
better. He put the message on his 
stomach, describing a new type of 
enemy missile. If he wrote the script 
awkwardly, that was as a dying 
Overseer might write. And if they 
wanted any confirmation about the 
enemy missile, the battle had al-

THE SLAVES OF GREE 

ready supplied it. He happened to 
know that there had been an inno-
vation used. He hoped the informa-
tion was expendable. 
He suited up, then jettisoned the 
pencil, notepad and marker, nudg-
ing them with the bag so they'd 
float away. Now there was one more 
thing to do before putting himseH 
under and letting Jen carry the ball 
for a while. He must injure 'himself 
slightly, to make things plausible. A 
bump on the head? Banal; and he'd 
already used that once. He grinned. 
Simple enough -
a 
bloody 
nose 
would look like pressure trouble or 
concussion. He brought the heel of 
his hand against the front of the 
helmet, hard. When he tasted blood 
he exhaled through his nose to spat-
ter the inside of the helmet. Then he 
relaxed and thought hard about 
Gree, and asked himself the key 
question. 

VII 
J en came to with the taste of 
blood in his mouth and a trickle 
of it in his nose. He was in a suit 
and a bag, which agreed with what 
he remembered last- starting out-
side with Fazzool. What had hap-
pened? And where had the note 
come from that was gummed to the 
hub before his face? He read it. Evi-
dently the other sections of the 
Scout had not been dead; the note 
was from the skipper. He turned to 
peer at the Scout. She looked dead 
now. 
Grief welled up in him. Was 
Fazzool dead then, along with the 
rest? They'd given Jen this chance 
to live. Maybe Fazzool himself, 

with his last strength, had sealed the 
bag and pushed it into the lock. 
No matter how badly he felt, he 
must carry out the skipper's orders. 
He propelled himself toward the 
Command ship. He reached for the 
radio controls, then hesitated. Best 
not to transmit. Instead, he used 
the bag's light to signal. 
As he approached a sentry-giobe 
intercepted him and listened to his 
story. It called an Overseer who 
tried hard to convince him that the 
Fleet Commander was far too busy 
to listen to second-grader slaves. 
Jen was humble but persistent. Fi-
nally the Overseer took him to the 
ship's Second, who read the ROte 
and phoned the Commander. They 
were told to take Jen in. 
It was good to be out of the bag 
and the suit. They gave him a damp 
cloth to wipe his face with, and a 
drink of stimulant, after he told 
them he didn't need a medico. Then 
they put him through an Inquisitor 
booth. 
The Commander asked, "Did you 
see this written?" 

"No, sir." 
"Come. We'll put it under a 

marker." 

They found the invisible writing, 
then asked him, "Do you know 
where it's implanted?" 
He rubbed his middle. "It itches 

here." 

When they'd read it, the Com-

mander said, "Do you know what 
this implant's about?" 

"No, sir." 
"What was your battle station?" 
"Counter-missiles, sir." 
The Overseer's eyebrows went 

up. "Did ,you plan that little pene-
tration and execute it?" 

"Yes." 
The other looked at him for ~ 

long time, then said, "I think it will 
be a good idea to send you along 
to Central Command, message and 
all. It's something they'll want to 
study, and your recollections of trye 
battle will be very heiP.ful." He 
motioned to an aide to take care of 
the details. 

·The drone they put him in was 
a standard Scout, with the liv-

ing comfort mostly replaced by 
automatic 
equipment, 
but 
with 
space for two or three passengers. 
He was alone. 
Central Command, which they 
reached in three hops, looked more 
like some small outpose on a prim-
itive world. Actually, the Command 
was in orbiting ships, ready to IWll 
out at the first hint of trouble. They 
sent the drone away and put Jen 
through an Inquisitor bomh which 
asked him an unusual number of 
questions. Finally they shuttled him 
to a different ship and read the 
message implanted in his skin. 
An Overseer took charge of him, 
erased the old ideograph and sub-
stituted a new one, and said they'd 
probably send him back to his Base 
as soon as a drone could be spared. 
He also said Jen would doubtless be 
decorated and 
advanced another 
grade for his part in the battle. 
They gave him a temporary bunk 
in a barracks with a few other odds 
and ends of slaves. 
After he'd had only a few hours 

sleep they called him back to bia 

IP' 

new Overseer's office again. As he 
floated in, a B'lant already rhere 
turned and grinned at him. Fazzool! 
Jen gaped, then launched himself 
forward with a cry. But at that in-
stant the familiar hot dizziness rose 
up in him ... 

Steve surfaced in panic. He em-

braced Fazzool, using that to hide 
his face for a few seconds until he 
could get control of himself. Then 
he drew back arid said, "You're 
alive! How ... ?" 

Fazzool, grinning like a child, 
said, "I zot you dead too! When ze 
final blast come, you still outside, 
or in ze lock-" 

· "I -
in the lock, I think," Steve 

said, trying to make his dismay look 
like something else. If Fazzool had 
a clear recollection, his story would 
damn Steve's- or len's -like a 
spotlight. "But you -but there was 
the note-" 

"I was halfway out ze bag," Paz-

zoo! said. 
"I remember zat. Ze 
shock stun me When I come to ze 
ozzers all dead, but my suit not 
punctured. Zen I go outside to look 
for you, and when zere no sign I 
go to big ship for help, because I 
zpt you drifting even if not dead." 

The Overseer said, "In a suit, he 
went. He had no bag." 

Fazzool grinned. "T am real care-

ful, and it not far enough to freeze 
zrough my tough skin." 

"Well." the Overseer said, "you 

two have had your reunion. And I 
have a very pleasant piece of news 
for you. Being the heroes of the bat-
tle, and having vital recollections of 
it, you're going to have an audience 
with Gree himself." 

THE SLAVES OF GREE 

·They went in -a drone, with-
out any way to see out of it, 
in two hops. Steve managed to skirt 
around the precarious conversation-
al points. It was very fortunate for 
him that they hadn't given Fazzool 
a transcript of Jen's story. But that 
good luck was only temporary, of 
course. The Bird came and hov· 
ered at the edge of his mind tr.r a 
minute, whispering, Cart!/ul,. Keep 
your head. 
Easy to say. 
The drone bumped -2own some· 

where and a com said, "Suit up and 
inflate to seven pounds." 

By the time the lock opene,f the 
drone was down to less than seven 
pounds, so the suits were mildly 
rigid. Steve took a few pulls of oxy-
gen so he'd be alert. But they went 
from the drone into a sealed sur· 
face vehicle of some kind and rolled 
away under low gravity. Tentative-
ly, he decided this was a small, air· 
less planet. Far from any visible in· 
stallations, probably, and guarded at 
a distance rather than close in, and 
with only a few drones visiting it. 
And probably only one of many to 
which Gree could retreat, if the 
slightest threat appeared. 
They travelled for fifteen minutes 
or so and coupled on somewhere, 
and they were let out into a large 
lock of about the same pressure and 
told to unsuit. The air was oxygen-
rich. An Overseer led them silently 
to an Inquisitor booth. Steve had no 
choice but to submerge. 

"Gree is All ... " 
len left the booth and stood a 
moment while the emotion subsid-
ed. It didn't all leave. He was so 

full of joy that his breath kept catch-
ing. Fazzool had survived the bat-
tle after all, and they were both 
about to see the Master! And after 
that there was no imagining the ad-
ventures and glories that awaited 
them. He glanced at the Overseer. 
The Overseer wore a reverent look 
too. 
Fazzool 
emerged, 
Wipmg 
his 
eyes, and they followed the Overseer 
around a turn and into a wide hall 
with a low ceiling and a single 
plain door at its other end. The 
Symbol of Gree, in massive metal, 
blocked the door. From behind it 
came six humanoids and an Over-
seer, walking silently, faces full of 
glory. 
Jen's own escort led them for-

ward. 
The room beyond was dim, but 
at one end lights glowed upon a tall 
figure standing on a low platform. 
Jen could not lift his eyes to it. 
His feet carried him mechanically 
upon a thick dark rug. Three chairs 
stood ready, as if they'd just been 
placed. But when he reached them, 
instead of sitting he threw himself 
down and buried his face in the rug. 
He felt Fazzool land beside him, 
sobbing as he was. The quiet sweet 
music rose a little in volume. 
The gentle voice he'd known all 
his life said, "Arise, my children.'' 
Then, the Inquisitor was Gree him-
self! Someh"ow that made Jen inex-
pressibly happy, as if loneliness and 
disco.ntent were impossble forever. 
A foul thought nudged at his mind: 
How could Gree be so many places 
at once? He thrusted it 
away, 
ashamed. 
Gree or booths 
pro-

grammed to ask and to listen like 
Gree; it did not matter. He pushed 
himself upright but still hung his 
head. The voice said, "Be glad. Look 
at me." 

Jen's tears stopped and he looked 
up. 
Gree was 
certainly humanoid, 
if one could elevate the word, 
He was tall; taller than Jen or 
Fazzool or the Overseer by. perhaps 
a foot. His shoulders were broad, 
his build supple and young. But the 
gray strands in his curly black hair 
and beard showed his maturity. He 
wore a suit of dark material which 
almost certainly had precious metals 
woven into it. At his throat a jabot 
of the purest white cloth set off he 
short-cropped beard and his olive 
skin. The face was just sufficiently 
marked with care. The eyebrows 
pulled down at the middle, but 
arched . up and tilted at the outer 
ends almost mischievously. 1 he eyes 
were very long and narrow, with 
full lashes and long folds of skin at 
the inner corners. The irise-s were 
very light gray and had black ver-
tical slits for pupils that looked into 
one's soul for the slightest 8hadow 
of unworthiness. Jen shuddered and 
was glad he bore no flaws. 
The nose, delicate at the bridge. 

swel!ed to a very broad base, a 
trifle uptilted so it showed large 
nostrils. There was a curl of mus-
tache above the wide, full-lipped 
mouth. The mouth seemed both 
stern and faintly smiling at the same 
time. The skin drew in tautly un-
der sharp cheekbones, to a gaunt 
jaw that was square and outthrust 

II' 

under the beard. On the head, set 
hair like two tree-trunks, were two 
horns, straight, an inch thick and 
five inches long, with blunt knobby 
ends. They were intricately carved 
and inset with gems, and they held 
len's eyes in fascination. 
Gree was frightening. Gree was 
reassuring. He stirred memories of 
the creche-father; and other mem-
ories vaguer but just as fond. He 
made Jen want to serve him for-
ever; to rush out and batter down 
all his enemies. 
The lips parted. "I have listened 
to the accounts of the battle you 
were in, and one of my reas1ms for 
bringing you here was to honor 
your heroism. There is another rea-
son. The Bird of Effogus used some 
new device or tactic, and we must 
learn of it at once. So far, your 
recollection have not been com-
plete." 

Jen felt 
a 
new stir of fear 
and was ashamed of it. 
The voice went on, Apparently 
each of you was un.::o:-~scious for a 
time, but in diff.::rent parts of the 
ship." 

Now Jen's fear was like a siren. 
He felt the bot dizziness again. 

VII 

Steve averted his eyes so any 
change in them wouldn't show. 
He knew he was very close to death 
now, but fear was thin before a 
mightier urge which an abstract 
part of his mind recognized as a 
planted command. It trembled in 
every vein and muscle. and seemed 
almost to shout aloud: "Kill! Killl" 

THE SLAVES OF GREE 

He edged to the right close to the 

Overseer, as if overcome with emo-
tion; half-turned and put his left 
hand on the officer's arm. At the 
same instant he contrived to push 
a chair against the Overseer's thigh 
or a diversion. Deftly, he got hia 
fingers on the Overseer's holster; 
masking 
the 
moment 
with 
his 
own body. He managed to press the 
release-button without putting pres-
sure against the Overseer's thigh. 
The gun slipped out easily. 
The Overseer spoke to him reas-

suringly, and he nodded and drew 
clear. Gree was watching with a pa-
tient expression. Steve jerked the 
the gun up and fired straight at the 
wide eyes. The beam raked ugly 
raw welts across the face and left a 
bubbling where the eyes had b~en. 
A laser beam shot out from some-
where in the abdomen, but Steve 
had already leaped behind the Over-
seer, who took it in the chest. He 
screamed and sagged, but Steve 
gave him a squirt in the kidneys to 
make sure. Then he raked Gree 
across the middle. 
The tall form, horrible to look at 
now, stood unswaying, and Steve 
knew suddenly that it was not na-
turally alive. He whirled toward 
Fazzool. They both stood motion-
less for one frozen instant while he 
read the beginning of comprehen-
sion, and of other things, in the 
B'lant's face. 
He _had 
the 
gun 
aimed at that face, but some com-
pulsion made him lower it to the 
chest instead. He could hear and 
see the tough skin sizzle where the 
beam hit. Fazzool jerked double, 
fell, and lay still. Steve dropped the 

gun as if it had suddenly grown 
white-hot, then, furious at himself, 
picked it up and whirled toward 
Gree. He was in time to see the big 
body split to the waist and fall, 
limply. Where the spine might have 
been, what looked like a yard of 
thick metal cable hung in mid-air, 
contorting. A beam flashed from it, 
but blindly. Steve raked it until his 
own gun went dead. It fell to the 
floor and lay twisting. 
Doors slammed shut somewhere. 
If lie guessed right, no one, not 
even Overseers, would be permitted 
to see -that the Master had fallen. 
More than likely, there were other 
Grees. Maybe there was a whole 
race of the cable-things. 
He glanced at Fazzool's inert 
body. Maybe," he snarled unstead-
ily, "you'll stay dead this time!" 

A panel was opening at the rear 
of the room, and the metal thing on 
the floor writhed toward it. It was 
trying to escape to somewhere. And 
that meant a possible avenue for 
Steve! 
H e ran for the opening, then 
stopped suddenly. The cable 
thing might be insurance of a sort. 
There might be circuits tuned to it, 
that would pass it, but not a man. 
It showed no sign of being aware 
of him now, nor of anything but its 
own agony and need to escape. He 
grabbed the cloth from around the 
neck 
of 
the 
Gree-body, 
which 
moved slowly with some demi-life 
of its own, and used the cloth to 
insulate his hand from the cable-
thing. He picked it up. It was more 
than an inch thick, with a grainy 

surface, patterned differently at dif. 
ferent spots. Could an intelligence 
be programmed into a length of 
metal? No doubt. Especially if i& 
were not homogeneous, but differ· 
entiated into a million tiny cells. It 
felt solid. It hung writhing from his 
hand, like a metal snake, as he 
plunged into the darkness. The pan-
el closed behind them. 
He was in what looked like an 
artificial cave. The only light came 
from fifty yards 
away where a 

Scout was parked. Above it was a 
gantry-work, apparently to open a 
door of some kind. He dashed for 
the Scout and thrust himself into the 
open lock. The thing in his hand 
gave off sparks and a.rasping sound, 
and a smell of ozone, as it scraped 
against the steel. The lock slammed 
behind them. 
They nulled without waiting to 
get clear of the cave. He grinned. 
If circuits watched, he'd look like a 
rescuer. 
There was no one in the drone 
to challenge him. And now he had 
precious minutes, out here in some 
unmarked wilderness of Space, be-
fore they could null again! 
He shoved himself toward the 
computers, from which the standard 
keyboards had been removed. No 
telling how the cable-thing con-
trolled them. He thumbed fasteners, 
got the panel off and stared at the 
circuits inside. The wiring was fa-
miliar, and by shorting certain leads 
he could simulate the pressing of 
keys. But where would he go? Arzry-
where but where the Scout was pro-
grammed to go! At least he could 
gain time. 

He made the short-circuits that 
gave him an override on the pro-
gramming. 

A set of co-ordinates came into 

his mind and he acted on them. He 
was ready minutes before the accu-
mulators had charge enough to null. 
He waited, 
half expecting some 
creature to crawl out of some-
where and ray him down; or the 
drone itself to come to life. The ca-
ble-thing had subsided to a slow un-
dulating. 

They nulled, and he relaxed a lit-

tle. He wasn't near any stars. But 
why had he chosen this spot? No 
doubt from a command planted in 
his mind. 

That turned out to be the case. 

The com clicked and rattled and 
said in a familiar whisper, "We're 
coming in, Major Duke." 

Two of the Birds he already 

knew. The other had so much rank 
even Steve was awed. That one said, 
looking at the cable-thing, "Do you 
know what you've got here, Major?" 

Steve 
shrugged. 
"It controlled 
what passed for Gree. Or one Gree." 

"It's one of the Invaders. And with 
what we can read out of it, we can 
find a Jot more. If we can get mov-

ing before they realize it's missing." 
T he war would take 
a long 
time still, even though the sur-

prise attacks had gotten many of 
the cable-things. There were still 
thousands of die-hard fighting ships, 
and the Overseer race, and an em-
pire. 

Steve was back in the fighting as 

soon as he got tired of posing 
around in public. They gave him a 
Scout group; ships almost as good 
as the Gree Scouts. 
But even after his brilliant per-

formance when it came to the 
preparations for the re-taking of 
Earth -
the original Earth -
they 

wouldn't give him a higher com-
mand. 
He 
resented 
that, 
but 
didn't 

brood about it. He was seeing ac-
tion. And between missions he had 
all he could eat or drink or wear 
or take to bed. 
He wished, 
though, that they 

could do something about the oth-
er personality. Though they assured 
him Jen could never surface again 
unless Steve willed it, Jen was still 
there somewhere. And sometimes 
he was partly awake.

IF • Short Stor~ 

A AS IN ANDROID 

BY FRANCES T. HALL 

He awaited the entrance 
of his executioner-and 
found, 
instead, . himself/ 

Before I saw his face, I thought 
the man was Loyalty Monitor 
Hartch, my executioner. He had got 
in while I was looking out the win-
dow. Should I call it a life now and 
jump out, or wait for Hartch to in-
cinerate me? The Loyalty police had 
a neat, clean way of doing it these 
days, leaving scarcely an ash. And 
my blaster was in a desk half way 
across the room. 
My usual place of business had 
seemed the best place to hide. If 
Smithson had not talked, my pres-
ence here was only to be expected; 
if he had, here was the last place 
they'd look. 'Oh, they'd be here-
Monitor Hartch was as thorough as 
he was corrupt- but last, not first. 
Had I been less bemused I'd have 
heard him coming and pressed the 
stud in my pocket that would acti-
vate the sonic nerve-disruptor. I 

had rigged the doorway with it 
against a day like this. A man in my 
position couldn't be too careful. I 
was on the manufacturing end of 
some of the Loyalty Police's gad-
gets. I don't mean their walky-talkies, 
but the unspeakable things they 
carry in their gray gladstones. (The 
things a man lets himself be sucked 
into, to disarm suspicion and prove 

~is cooperativeness, while he looks 
for a place to plant the shiv in the 
whole system!) 
But I had the disadvantage of a 
stern 
neo-Calvinistic 
upbringing. 
That was an anti-survival factor that 
had already cost us some of the 
best man of our sect -
one of which 
I had proved I was not. The man 
in the mirror just couldn't stomach 
all this, and he saw to it that I 
couldn't, either. 
When things moved too slowly 

the cooperative way, I had involved 
myself in a humanitarian, if belated 
plot to relieve Earth of Our Beloved 
Leader's services -
and life. 
Stupid? Of course it was. But one 
is forced into stupid things from 
time to time to appease the man in 
the mirror. Now one of my co-plot-
ters had been picked up. It was a 
risk we had all taken, but that didn't 
make things any easier. now. Smith-
son was a good man, but when In-
terrogation happens it's just a ques-
tion of time. Even had I sprung my 
little trap when the man came in, it 
would have given me only a few 
minutes' headway- with no place 
to head for. 
Even now I didn't see the man's 
face because I was starring at his 
gray gladstone. Executioner Hartch 
was also an interrogator, then. The 
bag would contain equipment to ex-
tract from me any names and other 
information that the unlucky Smith-
son might have missed. I edged 
closer to the blaster in the drawer 
as the man spoke. 

"It's been a long time, Fornay." 
This would not be Hartch's gam-

bit. And the voice . . . I looked up 
-
and the bottom of my stomach 
dropped out, because he was the 
man in the mirror! 
No, not quite. But-my visitor's 
face was my face! 
Y ounger by a decade and more-
but my face. Numbly, I won-

dered that they would send such a 
person. I sat down, forgetting the 
blaster. 

"It puzzles me," I said cautious-
ly, "that my duplicate should be 

A AS IN ANDROID 

chosen for this job." It puzzled me, 
in fact, that there was a duplicate. 
Humanics 
was 
meticulous 
about 
such things. 
But it looked as though Our Be-

loved Leader's Loyalty Police had 
taken them and their pattern-files 
over, too, by now. And 0. B. L.'s 
boys would be less fussy than Hum-
anics about waiting for a man to 
die 
before 
making his 
andirod-
duplicate. 

Yet what purpose could be served 
now by this? 
The android himself looked puz-

zled as his eyes followed mine. Then 
he let me have it and it hit me like 
a thunder-bolt. 

"I'm in from Cauldron and I'm 
going back within the hour. I'm glad 
I didn't miss you, Ben." 

Blankly, I looked at him again. 
Lean and keen and browned in a 
whiter sun than Sol. And a certain 
look in his eyes . . . Yes. I knew 
now who he was. Worse, I knew 
why he was here. 

"You're the pattern I sold to that 
damned recruiter from Cauldron a 
long time ago." 

He nodded. "I wondered if you'd 
remember. Tell me, Ben, just when 
did you decide to sell the pattern 
you made on your twenty-first birth-
day?" 

Trouble never comes singly. I 
wasn't in enough of a spot for my 
part in the plot against 0. B. L. 
This android had to return now from 
that godforsaken hellhole fifty light-
years away to collect for his indig-
nities. 
Before, I'd been about ready to 
call it quits. This android's presence 

made everything different, I don't 
know why. What I wanted now was 
to knock him flat, then get out of 
this room -
and farther -
and nev-
er have to look at him again. I must 
have got up. 

"Sit down, Ben Fornay. Let's 

talk." 

His voice packed plenty of auth-
ority and he looked well able to en-
force his command physically. I sat. 
"I -
uhs -
sold that pattern five 
years later, when I was twenty-six." 

"What'd you use the money for, 

Ben?" 

The truth sounded incredible to 
me even as I spoke it. "To further 
Our Beloved Leader's career. In a 
small way, I helped' put him where 
he is." I hadn't known then it would 
be like this. 

"Well, they cooked me up ten 
years after they go! hold of our -
of your pattern. You're forty-five 
now, Ben, and I'm thirty -
in phys-

ical age, that is, if you don't count 
what Cauldron's done to me. Con-
sidering the shortage of ex-Human-
ics personnel on Cauldron, I guess I 
was lucky that they got around to 
me as soon as they did. Did you 
ever wonder about me?" 

"Thought you were dead." 
"Sorry to disappoint you. Ben, 
do you know what it's like to wake 
up without warning on a strange 
planet?" · 

"I can imagine, uh- ?" 

1'Martin. John Martin." 
"Martin, I've had nightmares." 
"Have you, now?" John Martin's 
eyes raked the well appointed room. 
"Changes have been made while I 
was away. I've been wondering just 

If 

where you stand in all this. But I 
know now. You're doing business 
with the Loyalty Police, right?" 
F or an instant I had an impulse 
to tell him the whole story. 
Not that he could help me, only it 
curdled me that my other self should 
think I'd gone along easily after I 
learned the score. But the sarcasm 
in his voice cut home. A wave of 
hatred for him shook me. And yet 
. . . and yet . . . he was me! Can 
any man really hate l'limself? 

"I'd rather hunt with the hounds 
than run with the hares," I said at 
last. "I joined them -
Or at least 
I did business with them." 

"I've wondered how you were 
bettering yourself all these years 
I've been on Cauldron. Let me tell 
you what it's like out there, Ben. 
When you first wake up you're in 
a different room and you wonder 
why they moved you. Then you 
notice everything, including 
your 
arm, seems heavier and drops faster. 
After a while the man comes to tell 
you that you're not Ben Fornay 
who went into trance fifteen min-
utes ago. Forney is the name of 
some other guy fifty light-years away 
and you're stuck with his past. Only 
you don't have time to sit down and 
digest all this because winds are 
howling outside and there's your 
share 
of 
a 
ten-thousand-'hectare 
paddy and tons of negil sporelings 
to be planted before noon. 

"Ben, did you know that the fore-

noon on Cauldron lasts five months? 
And the first four and a half of them 
it rains. In the afternoon you work 
ill a temperature of 118 or up, keep-

IF 

ing a million poison-squirting water-
worms from eating or poisoning the 
negil roots. You've got the little 
black bugs for company, chomping 
away on your eyelashes. But nights 
are when you should be there, Ben. 
The waterworms go, the slime-weed 
comes, and the fever-midges swarm. 
Now about these midges. They cover 
your skin, they bore through your 
boots, they -
" 

"I get the picture." I did, too. 
He'd expect money. "So, Martin, 
you chucked it all and came back 
here, and you want me to move 
over and share the loot." But it 
wasn't exactly my cash, and I hadn't 
sequestered it from Hartch's sticky 
fingers only to hand it over to John 
Martin. "If you knew how fun-
ny-" 

"No, I'd rather survive on Caul-
dron than the way you're doing it 
here. The other colonists, if you 
want to call us that, sent me here 
to buy patterns -like me and like 
most of them. I've got them. They're 
stowed aboard the Star-Trader. Five 
thousand new colonists, Ben, for the 
weight of one man. But the main 
reason I promoted this trip for my-
self was to settle with you." 

"If you don't want money, what 
do you want?" 

"I guess you could call it re-

venge." Martin seemed to be weigh-
ing his words, as if uncertain how 
to put what he had to say. A feint, 
perhaps. I didn't take my .eyes off 
the android from Cauldron. 
Y ou see, Cauldron was one of 
those frontier worlds staked out 
by the FTL Corpsmen a generation 

A AS IN ANDROID 

or two before. It was even more rav-
enous than most for men. 

Some day, of course, Cauldron 
would be a tidy world where women 
could live, 
too, 
and 
youngsters 
thrive. At least, that was what the 
men of Cauldron had in mind. But 
right now the men of Cauldrol'\ had 
a tiger by the tail that they called 
a terraforming project. To keep this 
from blowing out from under them 
in ten different colors, they had to 
put Earth's wealth to work where 
it would do the mest good just as 
fast as they could get their hands on 
it. The wealth came from their negil 
crop, which they hand-processed and 
shipped to Earth. Terrans like Our 
Beloved 
Leader and his cohorts 
prized the vile-tasting green powder 
for its rejuvenating properties. But 
the growing and harvesting and pro-
cessing of the stuff -
plus the ter-
raforming going on at the same 
time, plus the colonists' own food 
crops- required the cooperation of 
great numbers of men- on a world 
not designed with regard to men's 
tolerances. From what I'd heard, is 
was a steaming edition of Hades, 
complete with smell. Upwards of 
seventy per :ent of the new colonists 
died within months of midge fever 
or other distempers. 
But Martin had survived. 
"I survived. I even adapted. It's 
a new planet opening up, even if it 
is hell, and I've done well there. 
Have my own plantation now in the 
terraformed sector and I'm testing 
out a new strain of sporelings ... " 

As Martin talked I'd been edging 

closer to that blaster. Now I reached 
for it. 

But he got there first. and rammed 
it against my belly. "Ben, don't try 
things like that," he said, almost 
tiredly. "Your reflexes aren't what 
they used to be." 

I tried not to flinch. "You couldn't 
blast me. It would be like blasting 
yourself." 

"Don't count on that too hard. 
Where would I be now if you'd got 
there first?" With the blaster he ges-
tured toward the door. "Looks like 
we'll have to do this the hard way. 
You're coming with me." 

"Coming where? My God, you're 
not going to kill me?" 

"Out!" 
Well, that doorway was what I 
wanted to go through. I went out. 
But also, my hand cupped the stud 
in my pocket, and as Martin stepped 
through I pressed it. 
Martin collapsed to the floor with-

out a sound. I fled. 
Halfway down the hall I stopped 
running and started thinking. There 
was no place to go, so why hurry? 
Martin had said he intended to re-
turn to Cauldron on the Star-Trader 
-
today. He'd done right well there 
in spite of everything. 

Maybe I'd sent the wrong one of 
us off-planet. 

Things could hardly be hotter 
there than they were here. In an in-
stant my mind was made up. If I 
stayed on Earth I was a dead man. 
Worse, I'd betray others. I'd go to 
Cauldron on Martin's -that is, on 
the android's- ticket. If Hartch 
didn't catch me first. 
A journey to a star, we're told, 
begins with a single step. For 

me, that step had to be back oast 
where Martin lay on the floor,· to 
the desk where I kept the cash. The 
cash belonged to our project but ariy 

membe~ could use it in an emer· 
gency. It had seemed safe from 
Hartch's cupidity; the man had an 
almost psychic affinity for other 
people's money. At least it was safer 
here than in one of the obvious 
places like home or under ground. 
I'd picked up the gladstone on the 
way past him. Now.I emptied it. All 
it contained was a change of cloth-
ing and a few odds and ends. 
My conscience, what was left of 
it, staged a short-lived revolt. What 
was left of it was still bucking like 
a bronc on the old tri-dis at things 
I'd been party to in recent years. 
You'd think he'd shut up now th:tt 
I'd landed right here on the bulls· 
eye trying to make him happy. I 
was in no mood for further ap-
peasement. It made i~ harder, though, 
that this android and I were closer 
than 
identical 
brothers. 
Leaving 
Martin here to Hartch's tender mer-
cies was almost a form of suicide. 
But I 
scot~;:hed that whole argu· 

ment quick, as something out of the 
old fanciful romances inspired by 
the Humanics idea in its early days. 
Humanics had made androids only 
after the original was deceased. And 
there must be a lot that the Human· 
ics people themselves didn't know, 
because I shook with unreasoning 
hatred of this android. I wanted to 
kill him with my bare hands, and 
he-
He'd come back from fifty light-

years to settle our score, with only 
his hands as weapon. 

IF 

That straightened me out on ev-

erything. 
I stuffed the ca~h into the glad-

stone. Then came the worst part, 
and I almost didn't make it. The 
ticket had to be on the android's 
person ... 
I f you were a Humanics client back 

in the old days, you simply went 
every three months or so to their 
nearest center, for trance. During 
trance, the biometry people record-
ed everything about you from your 
gene pattern to your personality pat-
tern, complete with memories con-
scious and subconscious, up to mo-
ment of trance. Also, a micro-
biopsy sample of your flesh was re-
moved and stored in a blob of DNA-
RNA complex, to use as a starter. 
Humanics packed this whole record 
of yours into a stasis-box the size 
of a sleeping capsule, and that was 
that. Unless you died before your 
time. 
Then, after complying with cer-

tain legal requirements, Humanics 
took your latest capsule and, using 
Kuzarian techniques, re-created you, 
to all intents and purposes. All that 
was lost -
aside from your per-

sonal life and death, that is -
was 
whatever experience and memory 
had been added between your lat-
est recording and your death. Im-
mortality, of a sort. 
The whole transaction about this 
android had begun some twenty-
five years earlier, when I was twen-
ty-six. Legally, a man's patterns be-
longed to himself. So, when this 
man from Cauldron made me the 
offer I promptly claimed a pattern 

A AS JN ANDROID 

from Humanics that I'd made fiw 
years earlier and sold it to him. 
I'd thought about that transaction 
now and then. In fact, I'd tried not 
to think about it, because of the 
guilty knowledge that that other "I" 
went to Cauldron to undergo an 
agonizing death. And yet-
Well, it wasn't only the cash: Or 

so I told myself at times, especial-
ly since my opinion of O.B.L. had 
soured. In a way, I belonged on the 
frontier world that I could never 
hope to buy a ticket for, since su::h 
a ticket would cost a not-so-small 
fortune. · There were outlets there 
for the energies that drove and 
goaded me and wasted themselves 
and me, here on my home planets. 
Sometimes I imagined that other had 
survived. But even then that sarcas-
tic remnant of conscience wasn't 
satisfied; it pointed the finger at me 
for that other ruthless, younger me 
living on a storm-lashed planet, 
cursing me and the day he was re-
created on that hell-world I'd sold 
him into- and that I'd never know. 
I had my ticket for Couldron-
which was a good thing, because 
there seemed to be no ticket office 
as such in the vast underground 
Spaceport Administration Building. 
The only concession to the rare and 
unsolicited interstellar passenger -
who took up a lot more room than 
valued cargo- was a small, ne-
glected waiting room whose bare 
walls half-echoed with my footsteps 
as I crossed to scan the old-fashioned 
bulletin board in one comer. The 
riotice promineotiJ diJplayed there 
informed: 

.CI 

LIFT-OFF 
FOR CAULDRON AT 12 
NOON. PASSENGERS NOW LOADING 

Once aboard, it would take prac-
tically an extradition order to get 
me off again, and it was now 1125. 
I felt for the wallet and pulled it 
out. The trouble was: with it I 
pulled out the whole picture of the 
other time I'd set eyes on it, when 
I'd been ransacking Martin's pockets. 
I'd glanced in the wallet, seen the 
big yellow ticket, then as I jammed 
the wallet into my own pocket I 
saw that Martin's eyes were open and 
he was staring at me. His eyes were 
practically all he'd be able to move 
for five or six hours, and they an-
noyed the hell out of me. In the 
end, I propped him into the chair 
behind my desk, faced him away, 
then got out fast with the wallet 
and the gladstone and the blaster. 
Now, in the waiting room, I stuffed 
the wallet back without looking in-
side- and found I'd taken a couple 
of steps back towards the exit. 
I 
was 
reasonably 
safe -
if I 
stayed here until I could arrange to 
board the Star-Trader. Starships as 
a refuge just didn't figure in any-
one's scheme of things. The fares 
were astronomical and access was 
by ticket only, even for the crew. 
It would be hours before Martin 
could tell Hartch about that ticket. 
I headed for a chair to light up and 
pull myself together before any more 
suicidal impulses toward that exit 
took hold of me. I'd already done 
my Stupid Deed for the decade when 
I joined up with the plotters in the 
first place, and I sure couldn't af-
ford another stupidity this soon. The 

old waiting room was oddly quiet. 

Oh, the building as 
a whole 
hummed with purposeful activity 
and distant voices through distant 
loudspeaker, but this room . was 
apart. I sat there and pointed out to 
Martin -
his eyes were still star-
ing at me with that damned helpless 
hatred, just as though he sat here 
facing me instead of in that chair 
five miles away- that he was some-
one else, that in any case I owed him 
nothing. As I say, I unqerstood per-
fectly the depth of his hatred for 
me. It didn't surprise me he'd gone 
to the trouble and expense or re-
turning to Terra to settle my guts -
and would have succeeded, except 
for the sonic deadfall. And if he 
didn't, 
then 
the Loyalty 
Police 
would -
in spades. 
I tamped out the cigarette, got up 
and headed for that bulletin board 
again to find out what I was sup-
posed to do next. There were two 
more notices: 

ALL VALUABLES MUST BE DEPOSIT-

ED WITH PURSER PRIOR TO EMBARK-
ATION. 

ALL BAGGAGE MUST BE DEPOSITED 

WITH PURSER FOR INSPECTION AND 
TRANSPORTATION ARRANGEMENTS. 

The purser was a gray sort of 
man who asked no questions. He 
and his reflection in the mirrored 
wall weighed the bags, and money 
changed hands. He asked me for my 
ticket to punch the transaction out 
on, and that seemed to be that. I 
opened the wallet. 

"I'll record that now, sir, if you'll 
hand it to me." The purser's voice 
had a trace of impatience as I coo-

IF 

tinued staring sickly at what was in 
my hand, because that was when I 
first saw the second ticket. 
John Martin had in that wallet 
not only his own return ticket to 
Cauldron, but an extra one, and the 
extra ticket had my name on it. 
Martin, then, bad not planned 
to kill me on the spot. 
In an instant my whole structure 
of 
rationalizations 
toppled- the 
ones I'd argued with John Martin's 
accusing eyes in the waiting room. 
His eyes now somehow meshed with 
those that stared at me from the 
mirrored wall. They made it quite 
clear that when I walked onto that 
starship alone, everything between 
us would be over with. I saw my 
band shaking. I got up and headed 
blindly for the dom. 

"Your bag, sir?" The purser's 
voice was definitely annoyed. "If 
you'ye changed your mind about go-
ing, you'll want your bag back." 
I went back to his desk long 
enough 
to 
check 
the 
baggage 
through- in Martin's name. Seemed 
the least I could do for him, though 
the chances now of either of us ever 
having a use for that money were 
slightly less favorable than the prog-
nosis for an ice-cube in hell. Then I 
left the ·Administration Building and 
went back after John Martin. 
W hen I got back the· door was 
still open, but Martin wasn't 
there. Hartch was sprawled in the 
chair instead. He whirled and faced 
me and grinned like a man who's 
just been paid off on a long-shot. 

"I played a hunch you might 
show up here, Fornay." 

A AS 
~N ANDROID 

He was a thickset man startina 

to run to jowls, and his black eyel 
bored into me. 

"What made you think I'd come 
here, Monitor Hartch?'' I heard my-
self ask him. 

"Fornay, I wonder if you know 
how close you came to getting away 
without a trace. When all other 
clues petered out I took a flyer on 
your, uh, double, hel'e. I don't know 
why you did this to him, but I felt 
in my bones you'd come trotting 
back for him. I wanted to be on 
hand to collect when that Calvinis-
tic background of yours paid off in 
stupidity. And don't try your little 
deadfall again. I deactivated it." 

I didn't see Hartcb draw his 
blaster, it was just in his hand. "Our 
Beloved Leader wants to see you, 
Fornay." 

With Martin's absence I felt too 
numb to resist- not that resistance 
was possible. All I said was, "Did 
you 
have 
to 
incinerate 
him, 

Hartch?" 

A yellow-toothed smile took place 
on his face. "Incinerate? No. I think 
Our Beioved Leader will want to 
reserve that pleasure for himself. 
With two of you he can have twice 
the satisfaction." 
Martin, then, was still alive. My 
eyes went to the closet door and 
Hartch nodded. 
Martin was there, all right, when 

Hartcb slid the door aside, but the 
close quarters hadn't done him any 
-good. He lay in a crumpled heap, 
and it took me several seconds to 
be sure he still breathed. 
Hartch was fiddliD& with his walk-

talky. 

I said "Wllit! Let's talk business." 
Ten minutes later we were back 
at 
the Spaceport 
Administration 
Building- Martin 
(still 
uncon-
scious), myself and Hartch. 
Hartch flashed his badge at the 
purser, who verified for him the sum 
of the cash in the gladstone. But the 
bag was by now, of course, aboard 
the starship. The purser looked less 
gray and nondescript as he told 
Hartch that only a written order 
signed by the person in whose name 
the valuables were signed through 
could get them off the Star-Trader. 
I had signed them through in Mar-
tin's name. But this presented no ser-
ious difficulty, since as far as the 
purser knew -
or feigned to know 
-I was John Martin. 
I got Martin aboard and as com-
fortable as possible before I signed 
the gladstone over to Hartch. 
In the minutes remaining before 
lift-off I made one 25-cent coded 
telephone call- and gof far more 
than my money's worth.;..,.. 

-
j 

~n hours later, in hyperspace, 
l. Martin and I were sitting at 
the ship's tiny bar. 

"So that second ticket was what 
made you come back for 
me. 
Propped in that chair I was sure I 
wouldn't be on the Star-Trader when 
she left." 

"Good God, you must've bought 
that ticket out of your own pocket!" 

"Saved every credit of my profits 
since I hit Cauldron to buy that 
ticket, Ben. A lot of the guys talk 
about going back. I did it." 

I poured him another drink. "That 

extra ticket proved you weren't try-
.u 

ing to kill me but to rescue -
" 

"Ben, I'm going to be honest. 
You should've left me in that closet. 
Rescue, hell! If I'd known you need· 
ed rescuing I'd probably have stayed 
home and farmed the profits back 
into the plantation. I hated you 
that much -or thought" I did. Kid-
naping was more what I had in 
mind. Wanted you to find out what 
you'd let that other self of yours in 
for. You being so damned safe wu 
what curdled me." 

"Safe!" 
"Huh? Oh hell, I'm not sorry I 
came back- except that you gave 
money to Hartch on my account." 

"And I'm not sorry I went back 
for you -
not that I had a real 
choice. We're really the same en-
tity, John. You and I and the man 
in the mirror_ A man can't cut off 
his own arm, can he?" 

'"Urn." 
"Don't worry about the .money. 
I had one name that poor Smith-
son didn't and I made a phone call 
before we left. Hartch and his funds 
were, shall I say, adequately met." 

"Good work," Martin grinned. 

"When we get to Cauldron I'll have 
a quarterly share waiting for me. 
I'd like to put it where it'll do the 
most good." 

"I'll help you put it there if-
John. D'you think I can fit in?" 

"You may wish you'd chosen to 
stay home and be killed. But if you 
can live through the first few months 
and take the work, you've got it 
made- friend. We can be a sort of 
double threat to the status quo." 

"I'll drink to that- friend." 
We did.

PRINCE 
AND THE 
PIRATE 
ILLUSTRATED BY NODEL 

BY KEITH LAUMER 

I 

Retiei reined in the tall-shoul-
dered urze-beast with a jingle 
of the hunting-bells attached to the 
long-legged mount's harness. 
The trail of the dirosaur led 
straight ahead into a dense thicket 
of iron-rod trees, now bent and 
twisted by the passing of the wound-
ed monster. Far away, the hunting 
horns of the main party sounded. 
Retief smiled. Prince Tavilan would 

employ a choice selection of royal 
oaths when he learned that a mere 
diplomat had beaten him to the 
quarry's turn-at-bay. 
A windy screech sounded from 
the depths of the thicket. Retief 
raised his saddle-horn and blew an 
answering blast. There was a clang-
ing of branches, a scraping of ar-
mored hide on metallic bark. Retief 
dropped the horn to swing 'lt the 
pommel. With a pull of a lever he 
cocked his crossbow, waiting. 

A tiny head, mostly jaws, armed 
with a foot-long spike below the 
mouth, snaked out from the grove, 
hissing a ferocious warning. Retief's 
urze-beast stirred and tossed its 
head at the scent of the dirosaur. 
Trees shuddered aside as the great 
carnivore forced its bulk between 
them, its golden-yellow eyes fixed 
on the man. A clawed foreleg as 
big as a man's body, set with rusty 
scales, raked the ground, dragging 
the predator's multi-ton bulk into 
the clear. With a final clangorous 
flick of its log-like tail, the dirosaur 
broke free, reared its head into 
striking position and charged. 
Retief raised the crossbow and 
took aim-
The 
crossbow· bucked. 
Retief 
spurred aside. He had a momentary 
glimpse of a two-foot shaft of pol-
ished steel protruding from the eye 
spcket of the monster as it blun-
dered past, the long neck falling, to 
collapse in a cloud of dust, lie 
twitching, then still. 
I t was five minutes before tihe 

hunt galloped into view, Prince 

Tavilan's black-crested urze-beast in 
the lead. He slowed to a canter, 
rode up beside the fallen dirosaur 
and sat looking down at the open· 
jawed head, the yellow eyes glazing 
in death. 

"That's another barrel of royal 
vintage I owe you, Retief,'' he said. 
"If I ever see the palace cellars 
again." He was a tall, wide, sandy-
haired man with a turned-up, sun-
burned nose. His leather forest garb 
was well worn. There were cockle-
burrs in the snow-tiger facings of 
his royal Eloran blue cape. The 
'"

crossbow slung across his back wu 
his only weapon. 

"We're 
wasting 
time 
hunt-
ing game," a riJer at the prince's 
side said. "There's a plentiful supply 
of crossbow bolts at the lodge. I 
propose we ride down into Elora 
City and distribute them among the 
good Prime Minister's Greenbacks 
-
point first." 
"The king still has hopes the CDT 
will 
revise 
its 
policy." 
Tavilan 
glanced at Retief. "If· the triple-
damned embargo were lifted, Min-
ister Prouch and his talk of a Re-
gency would evaporate faster than 
the royal treasury has under his 
control." 

"Oh, it's not an Embargo, your 

Highness," Retief said. "I believe 
Ambassador Hidebinder refers to it 
as a unilateral shift in emphasis bal-
ance-of-trade-wise to a more group-
oriented-" 

"What it adds up to is the Royal 
Eloran Navy grounded, while trai-
tors plot in the palace and Dan-
gredi's pirates raid shipping at the 
edge of Elorari atmosphere!" Tavi-
lan smacked a fist into his palm. 
"I've got the finest corps of naval 
combat commanders in the Eastern· 
Arm, forty-five battle-ready ships of 
the line -
and, thanks to CDT pol-

icy, no fuel! So much for my coop-
eration with vour Ambassador, Re-
tief!" 
· 

"Didn't he explain that, Your 

Highness? If you had the Big Pic-
ture, it would all make sense. Of 
course, I'm a Small Picture man 
myself, so I'm afraid I can't be of 
much help in explaining it." 

"It's not your doing, Retief. But 

• 
million Elorans are about to 
IF 

have 
a dictatorship clamped on 
them because I lack a few megaton/ 
seconds of firepower." 

"Your great grandfather's mistake 
was in being a romantic. If he'd 
named his planet Drab Conformity, 
set up a committee of bureaucrats 
to run it and used the forest to sup-
ply paper mills instead of hunting 
in them, you'd be the apple of the 
collective CDT eye today." 

"The old man led a hard life. 
When he found Elora it was a wil-
derness. He made his fortune and 
then arranged matters here to suit 
himself -
and we Elorans still like 

parties!" 

Retief glanced at the sun. "Speak-

ing of which, I'd better be starting 
back. The Grande Balle d'Elore is 
tonight and Mr. Magnan will be up-
set if I'm not there to help him 
hover nervously for at least an hour 
before 
the 
Ambassador 
comes 

down." 

"Retief, you're not riding back to 
the city?" Count Arrol looked up 
from cutting out the dirosaur's chin-
horn. He stood. "I told you what my 
man reported. Your sympathies are 
too well known to suit Prouch. To-
night, at the ball -" 

"I don't think the worthy Prime 

Minister will go that far. He's de-
pendent on the good will of the 
CDT -
and 
diplomat-killing 
is 
bad publicity." 

"The Palace Guard is still loyal," 

Tavilan said. "And remember the 
lad;· Aric. You can trust him with 
any mission within his strength. He's 
working in the palace as a mess ser-
vant." He laughed bitterly. "Think 
of us as you dance with the fair la-
dies of the court, Retief. If you see 
.a 

my father, tell him I and my In-
vincibles will continue to skulk here 
in the Deep Forest as he com-
mands- but we long for action." 

"I'll get word to you, Tavilan," 
Retief said. "My conspiratorial in-
stinct tells me that there'll be ac-
tion enough for everybody before 
sunrise tomorrow." 

II 
I n the Grand Ballroom at the 

Palace of Elora, Retief cast an 
eye over the chattering elite of the 
court, the gorgeously gowned and 
uniformed couples, the glum repre-
sentatives of the People's Party, the 
gaudily dressed diplomats from Yill, 
Fust, Flamme and half a hundred 
other worlds. A cluster of ~pider­
lean Groaci whispered together near 
a potted man-eating plant, •Jne leaf 
of which quivered tentively, seemed 
to sniff the aliens and withdrew 
hastily. Retief plucked a glass from 
a wide silver tray offered by a 
bright-eyed mess boy in a brocaded 
bolero jacket and a cloth-of-gold 
turban, who glanced quickly around 
the crowded ballroom, then ~tepped 
close to whisper: 

"Mr. Retief- the 
rascals 
are 
forcing the lock on your room!" 

Retief passed the glass under his 
nose and sipped. 

"Exactly which rascals do you 
mean, Aric?" he murmured. "We've 
got about four sets to choose from." 

Aric grinned. "A couple of the 
Groaci Ambassador's boys," he whis-
pered. "The ones he usually uses for 
high-class back-alley work." 

Retief nodded. "That would be 

Yilith and Sith, formerly of the 
IF 

Groaci Secret Police. Things must 
be coming to a head. It's not like 
old Lhiss to take such direct action." 
He finished the drink and put the 
empty glass on a black marble ta-
ble. 

"Come on, Aric. Ditch that tray 
and let's take a walk." 

In the broad, mirror-hung corri-
dor, Retief turned to the right. 

"But, Mr. 
Rctief," Aric said. 
"Your apartment's in the other di-
rection." 

"They won't find anything there, 
Aric- and it would be embarrass-
ing for all concerned if I caught 
them red-handed. So while they're 
occupied, I'll just take this oppor-
tunity to search their rooms." 
At the top of the wide spiral 
staircase that led from the 
public areas of the palace to the liv-
mg quarters assigned to foreign dip-
lomatic missions, Retief paused. 

"You wait here, Aric." He went 
along the corridor to the third door, 
a simple white-painted panel edged 
with a tiny carved floral design. He 
tried the large gold doorknob, then 
took a slender instrument from an 
inner pocket of his silver-epauletted 
tangerine mess jacket and delicately 
probed the lock. The bolt snicked 
back. He eased the door open, 
glanced around, then stepped back 
out and beckoned Aric to him. 

"How'd you get it open, Mr. Re-

tief?" 

"Locks are a hobby of mine. Pa-

trol the corridor, and if you see any-
body, cough. If it's one of my Groa-
ci colleagues, have a regular parox-
ysm. I won't be long." 

Inside the room. Retief made a 

THE PRINCE AND THE PIRATE 

fast check of the desk, the dresser 
drawers, the undersides of furniture; 
He slapped sofa cushions, ;•n·odded 
mattresses for tell-tale cracklings, 
then 
opened 
the 
closet 
door. 
Through the wall, faint voices were 
audible, scratchy with the quality of 
narrow-range amplification. 
He stooped and plucked- a tiny 
earphone from 
a miniature wall 
bracket. Ambassador· Lhiss, it ap-
peared, 
was 
not immune 
from 
eavesdropping by his own staff ... 
Relief put the phone to his ear. 
" ... agreed, 
then," 
Ambassa-
dor Hidebinder's voice was saying. 
"Seventy-two hours from now, and 
not a moment before." 

"Just see that you keep your end 
of the bargain," a thin Groaci voice 
lisped. "This would be a poor time 
for treachery." 

"I want it clearly understood that 
our man will be treated in a reason-
ably civilized fashion, and quietly 
released to us when the affair is 
completed." 

"I suggest you avoid. over-compli-
cating the arrangements with last-
minute 
conditions," 
the 
Groaci 
voice said. 

"You've done very well in this af-

fair," Hidebinder came back. "Your 
profits on the armaments alone-" 

"As I recall, it was you who pro-

posed the scheme. It is you who 
wish to place homeless Soetti rab-
ble on Elora, not we." 

Retief listened for another five 

minutes before 
he 
snapped 
the 
phone back in its bracket, stepped 
quickly to the door. In the hall, Aric 
came to meet him. 

"Find anything, Mr. Retief?" 
"Too much." Retief took a pen .., 

from his pocket and jotted a note. 

"See that this gets to Prince Tavi-
lan at the lodge. Tell him to get 
the Invincibles ready, but to do 
nothing until I get word to him-
no matter what." 

"Sure, Mr. Retief, but-" 
"Let's go, Aric. And remember: 
you're more help to me outside 
than inside." 

"I don't follow you, Mr. Retief." 
Aric trotted at his side. "Outside 
what?" 

"We'll know in a few minutes. 
But wherever I wind up, watch for 
a signal." 
From the head of the Grand 
staircase Retief saw the glint of 
light on steel. Two men in the dull 
black and green of the People's Vol-
unteers stood in the corridor. 

"Hey, Mr. Reticf," Aric whis-
pered. "What are Greenbacks do-
ing in the palace?" 

"Simple, Aric. They're standing 
guard over my door." 

"Maybe somebody caught those 
Groaci trying to break in." 

"Drop back behind me, Aric -
and remember what I said." 
Retief walked up to his door, 
took out an old-fashioned me-
chanical key and inserted it in the 
lock. One of the two armed soldiers 
stepped up and made a threatening 
motion with his rifle butt. 

"Nobody goes in there, you," he 
growled. He was a broad-faced 
blond, a descendant of the trans-
ported felons who had served as 
contract labor on Elora a century 
earlier. 
Retief turned casually, moved to 
one side far enough that the man 

before him was between him and 
his companion, then moved sudden-
ly. He caught the stock of the rifle 
in his left hand and with his right 
yanked the barrel forward; the butt 
described 
a short arc, smashed 
against the soldier's chin. He gave a 
choked yell and stumbled back. 
Retief jerked the 
door open, 
slipped inside, slammed it behind 
him. He shot the bolt, then started 
a fast check of his room. The door 
rattled; heavy poundi!lgs sounded. 
Retief pulled open the desk. A loose 
heap of unfamiliar papers lay there. 
A glance at one showed the letter-
head of the Office of the Commer-
cial Attache, Terrestrial Embassy. 
It appeared to be a delivery order 
for one hundred thousand rounds ·of 
fractionaljton 
ammunition 
made 
out to a Bogan armaments export-
er. Another was an unsigned letter 
referring to drop-points and large 
sums of money. A heavy parchment 
caught Reliefs eye. It was stamped 
in red: 

UTTER TOP SECRET 

Below the seal of the Eloryan 
Imperial Department of War was a 
detailed breakout of the disposition 
of units of the Imperial Fleet and 
the Volunteer Reserve. 
The 
telephone 
buzzed. 
Relief 
picked it up. There was a sound of 
breathing at the other end. 

"Yilith?" a faint voice inquired. 
"No, you damned fool!" Retief 
snapped. "They finished up ten min-
utes ago. When do the Greenbacks 
arrive?" 

"Why, they should be there now. 
The pigeon has left the ballroom-" 
IF 

There was a pause. "Who is this?" 
Retief slammed down the phone, 
whirled 
to 
the 
wide 
fireplace, 
flipped the switch that started a 
cheery blaze licking over the pseu-
do-logs. ·He grabbed up a handfull 
of papers from the desk, tossed 
them into the fire, started back for 
another-
With a rending of tough plastic 
panels, 
the 
door 
bulged, 
then 
slammed open. Half a dozen Green-
backs charged into the room, short 
bayonets fixed and leveled. Retief's 
hand went behind him, felt over the 
small table at his back, plucked 
open the drawer, fished out a tiny 
slug gun and dropped it into a back 
pocket. 
· 

A tall man with small head, 
a body like a bag of water, 
and tiny feet bellied his way through 
the armed men. He wore a drab 
cutaway of grayish-green adorned 
with the star of the Order of Farm 
Production. Behind him, the small, 
spindle-armed figure of the Groaci 
Military Attache was visible, decked 
out in formal jewel-studded eye-
shields and a pink and green hip-
cloak. 

"Don't touch anything!" the wa-
ter-bag man called in a high, ex-
cited voice. "I want everything un-
disturbed!" 

"What about the fire, Mr. Minis-

ter?" the Groaci lisped. "The mis-
creant seems to have been burning 
something." 

"Yes, yes. Rake those papers out 
of there!" The large man wobbled 
his chins agitatedly. He fixed Re-
tief with eyes like peeled eggs. "I'm 
warning you. don't move." 

THE PRINCE AND THE PIRATE 

· "Let me have a cr;;ck at him," a 
Greenback said. "He fixed Horney 
so he won't be able to eat nothing 
but mush for six months." 

"None of that!" The big-bellied 
man held up a hand. A striped vest 
bulged under his voluminous frock 
coat like a feather mattress. "We'll 
just hold him for the authorities.'' 

"Any particular reason why you 
and your friends came to · play in 
my room?" Retief enquired mildly. 
"Or were you under the impression 
it was . my birthday?" 

"Look here," a man caUed from 
across the room. "Under the mat-
tress!" He held up a paper. "A let-
ter from the pirate, Dangredi, ad-
dressed to Retief, thanking him for 
the latest consignment of arms and 
supplies!" 

"If you'll wait just a minute," Re-
tief said, "I'll get my scrapbook. It's 
full of all kinds of incriminating evi-
dence I've been saving for just this 
occasion." 

"Ah, then you confess! Where is 

it?" the Groaci whispered hoarsely, 
pushing to the fore. 

"Oh, I forgot. When I heard you 
coming, I ate it." 
T here was a stir at the rear of 
the group. The ranks parted 
and a short, round Terrestrial with 
a stiff white mustache and a mouth 
like a change-purse pushed through. 
He yanked at the overlapping lapels 
of a grape-juice colored mess-jacket 
caked with decorations. 

"Here, what's this Mr. Retief! 
Contraband? Pflfet:ed 
documents? 
Evidence of traffic with piratical 
elements?" 

"No, Mr. Ambassador," Retief 

said. "I'm only charging them with 
breaking and entering. assault with 
a deadly weapon, abuse of diplo-
matic privilege and loitering. If 
you'll-" 

"Here, don't let him confuse the 
issue, Ambassador Hidebinder!" The 
egg- like eyes rolled toward the 
stout diplomat. "He stands self-con-
victed." 

"Don't say too much, Mr. Minis-

ter," Retief cut in. "After all, you 
haven't had time yet to read those 
scraps the boys are fishing out of 
the fire; so it wouldn't do for you 
to know what they are." 

"Enough of this pointless chat-

ter!" Prime Minister Prouch piped. 
"Obviously, there's treason afoot 
here!" He jabbed a finger at the Ter-
restrial Ambassador. "In view of the 
seriousness of the offense -
in a 
time of grave crisis in inter-world 
affairs -I demand that you sus-
pend this criminal's diplomatic im-
munity!" 

The Groaci spoke up: "As a neu-

tral party, I propose that he be 
turned over to my mission for re-
straint until the time of trial." 

"Well ... " Ambassador Hidebind-

rr blinked. "I'm not at all sure ... " 

"We'll tolerate no stalling tactics!" 
The Minister squeaked. "The secur-
ity of Elora is at stake!" He mo-
tioned. The troops closed iri around 
Retief. 

"I propose to take this man into 
custody at once." He bulged his eyes 
at Hidebinder. "I trust there will be 
no protest!" 

Hidebinder looked around at the 
room, 
the scattered papers, the 
smouldering fire, then at Retief. 

"Your penchant for mischief is 

well-known, Mr. Retief," he said 
acidly. "I'm sure this fits the pattern 
nicely." 

"Not as nicely as you imagine," 
Retief said. "Maybe you'd better 
think it over- without any help 
from Ambassador Lhiss." 

Hidebinder 
purpled 
and sput-

tered. "The man's run amok! You 
have my permission to place him 
under 
protective 
restraint!" 
He 
stamped from the room. 
General Hish stepped forward. 

"Soldiers you heard the order of the 
Minister," he hissed. "Take the crim-
inal away!" 

III 
T he celt was ten feet 
~quare, 

with a twelve by eighteen inch 
opening just under the ten-foot high 
ceiling. 
The furnishings included a plastic 
cot with one blanket, the minimum 
in plumbing facilities, one small, un-
shielded neon lamp, numerous large 
roaches and a bristly rat over a foot 
long, which sat by the floor drain 
from which it had emerged, regard-
ing Retief with beady eyes. 
Retiers hand went slowly to the 
small, hard pillow on the cot beside 
him. He picked it up, pegged it sud-
denly. 
With a squeal of rage, the rat dove 
for 
the 
rusted-out drain 
cover, 
scrabbled for a moment in a fran-
tie attempt to squirm past the cush-
ion, now wedged in the drain; then 
it darted for the darkest corner of 
the cell. 
Retief picked up the blanket and 
a length of yarn worked from it 
earlier, moved toward the rat. It 

IF 

a 

it leaped 

straight at Retief's face- and met 
the enveloping blanket in midair. 

Cautiously, Retief folded back 
the ·blanket to expose the chinless, 
snouted face, 
armed with back-

slanting yellow fa0gs half an inch 
long, He looped the string over the 
vicious head, and knotted it. 
He went to the drain, kicked the 

obstruction from it, then released 
the tethered rat. It dived down the 
dark opening and was gone. 

The carefully coiled string paid 
out rapidly, loop after loop. It 
slowed, then fed down the drain 
more slowly as the rat traveled 
through the piping. The guard's 
footsteps approached. 

Retief jumped for the cot; he was 
stretched out at ease when the sen-
try looked in. When he had passed, 

THE PRINCE AND THE PIRATE 

Retief _looped the end of the string 
over his fmger, pulled in the slack. 
In the gloomy light of the neon 
lamp, 
the 
thread 
was 
invisible 
against the dark floor. He sat on 
the bunk and waited. 
An hour 
passed. 
The 
barred 

rectangle of moonlight slant-

ing through the window crept across 
the floor. Regularly, at nine-minute 
intervals, feet sounded in the pas-
sage outside the metal slab door. 
Suddenly the string in Retief's hand 
twitched, "nee, twice, three times. 
He gave three answering tugs. For 
a moment there was no response; 
then there was a single firm tug. 
Aric was on the job ... 
Retief pulled at the string. It 
dragged heavily. He hauled it in 
slowly, hand over hand. 

Twice it caught on some obstruc-

tion far away in the drain line; he 
t'ugged gently until it came free. He 
•;hrust 
the 
accumulating pile 
of 
thread under the mattress. Each 
time the guard looked in, he was 
sitting quietly, staring at the wall. 
Suddenly, the end of a half-inch 
rope apreared, securely tied to the 
end of the string. Retief let it slip 
back a few inches, waited until the 
sentry passed, then quickly began 
hauling in the rope. 
Five minutes later, a hundred 
feet of polyon cable were tucked 
out of sight unJer the mattress. 
Retief slipped the bundle of hack-

saw blades which had been tied to 
the end of the rope into the pocket 
of the gold-braided white trousers 
which he had been allowed to re-
tain along with his short boots. He 
stood under the window, gauged the 
distance. then jumped. He pulled 
himself up. ,!'O! a firm grip on the 
bars, then too\ out a saw and start-
ed in. 
An hour later, both bars were 
cut through. ready to be removed 
by a single firm twist. 

Retief waited for the guard to 
pass. then dropped the blades down 
the drain. looped the cable over his 
shoulder and leaped up to the win-
dow again. Far below, he could see 
the moonlight sparkling on a foun-
tain in the palace garden; the sha-
dows of trees and hedges were dark 
against the grass. On the graveled 
walks, armed sentries paced. 
Retief wrenched the bars free, 
tied the rope to one, tossed the coil 
of rope through the window, then 
pulled himself up, carefully fitting 
the short bar across the comer of 

1-4 

the window-opening on the inside. 
Keeping pressure on the rope, he 
eased out, then slid quickly down. 
T we.nty 
feet 
below. 
Retief 
dropped onto a narrow bal-

cony before a rank of darkened 
glass doors. 
With a flick, he freed the upper 
end of the rope. The bar clattered· 
against the stone wall as it fell. He 
pulled the rope in, dropped it in a 
heap, then tried door handles until 
he found one that turned. He 
stepped in through heavy drapes, 
felt his way across to the door, 
opened it and looked out into a 
wide corridor. 
At the far end, two ornately uni-

formed Palace Guards stood stiffly 
at attention. There was no one else 
in sight. Retief slipped the slug gun 
into the palm of his hand, stepped 
out, 
walked 
boldly 
toward 
the 
guards. They stood unmoving. As 
he passed, one spoke quietly from 
the corner of his mouth: 
"Greenbacks patrolling one flight 

up." 

"They're on the lookout for any 
suspicious activity," the other sentry 
added. 

"If I see any, I'll Jet you know," 
Retief said softly. "If you hear any 
loud noises, pay no attention. Gen-
eral Hish will be entertaining a 
guest." 

Retief followed the corridor, took 
a turn to the left, then a right, found 
the passage housing the Groaci Em-
bassy, now brightly lit. The apart-
ment of the military attache was 001 
the left, four doors along. 
A black-booted Greenback offi-

cer stepped into view from the far 
IF 

end of the passage, paused at sight 
of Retief striding unconcernedly to-
ward him. 
The Greenback nar-

rowed his eyes uncertainly, then 
snapped back the flap covering his 
sidearm, tugged at the heavy power 
pistol. Retief brought the slug gun 
up, fired at pointblank range. 
At the muffted whoomp! the offi-

cer slammed back, hit the floor and 
lay sprawled. His 
gun 
bounced 
against the wall. Rcjcf scooped it 
up, turned to the door of the Groaci 
General's quarters, needle-beamed 
the lock at low power. The hard-
ware dissolved in a wash of blue 
flame, an acrid stink of burned plas-
tic and metal. He kicked the door 
wide, turned and caught the fallen 
Greenback 
by 
the 
ankles 
and 
dragged him inside. 
A swift examination of the room 
revealed that it was deserted. Re-
lief picked up the phone and dialed. 

"Post 
number twenty-nine," 
a 
crisp' voice answered promptly. 

"This is the General's guest," Re-

tief said. "The light in the hall might 
hurt the General's eyes. Think you 
could douse it?" 

"We've had some trouble with 
fuses in that wing lately. I've got a 
feeling one might go out any min-
ute now- and· it will take maybe 
an hour to fix." The phone clicked 
off. 
Retief flipped off the lights in the 
room, went into the small, lavishly 
equipped 
kitchen, 
rummaged 
through the supplies of Groaci deli-
cacies, found a one-pound jar of 
caviar and a package of grain wa-
fers. He ate hurriedly, keeping an 
eye on the door, drank a small bot-
tle of Green Yill wine, then re-

l'HE PRINCE AND THE PIRATE 

turned to the living room. He 
stripped the Greenback and donned 
the drab uniform. 
The phone buzzed. Retief lifted 
the receiver. 

"Two minute alert," a low voice 
said. "He's alone." 
Retief went to the door, open~d 

it half an inch, stood in the shadows 
beside it. He heard the :;oft ap-
proach of mincing Groaci footsteps, 
then a soft exclamation -
He swung the door open, reached 
out, caught the Groaci by the throat 
and dragged him inside. He grunted 
as a booted foot caught him in the 
ribs; then he jammed the pistol hard 
against the Groaci's horny thorax. 

"No loud noises, please, General. 
I have a splitting headache." 

Retief pushed the door shut with 
a foot and leaned against the light 
button. A soft glow sprang up. Re-
tief released the Groaci, holding the 
gun aimed at a three-inch broad 
Grand Cordon of the Legion d'Cos-
me crossing the bulging abdomen. 

"I'm going out; you're coming 
with me. Better hope we make it." 

He holstered the pistol, showed 
the small, smooth-stone-shaped slug 
gun. "This will be a foot from your 
back, so be a good little soldier and 
give all the right answers." 

The Groacie's throat sacs dilated, 
vibrating. He cast a sidelong glance 
at the stripped body of the Green-
back. 

"The swift inevitability of your 

death," he hissed in Groaci. "To an-
ticipate with joy your end in fright-
ful torment ... " 

"To button your mandible and 

march," 
Retief 
interrupted. 
He 
pulled the door open. "After you." 

T he 
blaze 
of 
stars 
scattered 
from horizon to horizon above 
the palace roof. Their light gleamed 
on the polished fittings of a low-
slung heli parked on the royal pad, 
as Retief and his prisoner emerged 
from the service stair into the cold 
night air. There was a scrunch of 
boots on gravel, the snick! of a pow-
ergun's action. Abruptly a search-
light's beam glared. 

"Hey- aren't you-" 
"Do 
not 
interfere, 
soft-faced 

idiot!" the Groaci hissed. The light 
flashed across to him; his five 
beady, stemmed eyes glinted angrily 
at the guard. 

"General Hish, sir." The guard 
snapped off the light, presented 
arms hurriedly. Other boots sound· 
ed. coming across the roof-top. 

"What's 
going 
on here? Tell 
these -" the voice broke off. In the 
gloom, barely relieved by starlight, 
Retief saw the newcomer start, then 
put a hand to his pistol butt. 

"We require the use of the royal 

gig," Hish whispered. "Stand aside!" 

"But the orders-" the first guard 
started. 

"General, 
drop!" 
the 
second 
bawled, hauling his gun out. Retief 
shot him, took a short step and 
drove a hard punch to the jaw of 
the first Greenback, still standing, 
gaping, then caught the Groaci's 
arm, 
jump~d for the heli. Yells 
sounded across the roof. A yard-
wide. light-cannon, gymbal-mounted 
atop the guard shack, winked on, 
throwing a gray-blue tunnel of light 
into the sky; it pivoted, depressed, 
swept a burning disc across to Re-
tief-
He 
drew 
the 
power 
pistol, 

thumbed it to narrow beam and 
blasted the light. It exploded in a 
shower of tinkling glass, a billow of 
orange smoke that faded, winked 
out. 
Retief shoved the slender Groaci 
ahead of him, yanked wide the heli's 
entry hatch, tumbled his prisoner in 
and jumped after him. He rammed 
the control lever to EMERGENCY 
FULL CLIMB. With a whine of 
power, the finely engineered craft 
leaped from the roof, surged up-
ward in a buffet of suddenly stirred 
air. From below, blue and yellow 
flashes winked briefly against the 
discs of the screaming rotors; then 
they dwindled away and were gone. 

IV 
Half 
an 
hour 
later, 
Retief 
dropped the heli in low over 
the black tree-tops of the Deep 
Forest. 
A gleam of light reflected across 

rippling water. He edged the ma-
chine forward and swung out over 
the lake, dropping down to tree-top 
level. Below, the water churned in 
the down-draft from the rotors as 
the heli settled gently into two feet 
of water. Retief cut the engine and 
popped the hatch. Cold mountain air 
swirled in. Somewhere, water liz-
ards shrilled. 

"What place of infamy is this? 
the 
captive 
General 
hissed. 
He 
stared out into the darkness. "Do 
you bring me here to slay me un-
seen, vile disrespecter of diplomatic 
privilege?" 

"The idea has merit." Retief said, 

"but I have other plans for you, 
General." He climbed down, roo-

IF 

tioning the Groa.::i out. Hish grum-
bled, scrambling down into the icy 
water of the lake, slogging to shore. 
From the darkness a night-fowl 
called. 
Retief 
whistled 
a 
reply. 
There was the sound of a footstep 
in the brush, the click! of a cross-
bow's cocking mechanism. 

"It's Retief," he called. "I have a 
guest: General Hish, of the Groaci 
Embassy." 

"Ah, welcome, Retief," a soft 
voice 
drawled. 
"We're 
honored, 
General. Good of you to call. His 
Highness 
was 
hoping 
you'd 
be 
along soon ... " 
I nside 
the 
high-beamed 
lodge, 
Prince Tavilan came across the 
room. Behind him, Aric grinned. 

"I caught the rat all right, Mr. 

Retief." 

"Retief!" Tavilan clapped him on 
the shoulder. "Aric reached me with 
your message an hour ago. I heard 
the news of your arrest on Tri-D. 
They broke into a concert to an-
nounce that a plot involving the 
CDT and reactionary Royalist ele-
ments had been uncovered." 

"Hidebinder will be very unhap-
py with that version of events," Re-
tief said. "The agreement was that 
it was all to be blamed on a rotten 
apple in the Corps barrel. Namely 
me." 

"We were saddling up to storm 
the Palace and free you, when your 
message reached me -" 

"How many reliable men do you 
have available on short notice, Your 
Highness?" Retief cut in. 

"I _have thirty-eight of the Invin-
cibles with me here. At least three 
others are under arrest on various 

THE PRINCE AND THE PIRATE 

pretext. Four more managed to re-
port in that they're pinned down by 
'protective escorts'. 
Retief shook his head. That wu 

the idea of arresting me, Your 
Highness -
as a personal affront to 
you, since my sympathies are weD 
known. Prouch wanted to bring you 
out into the open. An armed attack 
was just what he needed -
and lie 

was ready for you. He has. at least 
two hundred Greenbacks in the Pal-
ace, armed to the nines. Your raid 
would have been the signal of his 
take-over -
to preserve the domes-
tic 
tranquility, 
of 
course-
and your death in the fighting 
would have left him a clear field." 

"What about the Palace Guard? 
They haven't gone over?" 

"Of course not." Retief accepted 
a cigar, took a seat by the fire. 
"They're standing fast, playing it by 
ear. The Grand Ball tonight gave 
them an excuse for full dress, in-
cluding weapons, of course. The 
Greenbacks aren't quite ready to 
start anything with them -yet." 
T avilan stamped across the fire-
beast-hide rug. "Blast it, Retief 
we can't sit here and watch Prouch 
and his mob move in unopposed! If 
we hit them now- before they've 
had time to consolidate -" 

"-you'll get every Royalist sup-
porter in Elora City killed," Retief 
finished for him. Now, let's consi-
der the situation. Item: the Royal 
fleet is grounded, courtesy of CDT 
policy. Item two: Prouch's people's 
Volunteer Naval Reserve Detach-
ment of late-model Bogan destroy-
ers is sitting in its launch-cradles at 
Gray Valley, fifteen miles away." 

"They're no threat to us; they 
can't operate without fuel either." 

"They won't have to," Retief said, 
puffing out smoke. "Corps policy is 
nothing if not elastic. It seems that 
the Big Picture called for the sup-
plying of the Volunteer Reserve 
with full magazines-" 

"What!" 
"-and the topping off of an 

tanks." 

Tavilan's ruddy face paled. "I 

see," he said quietly, nodding. "The 
CDT talked disarmament to me 
while it was arming Prouch's revol-
utionaries. It never intended to see 
the monarchy survive." 

"Well, your Highness, the CDT is 
a very clean-minded organization, 
and it heard somewhere that 'mon-
archy' was a dirty word." 

"All right!" Prince Tavilan turned 
to Count Arrol. "We have mounts 
for 
every man- and plenty of 
crossbow bolts. There'll be Gt'een-
back blood on the palace floors be-
fore the night is out." 

"If I might make a sugges-

tion ... ?" 

"You're not 'tbvolved in this, Re-

tief. Take the CIJIII'er and get clear." 

"Clear to where? I've been dis-

owned 
by 
my 
colleagues 
and 
slapped in jail by the Prime Minis-
ter. To get back to the subject: I 
see no point in our riding into Elora 
City and being shot down at long 
range by Greenbacks." 

"We'll ride in at the Marivale 
Gate; move up through-" 

"If you'll pardon my saying so," 

ltetief said, "I've got a better idea. 
It's only fifteen miles to the Gray 
Valley." 

·"So?" 

"So I suggest we take a ride over 

there a.nd look at the Volunteer 
Navy." 

''You've just told me Prouch's 

renegades are armed to the teeth!" 

Retief nodded. "Since we need 

guns, Your Highness, I can't think 
of a closer place to get 'em·." 
At the head of the troop of 
thirty-eight riders, including 
General Hish, lashed to a mount, 
Retief and Tavilan reined in at the 
crest of the slope that faced the bar-
racks of the Peoples' Volunteer Na-
val Reserve, a blaze of light all 
across the narrow valley. On the 
ramp a quarter of a mile beyond 
the administrative and shop areas, 
ten slim destroyers loomed, bathed 
in the glare of poly-arcs. Prince 
Tavilan whistled. 

"Prouch and the CDT seem to 
have struck it off even better than 
I thought. That's all brand-new 
equipment." 

"Just defensive, of course," R.e-

tief said. "I believe Minister Prouch 
has given assurances that the elim-
ination of Dangredi's freebooters 
will be carried out with dispatch -
just as soon as the CDT recognizes 
his regime." 

Tavilan laughed shortly. "I could 
have swept Dangredi off the space 
Janes six months ago -if the CDT 
hadn't blockaded me." 

"Such are the vagaries of Galac-

tic policy." 

"I know, the Big Picture again." 
Tavilan turned to Arrol. "We'll split 
into two parties, work around both 
ends of the valley, and pick our tar-
get at close range. Retief, you ride 
with me. Let's move out." 

IF 

It was a 
the forested slopes walling the val-
ley to the rendevous point Prince 
Tavilan had designated, a sheltered 
ravine less than a hundred yards 
from the nearest of the parked war 
vessels. 
The 
access 
ladder 
was 
down, and light spilled from the 
open entry port. A Reservist in 
baggy gray and green lounged in 
the opening. Two more stood be-
low, power · rifles slung across their 
backs. 

"You could pick those three off 
from 
here," 
Retief 
remarked. 

"Crossbows are a nice quiet weap-
on." 

Tavilan shook his head. "We'll 

ride down in formal battle order. 
No war's been declared. They won't 
fire on the Prince Royal." 

"There may be forty more in-

aide -
to say nothing of the crews 

'ft+E PRINCE AND THf PIRATE 

of the next ships in line, sentrii".S, 
stand-by riot squads, and those two 
pillboxes commanding the ends of 
ne: valley." 

"Still -
I must give those men 
their chance to declare themselves." 

"As the Prince wishes. But I'll 
keep my blaster loose in its holster 
-just in case." 
T he Prince rode in the lead 
with his guidon at his left, fol-
lowed by thirty-five men, formed 
up in a precise triangle of seven 
ranks, 
with 
two 
formal 
honor 

guards out on the flanks. The rear-
guard followed, holding the reins of 
the mount to which General Hish, 
, still hissing bitter complaints, was 
' lashed. 
The Invincibles moved down the 

Slope and out onto the broad tar-

mac, hooves clattering 
a~a .1>1 the 

paved surface. The two men on the 
ramp turned and stood gaping. The 
one above at the ship's en~ry port 
whirled, disappeared inside. 
The troop rode on; they were 
halfway to the ship now. One of the 
waiting Greenbacks unlimbered his 
power gun, cranked the action; the 
other followed suit. Both stepped 
forward half a dozen paces, brought 
their weapons up uncertainly. 

"Halt! Who the hell's there?" one 
bawled. 
Tavilan flipped the corner of his 
hunting 
cape 
forward 
over 
his 
shoulder to show the royal Eloran 
device and came on in silence. 
The taller of the two Greenbacks 
raised his rifle,. hesitated, half -low-
ered it. Riding half a pace behind 
Tavilan, Retief eased his pistol from 
its holster, watching the doorway 
above. On his right, Count Arrol 
held his crossbow across his knee, a 
bolt cocked in the carriage, his fin-
ger on the trigger. 
Ten feet from the two Greenback 
sentries, Prince Tavilan reined in. 

"Aren't you men accustomed to 
render a proper salute when your 
commander makes a surprise in-
spection?" he asked mildly. 
The Greenbacks looked at each 
other, fingering their guns. 

"It looks as though the word has 
gone out," Arrol whispered to Re-
tief. 
· · 

At that moment a figure eased 
into view at the port; light glinted 
from the front sight of a power gun 
as it came up, steadied -
Retief sighted and fired. In the 
instantaneous blue glare, the man at 
the port whirled and fell outward.

The 
Greenback 
nearest 
Tavilan 
made a sudden move to swing his 
gun on the Prince- then stumbled 
back, a steel quarrel from Arrol's 
crossbow standing in his chest. The 
second 
Greenback 
dropped 
his 
weapon, stood with raised hands, his 
mouth open and eyes wide; then he 
turned and ran. 
Tavilan leaped down from his 
steed, dashed for the access ladder, 
his crossbow ready. 

"Everybody in," Arrol called. The 
men sprang up in good order; those 
waiting on the ramp faced outward, 
covering all points. From the adja-
cent vessel, a sharp report echoed. 
A man fell from the ladder; others 
caught him, lifted him up. Far 
away, a harsh voice bellowed orders. 

"They can't use any heavy stuff," 

Arrol said. "They wouldn't want to 
nick the paint on their new battle-
wagon." 

A squad of men appeared, run-

ning from the shadows at the base 
of the ship from which the firing 
had come. Most of the troop were 
up the ladder now; two men hus-
tled the struggling Groaci up. Be-
side Retief, Arrol launched three 
bolts in rapid-fire order. Two of the 
oncoming men fell. The blue flashes 
of power guns winked; here and 
there, the surface of the tarmac 
boiled as wild shots struck. 

"Come on!" The two men ran for 
the ladder; Arrol sprang for it, 
swarmed up. Retief followed. Mol-
ten metal spattered as a power-gun 
bolt vaporized the handrail. Then 
hands were hauling him safely in-
side the ship. 

"Hit the deck," Arrol yelled. 

"We're lifting!"

"We took one burst from an 
infinite repeater," an of-

ficer reported, "but no serious dam-
age was done. They held their fire 
just a little too long." 

"We were lucky," Prince Tavilan 
said. "One man killed, one wound-
ed. It's fortunate we didn't select the 
next ship in line. We'd have had a 
hornet's nest on our bands." 

"Too bad we broke up the batta-

lion crap game," Retief commented. 
"But by now they'll be lifting off 
after us- a few of them, anyway." 

"All right. We'll give them a 
warm welcome before they nail us." 

"If I may venture to suggest-" 
Tavilan waved a hand, grinning. 

"Every time you get so damned po-
lite, you've got 
some 
diabolical 
scheme up your sleeve. What is it 
this time, Retief?" 

"We won't wait around to be 
nailed. We'll drive for Deep Space 
at flank speed-" 

"And run into Dangredi's block-

ade? I'd· rather use my firepower 
on Prouch's scavengers." 

"That's where our friend the Gen-

eral comes in." Retief nodded to-
ward the truSsed Groaci. "He and 
Dangredi . are old business asso-
ciates. We'll put him on the screen 
and see if he can't negotiate a brief 
truce. With the approval of your 
Highness. I think we can make an 
offer that will interest him."

was a four - hundred - year -
old,

hundred thousand ton 
dreadnought, a relic of pre-Concor-
dia! times. 

THE PRINCE AND THE PIRATE 

In the red-lit gloom of its cav-

ernous Command Control deck, Re-
tief and Prince Tavilan relaxed in 
deep couches designed for the mas-
sive frames of the Hondu corsairs. 
Opposite them; Dangredi, the Hon-
du chieftain, lounged at ease, his 
shaggy, 
leather-strapped, . jewel-

spangled 
350-pound bulk 
almost 
overflowing his thronelike chair. At 
Retief's side, General · Hish perched 
nervously. Half a dozen of Tavilan's 
Invincibles stood around the room, 
chatting with an equal number of 
Dangredi's hulking officers, whose 
greenish fur looked black in the 
light from the crimson lamps. 

"What I failing to grasp," Dan-

gredi rumbled, "is reason for why 
suddenly now changing of plan pre-
viously okayed." 

"I hardly think that matters," Tav-

ilan said smoothly. "I've offered to 
add one hundred thousand Galactic 
Credits to the sum already agreed 
on." 

"But whole idea was compensate 
me, Grand Hereditary War Chief of 
Hondu people, for not fight. Now 
is offering more pay for stand and 
give battle." 

"I thought you Hondu loved war," 

an Eloran officer said. 
Dangredi nodded his heavy green-

furred head, featureless but for two 
wide green-pupilled eyes. 
"Crazy 

mad for warring, and also plenty 
fond of cash. But is smelling rodent 
somewhere in woodpile." 

"It's very simple, Commodore," 

Retief said. "General Hish here had 
arranged with you to flee when the 
People's Volunteer forces attacked. 
Now changing conditions on Elora 
make it necessary that you fight. 

And in place of the loot you w'-'u;J 
otherwise so rightly expect, you·u 
collect a handsome honorarium." 
Suddenly the Groaci leaped to his 
feet, pointed at Retief. "Commo-
dore Dangredi," he hissed. "This 
renegade diplomat beside me holds 
a gun pointed at my vitals. Only 
thus did he coerce me to request 
this parley. Had I guessed his inten-
tion, I would have dared him to 
do his worst. Seize the traitor, Ex-
cellency!" 

Dangredi stared at the Groaci. 
"He -
and these strutting popin-

jays -plot against the security of 
the People's State of Elora!" Hish 
whispered urgently. "The plan re-
mains unchanged! You are to flee 
engagement with the forces of Min-
ister Prouch!" 

The great green head bobbed 
suddenly; hooting laughter sounded. 
A vast hand slapped a thigh like a 
shaggy beer keg. 

"Aha! At last is getting grasp of 
situation," 
Dangredi 
bellowed. 

"Now is little honest treachery, kind 
of dealing Hondu understanding!" 
He waved a hand at a servitor stand-
ing by. "Bringing wassail bowl, plen-
ty meat!" He brought his hands to-
gether with a dull boom, rubbed 
them briskly. "Doublecross, plenty 
fighting, more gold at end of trail! 
Is kind of operation I, Dangredi, 
Hereditary War Chief, dreaming of 
in long nights of tooth-shedding 
time!". 

"But these -
these criminal kid-

nappers 
have 
no 
authority 
to 

deal-" 

"Groaci-napping is harmless pas-

time. 
Like 
stea)ing 
wine-melons 
when cub. Unless, maybe-" he 

cocked a large emerald eye at Hisb 
-
''you maybe raising ante?" 
"I ... I will match the offer of the 

saboteurs of interplanetary amityl 
One hundred thousand in Groac:i 
gold!" 

Dangredi considered briefly. "No 

good. What about fighting? You 
give 
Hondu 
gunners 
targets 
in 

sights? Or maybe chance for rough-
and-tumble hand-to-hand, cold steel 
against enemy blades?" 

General Hish shuddered. "In the 
name of civilization, I appeal-" 

"Shove civilization in ventral ori-
face! Hondu taking good, crooked, 
bloodthirsty barbarians every time. 
Now disappearing quietly, Groaci, 
while I and new buddies planning 
strategy. Maybe later I sending for 
you and bending arms and legs un-
til you tell all about enemy battle 
plan." 

"The Groaci is our hostage," Tav-

ilan said as the general was led 
away. "He's not to be bent without 
my prior approval." 

"Sure; just having little joke." 
Dangredi leaned back, accepted a 
vast drumstick and a tank of wine, 
waited while his guests were sup-
plied with delicacies. 

"Now, Retief, you say attack 

coming when ... ?" 
"I must 
confess," 
Counsellor 
Magnan said, "I don't quite 
understand how it llappened that af. 
ter trouncing the Eloran Volunteers, 
the pirate Dangredi voluntarily gave 
himself up and offered the services 
of his entire fleet as a reserve force 
to replace the very units he des-
troyed." 

"Never mind that, Magnan," Am-

IF 

bassador Hidebinder said. ··As sea-
soned campaigners must, we shall 
accept the fait accompli. Our reset-
tlement plans are set back a year, 
at least. It's doubly unfortunate that 
Prime Minister Prouch suffered a 
fall just at this time. Magnan, you'll 
attend the funeral." 

"With pleasure, Mr. Ambassa-

dor," Magnan said. "That is, I'll be 
honored." 

"Retief ... " 
Hidebinder 
glared 
across the table. "I'm not going to 
press civil charges, since the Eloran 
government, at the behest of Prince 
Tavilan, has 
dropped 
the 
case. 
However, I may as well tell you at 
once- your future with the Corps 
is non-existent. A trifling embezzle-
ment of official funds, I could wink 
at. Embellished reports, slack per-
formance of duty, cowardice in the 
face of the enemy- these I could 
shrug off as youthful peccadillos. 
But foot-dragging in the carrying 
out of my policy-" his fist thumped 
the desk. "Intolerable!" You openly 
allied yourself with-" 

A messenger entered the con-

ference room, handed a note to 
Magnan, who passed it to Hidebin-
der. 
He 
opened 
it 
impatiently, 
glanced at it. His jaw dropped. He 
read it through again. His mouth 

closed; his jowls paled, qutvennc::. 

"Mr. Ambassador- what is 1t?" · 

Magnan gasped. 
Hidebinder 
rose 
and 
tottered 
from the room. Magnan snatched 
up the paper, read it through, then 
stared at Retief. 

"He's been declared persona non 

grata! 
The 
Imperial government 
gives him twelve hours · to ·leave 
Elora!" 

Retief glanced at the. wall clock. 

"If he hurries, he can catch the mail 
boat." 

"And you, Retief ... " 
Retief raised his eyebrows. 
Magnan glanced around the ta-

ble. "If you gentlemen will excuse us 
for a few moments?" 

Half a dozen frowning diplomats 
filed 
from 
the 
room. 
Magnan 
cleared his throat. "This is most ir-
regular, Retief! The Imperial gov-
ernment requests that you present 
credentials as Minister Plenipoten-
tiary and Ambassador Extraordin-
ary at once! They will accept no 
other appointee." 
Relief asked. "I told Prince Tavi-

lan I wouldn't have time for a cere-
monial job. I have a suggestion. Mr. 
Magnan. Suppose I nominate you 
for the post?"

"Over the heads of a hundred

Magnan · gasped. 

"Retief, dear boy . . ." 

"That is, if your distaste for mon-
archies isn't overwhelming?" 

"Eh? Oh, well, as to that," Mag-
nan sat erect, tugged his lapels into 
place "I've always had a sneaking 
admiration for absolute royalty." 

"Fine. Dangredi will be along in 
a few minutes to arrange for sup-
plies. It seems there are a few ship-
loads of CDT - sponsored undesir-
ables already landing on the north-
ern continent who'll have to be 
warned off. It's probably just a slip. 
I'm sure our former ambassador 
wouldn't have jumped the gun in 
violation of solemn treaties." 

"Ah," Magnan said. 
"And, of course, the Royal Navy 

will require provisioning -
just to 
be sure the new Reservists don't get 
any large ideas." 

"Uh .. . " 

"And, of course, a new treaty 
plainly guaranteeing the territorial 
integrity of Elora will have to be 
worked up at once." 

"Oh .. . " 
Retief rose. "All of which I'm 
sure you'll handle brilliantly, Mr. 
Ambassador. And by the way- I 
think I could best serve the mission 
in some other capacity than as Ad-
min Officer." 

Magnan pulled at his collar, wait-
ing . . . 

"I think I'd better work closely 
with Prince Tavilan, the heir appar-
ent," Retief said blandly. "He does 
a lot of hunting, so perhaps you'd 
better designate me as Field and 
Stream Attache." He picked up his 
crossbow which was in the corner 
of the room. 

"I leave the details to you, Mr. 
Ambassador. I'm going to do some 
hunting."

THE 
LIFE HATER 

BY FRED SABERHAGEN 

The berserker machine was built 
to destroy life. Carr's mission 
was to teach it to be a friend/ 

Carr swallowed a pain pill, and 
tried to find a less uncomfort-
able position in the combat chair. 
He keyed his radio transmitter and 
spoke to the rogue ship that hung 
before him in space. 

"I come in peace. I have no weap-
ons. I come to talk to you." 

He waited. The cabin of his little 
one-man ship was silent. His radar 
screen showed the berserker machine 
still many light-seconds ahead of 
him. There was no reaction from it, 
but he knew that it had heard him. 
Behind Carr was the Sol-type star 
he called sun, and his home planet, 
colonized from Earth a century be-
fore. It was a lonely settlement. out 
near the rim of the galaxy. Until 
now the war waged on life by the 

berserker macbinea bad been a rC4 
mote horror in the news stories. 
The colony's only real fighting ship 
had been sent to join Karlsen's fleet 
in the defense of Earth, when the 
berserkers were said to be massing 
there. But now the enemy was here, 
and the people of Carr's planet were 
readying two more ships ia fe.verish 
haste- they were a small colony, 
and not wealthy in resources. Ev~n 
when the two ships were ready, they 
would hardly be a match for a ber-
serker. 
When Carr had taken his plan to 
the leaders of the colony, they had 
thought him mad. 
Go out and talk to it of peace 
and love? Argue with it? There might 
be some hope of converting the most 

depraved human to the cause of 
goodness and mercy, but what ap-
peal could alter the built-in purpose 
of a machine? 

"Why not talk: to it of peace?" 

Carr had demanded. "Have you a 
. better plan? I'm willing to go, I've 
nothing to lose." 

They had looked at him, across 
the gulf that separates healthy plan-
ners from those who know they are 
dying. They thought almost any 
scheme would be better than his. 
But they could imagine nothing else 
to do until the warships were ready, 
·which would be at least ten days. 
The little one-man ship was expend-
able, 
being unarmed. Armed, it 
would be no more a provocation to 
a berserker. In the end, they let 
Carr take it, hoping there was a 
chance his arguments might delay 
the inevitable attack. 
For Carr himself, of course, they 
wasted no thought. For Carr was 
dying. Was as good as dead. 
W hen Cur came within a mil-

lion miles of the berserker, 
it stopped its own unhurried motion 
and seemed to wait for him, hang-
ing in space in the orbital track of 
an airless planetoid, at a poiat from 
which the planetoid was still sev-
eral days away. 

"I am unarmed," he radioed 
again. "I come to talk with you, not 
to damage you. H those who built 
you· were here, I would try to talk 
to them of peace and love. Do you 
understand?" 
He felt sure it would understand 
his language. All the berserker ma-
chines had learned the universal 

a6 

space-travelers' tongue, from human 
prisoners or from each other. And 
he was serious about talking love to 
the unknown Builders. Grudges and 
vengeance seemed tiny things to a 
dying man. But the Builders would 
not be aboard; the berserkers had 
been constructed, probably, when 
Earthmen hunted the mammoth with 
spears. The Builders were lost in 
spacetime, along with their enemies 
of long ago. 
Suddenly it answered him: "Little 

ship, maintain your present speed 
and course toward me. Be ready to 
stop when ordered. " 
"I- I will." In spite of being 
ready for it, Carr found himself 
stuttering and shaken at the sound 
of its voice, the uneven mechanical 
reproduction of the words of human 
prisoners, recorded aboard or bor-
rowed from another machine. Now 
the weapons which could sterilize a 
planet would be trained on him 
alone. And there was worse than de-
struction to be feared, if one tenth 
of the stories about berserkers' pris-
oners were true. Carr did not let 
himself think about that -
although 
the pain that racked ·him in momen-
tary flood, of agony made death 
seem almost welcome. 
When he was within ten thousand 
miles it ordered: "Stop. Wait where 
you are, relative to me." 

Carr obeyed instantly. Soon he 
saw that it had launched toward 
him something about the size of his 
own ship -
a little moving dot on 
his video screen, coming out of the 
vast black fortress 
that floated 
against the stars. 
Even at this range he could see 

U' 

how scarred and battered that fort-
ress was. He had heard that all of 
these ancient machines were dam-
aged, from their long senseless fight-
ing across the galaxy; but surely 
such apparent ruin as this must be 
exceptional. 
The berserker's launch slowed and 
drew up beside his ship. Soon there 
came a clanging at the airlock. 

"Open!" 
demanded 
the 
radio 
voice. "I must search you." 

"Then you will listen to me?" 
"Then I will listen." 
He opened the lock, and stood 
aside for the half dozen machines 
that entered. They were not unlike 
robot valets and workers, except 
that these were old and limping and 
worn, like their great master. Here 
and there a new part gleamed. But 
often the machines' movements were 
unsteady as they searched Carr, 
searched his cabin, probed every-
where on the little ship. One of them 
had to be half-carried out by its 
fellows, when the search was com-
pleted. 
Another one of the machines, a 
thing with arms and hands like a 
man's, stayed behind. As soon as 
the lock had closed behind the oth-
ers, it settled itself in the combat 
chair and began to drive the ship 
toward the berserker. 

"Wait!" Carr protested. "I didn't 
surrender!" The ridiculous words 
hung in the air, seeming to deserve 
no reply. Sudden panic made Carr 
move without thinking; he stepped 
forward and grabbed at the mech-
anical pilot, trying to pull it from 
the chair. It put one metal hand 
against his chest and shoved him 

THE LIFE HATER 

across the cabin, so that he 
stag~­

gered and fell in the artificial grav-
ity, thumping his head painfully 
against a bulkhead. "In a matter of 
minutes we will talk about love and 
peace," said the radio voice. 
L ooking out a port as his ship 
neared the immense berserker, 
Carr saw the scars of battle become 
plainer and plainer, ·even to his un-
practiced eye. There were holes in 
the hull, square miles of bendings 
and swellings and pits where the 
metal bad once flowed molten. 
Rubbing his bumped head, Carr 
felt a faint thrill of pride. We've 
done that to it, he thought, we soft 
little living things. His own martial 
feeling annoyed him, in a way. He 
had always been something of a 
pacifist. Of course it could hardly 
be thought immoral to use violence 
against a dangerous but inanimate 
machine. After some delay, a hatch 
opened in the berserker's side, and 
Carr's ship followed the berserker's 
. launch into darkness. 
Now there was nothing to be seen 
through the port. Soon there came a 
gentle bump, as of docking. The 
mechanical pilot shut off the drive, 
turned toward Carr and started to 
rise from the chair. 
Something in it failed. Instead of 
rising smoothly, the pilot reared up, 
flailed for a moment with arms 
that sought a grip or balance, and 
then fell heavily to the deck. For 
half a minute it moved one arm, 
and made a grinding noise. Then 
it was still. 
In the half minute of silence 
which followed, Carr realized that 

he was again master ,1, 
illS cabin: 
chance had given him that. lf there 
was something he could do -

"Leave your ship," said the calm 
voice. "There is an airfilled tube fit-
ted to your airlock. It will lead you 
to a place where we can talk of 
peace and love." 

Carr's eyes, with a sort of reluct-
ant horror, had dragged themselves 
to focus on the engine switch, and 
beyond that, to the C-plus activator. 
The C-plus jump was not usable 
as a drive anywhere near the huge 
mass of a sun. In such proximity as 
this to a mass even the size of the 
surrounding berserker, the effect 
became only a weapon -
a weapon 
of tremendous potential power. 
Carr did not- or thought he did 
not- any longer fear sudden death; 
he was too near to the slow, sure 
kind. But now he found that with all 
his heart and soul he feared what 
might be prepared for him outside 
the 3.irlock. All the horror stories 
came back. The thought of going . 
out through that airlock now was 
unendurable. It was less terrifying for 
him to step carefully around the 
fallen pilot, to reach the controls and 
turn the engine back on. 

"I can talk to you from here," he 
said, his voice quavering in spite 
of an effort to keep it steady. 
After about ten seconds, the ber-

serker said: '·'Your C-plus drive has 
safety devices. You will not be able 
to kamikaze me." 

"You may be right," said Carr af-

ter a moment's thought. "But if a 
safety device does function, it might 
hurl my ship away from your center 
of mass, right through your hull. 

And your hull is in bad shape now. 
You don't want any more damage." 

"You would die." 
"I'll have to die sometime. But I 
didn't come out here to die, or to 
fight. I came to talk with you, to 
try to reach some agreement." 

"What kind of agreement?" 
At last Carr took a deep breath, 
and marshaled the arguments he 
had so often rehearsed. He kept his 
fingers resting gently on the C-plus 
activator, and his eyes alert on the 
instruments that normally monitored 
the hull for micrometeorite damagl'. 

"I've had the feeling," he began, 

"that your attacks upon humanity 
may be only some ghastly mistake. 
Certainly we were not your original 
enemy." 

"Life is my enemy. Life is evil." 

Pause. "Do you want to become 
good life?" 
Carr closed his eyes for a mo-

ment; some of the horror stor-
ies were coming to life. But then 
he went firmly on with his argu-
ment. "From our point of view, it 
is you who are bad. We would like 
you to become a good machine, 
one that helps men instead of kill-
ing. Is not building a higher purpose 
than destroying?" 
There was a longer pause. "What 

evidence can you offer that I should 
change my purpose?" 

"For one thing, :belping us will 
be a purpose easier of achievement. 
No one will damage you and op-
pose you." 

"What is it to me, if I am dam-
aged and opposed?" 

Carr tried again. "Life is basical-

IF 

)J superior to non-life; and mas is 
the highest form of life." 

"What evidence do you offer?" 
"Man has a spirit." 
"I have learned that men claim 
that. But do you not define this 
apirit as something beyond the per-
ception of any machine? And are 
there not men who deny that this 
spirit exists?" 

"Spirit is so defined. And there 
are such men." 

"Then I do not accept the argu-

ment of spirit." 

Carr dug out a pain pill and swal-

lowed it. "Still, you have no evi-
dence that spirit does not exist. You 
must consider it as a possibility." 

"That is correct." 
"But leaving spirit out of the 
argument for now, consider the phys-
ical and chemical organization of 
life. Do you know anything of the 
delicacy and intricacy or organiza-
tion in even a single living cell? And 
surely you must admit we humans 
carry wonderful computers. inside 
our few cubic inches of skull." 

"I have never had an intelligent 
captive to dissect," the mechanical 
voice informed him blandly, "though 
I have received some relevant data 
from other machines. But you admit 
that your' form is the determined re-
sult of the operation of physical 
and chemical laws?" 

"Have you ever thought that those 
laws may have been designed to 
do just that -produce brains cap-
able of intelligent action?" 

There was a pause that stretched 
on and on. Carr's throat felt dry 
and rough, as if he had been speak-
ing for hours. 

THE LIFE HATER 

"I have never tried to use that 
hypothesis," it answered suddenly. 
"But if the construction of intelli-
gent life is indeed so. intricate, so 
dependent upon the laws of physics 
being as they are and not otherwise 
-then to serve life may be 
th~ 

highest purpose of a machine." 

"You may be sure, our physical 
construction is intricate." He wasn't 
sure he could follow the machine's 
line of reasoning, but that hardly 
mattered if he could somehow win 
the game of Life. He kept his fin· 
gers on the C-plus activator. 
The berserker said: "If I am able 
to study some living cells -" 

Like a hot iron on a nerve, the 
meteorite-damage indicator moved; 
something was at the hull. "Stop 
that!" he screamed, without thought. 
"The first thing you try, I'll kill 
you!" 
I ts voice was unevenly calm, as al-

ways. "There may have been 
some accidental contact with your 
bull. I am damaged and many of my 
commensal machines are unreliable. 
I mean to land on this approaching 
planetoid to mine for metal and re-
pair myself as far as possible." The 
indicator was quiet again. 
The berserker resumed its argu-

ment. "If I am able to study some 
living cells from an intelligent life-
unit for a few hours, I expect I will 
find· strong evidence for, or against, 
your argument. Will you provide me 
with cells?" 

"You must have had prisoners, 

sometime." He said it as a suspicion; 
be really knew no reason why it 
must have bad human captives. It 

could have learned the language 
from another. berserker. 

"No, I have never taken a prison-

er." 

It waited. The question it had 
asked still hung in the air. 

"The only human cells on this 
ship are my own. Possibly I could 
give you a few of them." 

"Half a cubic centimeter should 
be enough; not a dangerous loss for 
you, I believe. I will not demand part 
of your brain. Also I understand 
that you wish to avoid the sensation 
called pain. I am willing to help you 
avoid it, if possible." 

Did it want to drug him? That 
seemed too simple. Always unpre-
dictability, the stories said, and 
sometimes a subtlety out of hell. 
He went on with the game. "I 

have all that is necessary. Be warn-
ed that my attention will hardly 
waver from the control panel. Soon 
I will place a tissue sample in the 
airlock for you." 

He got the medical kit, took two 
pain-killers, and set very carefully 
to work with a sterile scalpel. He 
had had some biological training. 
When the small wound was ban-
daged, he cleansed the tissue sample 
of blood and lymph and with un-
steady fingers sealed it into a little 
tube. 
Without letting 
down his 
guard for an instant, he dragged the 
fallen pilot to the airlock .and left 
it there with the tissue sample. Ut-
terly weary, he got back to the com-
bat chair. 
When he switched the 
outer door open, he heard something 
come into the lock, and leave again. 
He took a pep pill. It would stim-
ulate some pain, but he'd be alert. 

Two hours passed. Carr forced 
himself to eat some emergency ra-
tions, watched the panel, and waited. 
He gave a startled jump when the 
berserker spoke again; nearly six 
hours had gone by. 

"You are free to leave," it was 
saying. "Tell the leading life-units of 
your planet that when I have refit-
ted, I will be their ally. The study of 
your cells has convinced me that the 
human body is the highest creation 
of the universe, and that I should 
make helping you my purpose. Do 
you understand?" 

Carr felt numb. "Yes. Yes ' 
have convinced you. After you have 
refitted, you will fight on our side." 

Something shoved 
hugely 
and 
gently at his hull. Through a port he 
saw stars, and realized that the great 
hatch through which his ship had 
entered was swinging open. 

·This far within the system, Carr 
necessarily kept his ship in nor-
mal space to travel. It meant he 
could see the berserker as he fled 
from it, and he kept it in sight as 
long as possible. His last sight of the 
berserker showed it moving as if 
indeed about to let down upon the 
airless planetoid. Certainly it was 
not following him. 
A couple of hours after being 
freed, he roused himself from con-
templation of the radar screen, and 
went to spend a full minute con-
sidering the inner airlock door. At 
last he shook his head, dialed air 
into the lock, and entered it. The 
pilot was gone, with the tissue sam-
ple. There was nothing strange to 
be seen. Carr took a deep breath, 

IF 

as if relieved, closed up the lock 
again, and went to a port to spend 
··some time watching the stars. 
After a day he began to deceler-

ate, so that when hours had added 
into another day, he was still a good 
distance from home. He ate, and 
slept, and watched his face in a mir· 
ror. He weighed himself, and he 
watched the stars some more, with 
great interest, like a man examining 
something long forgotten. 
In two more days, gravity bent his 
course into a hairpin ellipse around 
his home planet. With his whole 
world bulking between him and the 
berserker's rock, Carr began to use 
his radio. 

"Ho, on the ground! Good news." 
The answer came almost instant-
ly. "We've been tracking you, Carr. 
What's going on't What happened?" 

He told them of his encounter 
with the berserker. "So that's the 
story up to now," he finished. "I ex-
pect the thing really needs to refit. 
It is seriously damaged. Two war-
ships attacking it now should easily 
win." 

"Yes." There was excited talk in 
the background. Then the voice was 
back, sounding uneasy. "Carr-you 
haven't 
started 
a 
landing 
ap-

proach yet, so maybe you under-
stand. We've got to be careful. The 
thing was probably lying to you." 

"Oh, I know. Even that pilot's 
collapse might have been staged. I 
guess the berserker was too badly 
shot up to want to risk a battle, so 

it tried another way. 
Must have 
sneaked the stuff into my cabin air, 
just before it let me go -
or maybe 

left it in my airlock." 

"What stuff?" 
Carr said, "The stuff you're wor-

rying about. The poison it thinks 
will kill us all. I'd guess it's some 
freshly mutated virus, designed for 
specific virulence against the tissue 
I gave it. It expected I'd hurry home 
and land before getting sick, and 
spread a new plague. It must have 
thought it was inventing biological 
warfare, using life against life, as we 
use machines against machines. But 
it needed that tissue sample to blood 
its pet viruses. It didn't know our 
chemistry. It must have been telling 
the truth about never having a hu-
man prisoner." 

"Some virus, you think? What's 
it doing to you, Carr? Are you in 
pain-I mean, more than before?" 

"No." Carr swirled his chair to 
look at the little chart he had be-
gun. It showed that in the last two 
days his weight loss had started to 
reverse itself. He looked down at his 
body, at the bandaged place near the 
center of a discolored, inhuman-look-
ing area. That area was smalled than 
it had been, and he saw a hint of 
new and healthy skin. 

"What is the stuff doing to you?" 
Carr allowed himself to smile, 
and to speak aloud his growing 
hope. 

"I think it's killing off my cancer."

What Has Gone Before ••• 

HUGH FARNHAM, building contractor, head of a hous&o 

hold and dedicated bridge player, is spending a quiet weekend 
in his home while the world hovers on the brink of disaster. His 
son, 

DUKE, refuses to take the crisis seriously but grudgingly 

admits the wisdom of Farnham's construction of a bomb shelter 
-radiation proof, blast proof, self-contained as to air, food and 
water. Farnham's wife, 

GRACE, takes no part in the argument-or in any argu-
ment, for it has been years since Grace Farnham felt needed and 
important enough to justify her role in the household and she has 
sunk into a sort of cheerful, alcoholic apathy. Their daughter, 

KAREN, a college student, is home for the weekend and has 
brought with her a schoolmate, 

BARBARA WELLS, a girl of twenty. The other person in 
the household is the houseboy, 

JOSEPH, a young Negro whose position in the family is part 
servant, part substitute son for Hugh Farnham. After dinner they 
settle down to a few rubbers of bridge-interrupted by a sudden, 
sneak nuclear attack. The war that all have both feared and dis-
believed in ... has begun. 

After a night of terror and discomfort in the shelter, the 
six survivors emerge and find themselves in a world they do not 
recognize. There is no sign of bomb damage, except the twisted 
shell of their shelter-but neither is there any sign of the homes, 
the roads, the cities that had been all around them. They are 
alone in a wilderness. Months pass, during which Karen dies and 
Hugh and Barbara find themselves in love. Then, without warn-
ing, a strange duster of flying machines drop toward them out 
of the sky. They have been found-but by whom? 

flagpole. They all now could see 
that there were people on it; several 
heads showed above its low sides. 
A corner detached itself from the 
rectangle, splitting off sharply. It 
dove and stopped in the air by the 
peak of the flag pole. Hugh saw that 
it was a separate car, perhaps nine 
feet long and three feet wide, with 
one passenger, or pilot. Still no de-
tails could be seen, no clue to mo-
tive power. The car enclosed the 
lower part of the man's body; his 
trunk, arms, and head projected 
above. Hugh was reminded of a 
horse and rider, or possibly an Eski-
mo in a kayak. 
The man removed the flag from 
the pole, rejoined the main craft. 
His vehicle blended back in, filling 
its corner; no seam remained. 
The rectangle in the air suddenly 
disintegrated. 
It broke into separate units like 

llbat one which had detached itself 
to filch their flag. Mo9t of them re-
mained in the air; some dozen or 
90 landed, three of them in a triangle 
around the group of colonists. Duke 
yelled, "Watch it!" and dived for his 
gun on the ground. 
H e 
~ever made it. Instead he 
leaned forward at a curious 
angle as if he were balancing against 
a heavy roll of a ship. He pawed the 
air with an expression of amazement 
and slowly was pulled back to ver-
tical. 
Barbara gasped in Hugh's ear. 

"Hugh, what is it?" 

"I don't know." He did not have 
to ask what she meant; he had sud-
denly felt, at the same time his 90n 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

was stopped, that he seemed to be 
standing 
waist deep in invisibJ. 

quicksand. "Don't fight it." 

"I wasn't going to." 
Grace shrilled, "Hubert! Hubert, 
do 90me -
" Her cries cut off. 
Then she seemed to faint but did 
not fall. 
. 
Four of the boxlike individual can 

were six or eight feet in the air, 
lined up abreast, and were slowly 
cruising over the most level part of 
the clearing, Barbara's farm. Where 
they passed, everything underneath, 
corn stalks, tomato plants, beans, 
squash, lettuce, potato hills, every-
thing including branching irrigation 
ditches, was leveled, pressed flat 
into a 90rt of macadam. 
The raw end of the main ditch 
spilled water over this new pavement. 
One of the cars whipped around 
to that point, ran a new and deeper 
ditch around the raped area in a 
wide sweep of several hundred yards 
which allowed the ditch water to 
circle around the destroyed garden 
and reach the stream at a new point 
lower down. 
Barbara buried her face against 

Hugh's shoulder. He patted her 
The car that had made the by. 
pass ditch went upstream along th~ 
old ditch. Sooa the water ceased to 
flow at all. 
As fast as the garden was leveled 
other cars landed on it. Hugh was 
unable to figure out just what they 
did or how they did it, but a large 
pavilion, glossy black and ornately 
decorated in red and gold, grew up 
in seconds in the clearing. 
Duke called out, "Dad! For God's 

sake, can't you get at your gun?" 

Hugh was wearing a forty-five, 
the only weapon he had planned to 
take on the hike. He had already dis-
covered that his hands were only 
slightly hampered by whatever held 
them. But he answered, "I shari't 
try." 

"Are you going to just stand there 
and let-" 

"Yes. Duke, use your head. If we 
hold still and don't fight, we may 
live longer. We'll try to parley." 

Out of the pavilion strode a man. 
He seemed to be almost seven feet 
tall but some of this height was a 
helmet, plumed and burnished. He 
wore a flowing skirt of red embroid-
ered in gold and was bare from the 
waist up save that an end of the 
skirt was thrown back across one 
shoulder such that it covered, diag-
onally, part of his broad chest. He 
was shod in black boots. 
All other men who had passed 
close enough to be seen were 
dressed in black coveralls with a red 
and gold patch at the right shoulder. 
Hugh felt an impression that this 
man (there was no slightest doubt 
that he was master) -
that the big 
man, the boss, the commander, had 
taken his time to change into more 
formal clothes. Hugh was encour-
aged by this. Unquestionably they 
were prisoners -
but if the leader 

took the trouble to dress up be-
fore interviewing them, then it fol-
lowed that they were prisoners of 
some importance and a parley might 
be fruitful. Or did that follow? 
· But he was encouraged by the 
man's visage as well as his clothes. 
He had an air of good-natured, jov-
ial arrogance and his eyes were 

bright and merry. His forehead was 
high and his skull massive; he looked 
intelligent and alert. Hugh could 
not place his race. All the skin that 
showed, from his waist up, was dark, 
smooth brown and as shiny as if he 
oiled it. But his mouth was only 
slightly Negroid, his nose, though 
broad, was arched, and his black 
hair was wavy. 
He carried a small crop, or whip, 
or swagger stick, but no weapons. 
He strode up to them, stopped 
abruptly when he reached Jo-

seph. He gave some curt order to the 
nearest of their three captors. 
Joe stretched and bent his legs. 

"Thanks." 

The man spoke to Joe. Joe an-

swered, "Sorry, I don't understand." 
The 
man 
spoke 
again. 
Joe 
shrugged helplessly. The man grin-
ned and patted him on the moulder, 
turned away, picked up the rifle 
Duke had tried for. He handled it 
clumsily, making Hugh flinch at his 
apparent ignorance of, or indiffer-
ence to, safety precautions about 
where to point the muzzle of a gun. 
Nevertheless he seemed to under-

stand guns. He worked the bolt, 
ejecting one cartridge, then put it to 
his shoulder with passable form, 
aimed at a point and fired. 
The blast was deafening. He had 
fired right past Hugh's ear. 
He grinned broadly, tossed the 
rifle to one of his subordinates, 
walked up to Hugh and Barbara, 
reached out to touch Barbara's child-
swollen belly. 
Hugh knocked his hand away. 
With a gesture almost negligent, 

IF 

certainly without anger, the big man 
brushed Hugh's hand aside with 
the crop he carried. It was not a 
blow, it would barely have swatted 
a fly. 
Hugh gasped in agony. His hand 
burned like fire and his arm was 
numb to the armpit. "Oh, God!" 

Barbara said urgently, "Don't, 

Hugh. Let him. He isn't hurting 
me." 

Nor 
was he. With a manner 
which showed only impersonal in-
terest as a veterinarian might take 
in feeling a pregnant mare or bitch, 
the big man felt out the shape of 
the child she carried- while Hugh 
writhed in that special humiliation 
of a man unable to protect his wom-
an. 
The big man finished, grinned at 
Barbara and patted her head. Hugh 
tried to ignore the pain in his hand 
and dug into his memory for a 
language imperfectly learned. "Vooi 
govoriti'yeh po-Russki, Gospodin?" 

The man glanced at him, made no 
answer. 
Barbara said, "Sprechen sie deut-
sch, mein Herr?" 

That got her a smile, nothing 
more. Hugh called out, "Duke, try 
him in Spanish!" 

"Okay,. l Halbla usted Espanol, 

Senor'!" No responss. 

Hugh sighed. "We've shot our 

wad." 

"1\l'sicur?" Joe said. "Est-ce que 
vous parlez Ia langue francaise?" 

The man suddenly turned and 
faced Joseph. "Tiens?" 

"Parlez-vous francais, monsieur?" 
"1\fais oui! Vous etes francaises?" 
"i•:on. non! Je suis americain. 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

Noua sommes tous americains." 

"Vraiment? Impossible!" 
"C'est vrai, monsieur. Je vous en 

assure." Joe pointed to the peak of 
the empty flag pole. "Les Etats-Unis 
de 1' Amerique." 
The 
conversation became less 

easy to follow as both sides stumbled 
along in broken French. ia least 
they paused and Joe said, ""Hugh, 
he has asked me- ordered me, I 
1!bink -
to come with him into his 

tent and talk. I've asked him to let 
you all loose first. He says No. 'Hell, 
no!' it amounts to." 

"Ask him to let the women loose." 
"I'll try." Joe spoke at some 
length with the big man. "He says 
the enceinte femme- that's Bar-
bara- can sit down where she is. 
But the 'fat one' -Grace he means 
-is to come along with us." 

"Good enough. Good work, Joe. 
Get us a deal." 

"I'll try. I don't understand him 
very well." 
T he three went into the pavilion. 
Barbara found that she could 
sit down, even stretched out which 
Hugh urged her to do. But the in-
visible web held Hugh as clingingly 
as ever even though she was right 
next to him. 

"Dad," Duke said urgently, "this 

is our chance to make plans, while 
nobody is around who understands 
English." 

"Duke," Hugh answered wearily, 

"can't you see they hold all the 
trumps? It's my guess that we are 
alive as long as he isn't annoyed 
with us-- and not oDe minute long-
er." 

"Aren't you even going to try to 

fight? Where's all that talk you used 
to giva me about bow you were a 
free man and planned to stay free?" 

Hugh 
rubbed 
his 
hurt hand. 

"Duke, I'm not going to argue. You 
start anything now and you'll get 
us all killed. That's how I size it 
up." 

"So it was just talk?" Duke said 
scornfully. "Well, I'm not making 
any promises." 

"All right, all right. Drop it." 
"I'm still not making any prom-

ises. Just tell me one thing, Dad. 
How does it feel to be shoved 
around? Instead of doing the shov-
ing?" 

"I don't like it." 
"Neither did L And I've never 
forgotten it. I hope you get your 
bellyful of it." 

Barbara said, "Duke, for heaven's 
sake, stop talking like a fool!" 
Duke looked a.t her. "I'll shut up. 
Just tell me one thing. Where did 
you get that baby in you?" 

Barbara did not answer. Hugh 
said quietly, "Duke, if we get out 
of this, I promise you a beating for 
that remark." 

"Any time, old man, any time." 
They quit talking. Barbara reached 
out and patted Hugh's ankle. Four 
or five of the uniformed men gath-
ered around the pile of household 
objects, picked through them, look-
ing them over. A man whose man-
ner· spelled petty officer came up 
and gave them an order; they dis-
persed. He looked at some of the 
objects himself, then peered into 
the shelter and went inside. 
Hugh heard a sound of rushing 

water, looked and saw a brown wave 
rushing down the stream bed. Bar-
bara raised her head and asked, 
"What is that?" 

"Our dam is gone. It doesn't mat-

ter." 

After a long time Joe came out 

of the pavilion alone. He came up 
to Hugh and said, "Well, here's the 
scoop, as nearly as I can get it. Not 
too near, maybe; he speaks some sort 
of patois and neither one of us ia 
really fluent anyhow. But here it is. 
We're trespassers, this is private 
land. He also figured that we were 
escaped 
prisoners -
the 
word 
ia 

something else, not French, but 
that's the idea. I've convinced him 
-
I think I've convinced him -

tha1 we are perfectly i~nocent people 
brought here through no fault of 
our own. 

"Anyhow, he's not mad at us, 
even though we are technically crim-
inals -
trespass, and planting things 
where farms aren't supposed to be 
and building a dam and a house and 
things like that. He's not really sore 
and I think everything is going to 
be all right -
as long as we do as 
we are told. He finds us interesting 
-how we got here and so forth." 
Joe stopped and looked at Bar-

bara. "You remember that theory 
that you had about parallel uni-
verses?" 

"Certainly. I guess I was right. 

No?" 

"No." Joe shook his head. "This 

part is as confused as can be and I 
didn't understand it. But one thing 
is absolutely sure. Barbara, Hugh -
Duke, get this! This is our own 
world, right here." 

U' 

D uke said, "Joe, that's prepo~ter­

ous." 

"You argue it with him. He's con-
vinced me. He knows what I mean 
by the United States, he 
knows 
where France is. And so forth. No 
question about it." 

"Well-" Duke 
paused. 
"As 

may 
be. 
But what about this? 
Where's my mother? What's the idea 
of leaving her in there with that 
savage?" 

"She's all right, she's having lunch 
with him. And she's enjoying it. 
Just let it run easy, Duke, and we're 
going to be okay, I think. Soon as 
they finish lunch we'll be leaving." 

A few minutes later Hugh helped· 

Barbara climb into the•back of one 
of the odd flying machines, then 
mounted into one himself, behind 
the pilot. He found the seat comfort-
able and, in place of a safety belt, 
a field of that invisible quicksand 
enclosed the lower part of his body 
as he sat down. His pilot, a young 
Negro who looked remarkably like 
Joe, glanced back then took off with 
neither noise nor fuss and joined his 
car into the reforming rectangle in 
the air. Hugh saw that perhaps half 
the small cars had passengers; the 
passengers were whites, the pilots 
were invariably colored, ranging 
from as light brown as a Javanese 
to as sooty black as a Fiji Islander. 
The car he was in was half way 
back and in the outside starboard 
rank of the formation. He looked 
around, spotting where each of the 
others had wound up, and was only 
mildly surprised to see that Grace 
was riding behind the boss man, in 
the front rank, middle position. Joe 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

was behind them, rather muchly 
buried in cats. 

Off to his r.ight, two cars had not 
joined up. One hovered over the 
pile of household goods, gathered 
them up in a non-existent cargo net, 
moved away. The second car posi-
tioned itself directly over the shel-
ter. 
· 

The massive concrete block lifted, 
steadily, straight up, aO:d on an even 
keel, without disturbing the shack 
on its roof. The small car and its 
giant burden took position about 
fifty feet off the starboard side. The 
entire formation moved forward and 
gathered speed but Hugh felt no 
wind of motion. The little car flank-
ing them seemed to have no struggle 
keeping up despite its giant burden. 
Hugh could not see the ot'her loaded 
car but assumed that it was on the 
port side. 
The last he saw of their home was 
a bare scar where the shelter had 
rested, a larger scar where Barbara's 
farm had been, and a meandering 
track that used to mark an irriga-
tion ditch. 
He looked away and rubbed his 
sore hand, reflecting that the whole 
thing had been a gross abuse of 
coincidence. It offended him the way 
a hand of thirteen spades in a puta-
tively honl!st deal would. offend him. 
He pondered a remark Joe had made 
just before they had loaded: "We 
were incredibly lucky to have en-
countered a scholar. French is a 
dead language -
'une langue per-
due,' he called it." . 
Hugh craned his neck back to 
the lef.t, caught Barbara's eye. She 
smiled at him. 

XI 
M emtok, Chief Palace Domestic 
to the Lord Pl'otector of the 
Noonday Region, was busy and 
happy- happy because he was busy, 
although he was not aware that he 
was happy and was giYen to com-
plaining about how hard he had to 
work, all because, as he put it, 
although he commanded some eigh-
teen hundred servants there were not 
three of them who could be trusted 
to empty a &lop jar without close 
supervision. 
He had just completed a pleasant 
interview chewing out the head 
chef; he had suggested that the chef 
himself, old and tough as he cer-
tainly would be, nevertheless would 
make a better roast than the piece 
of meat tlhe ohef had been careless 
enough to send in to Their Charity 
the evening before. One of the duties 
that Memtok assumed personally was 
always to sample what his lord ate, 
despite the risk of poison and de-
spite the fact that Their Charity's 
tastes in cuisine were not his own. 
It was merely one of the innum-
erable ways in which Memtok gave 
ever painstaking attention to de-
tails, an imaginative diligence that 
had brought him, still in his prime, 
to his present supreme eminence. 
The head chef had grumbled and 
Memtok · had sent him away with 
just a taste of the lesser whip to re-
mind him that cooks were not all 
that hard to find. Then he had 
turned happily to his paperwork. 
There were stacks of it, as he had 
just completed moving the house-
hold from the Palace to the Sum-
so 

mer Palace -
thirty-eight of the 
Chosen but only four hundred and 
sixty-three 
servants; 
the summer 
residence was run with a skeleton 
staff. The twice-yearly move always 
involved a wash of paperwork -
purchase orders, musters, inventor-
ies, vouchers, shipping lists, revis-
ions of duty rosters, dispatches-
and he considered as usual advising 
his patron to have some likely young-
ster muted and trained as his clerk. 
But he rejected the idea, also as 
usual; Memtok did not trust servants 
who could read and write and add, 
it gave them ideas even if they 
could not talk. 
The truth was, Memtok loved his 

paperwork and did not want to 
share it. His hands flew quickly over 
the papers, checking figures, signing 
his symbol, okaying payments. He 
held his pen in an odd fashion, 
nested between the first three fingers 
of' his right hand -
this because he 
had no thumbs. 
He did not miss them, could bare-

ly remember what it had been like 
to have them. Nor did he need 
them. He could handle a spoon, a 
pen, and a whip without them, and 
he had no need ever to handle any-
thing else. 
Far from missing his thumbs, he 
was proud of their absence; they 
proved that he had served his loro 
in both major capacities, at stud 
when he was younger and now these 
many years as a tempered domestic. 
Every male servant over fourteen 
(with some scarce special excep-
tions) showed one alteration or the 
other; very few could exhibit both, 
only a few hundred on the entire 

IF 

Earth. Those few spoke as equals 
only to each other, they were an 
elite. 
Someone scratched at the door. 

"Come!" he called out, then, when 
he saw who it was, growled, "What 
do you want?" The growl was auto-
matic but he really did dislike this 
servant for the best of reasons; he 
was not subject to Memtok's dis--
cipline. He was of a different caste, 
huntsmen, wardens, 
keepers, and 
beaters, and was subject to the 
Majordomo of the Preserve. The 
Majordomo considered himself to be 
of the same rank as the Chief Dom-
estic, and nominally was. However, 
he had thumbs. 
Memtok's greatest objections to 
the Summer Palace was that it often 
put him in contact with these serv-
ants who had the unpardonable 
fault of not being under his orders. 
While it would take only a word to 
Their Charity to crack down on one 
of them, he disliked to ask, and 
while he could touch one of them 
up a little without any real fear of 
reprimand, the louse would be sure · 
to complain to his own boss. Mem-
tok did not believe in friction be-
tween executive servants. Bad for 
morale. 

"Message from Boss. Rayed to 

teU you Their Charity on his way 
back. Says four savages with the 
escort. Says you better tear up to the 
roof, take care of them. All." 

"'All'? Damn you, what do you 
mean 'All'? Why four savages? And 
in the Name of Uncle when are they 
arriving?" 

"All," the servant insisted. "Mes-

sage came in about twenty minutes 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

ago. I been looking all over for 
you." 

"Get out!" Memtok was jarred 

out of his warm euphoria of fussing 
with bits of paper. The important 
part of the message was that Their 
Charity was arriving home instead 
of staying away over night. Chef, 
Receptionist, 
Musical 
Director, 
Housekeeper, 
Groundskeeper, 
all 
heads 
of departments- he 
was 
phoning orders even as he thought. 
Four savages? Who cared about four 

savage..<~? 

But he was on the roof and ac-
cepted their custody. He would have 
been there anyway, with the Lord 
Protector arriving. 
W hen they arrived Hugh had no 
chance to see Barbara, re-
assure her, tell her to keep her chin 
up. When at last he was released 
from the gentle restraint of the 
"seat belt," he was Confronted by a 
little bald-headed white man with a 
waspish face, an abrupt manner, and 
a whip. He was dressed in a white 
robe which reminded Hugh of the 
night shirts his grandfather had 
worn, save that it had on the right 
shoulder the red and gold patch 
which Hugh had tentatively identi-
fied as the insigne of the big man, 
the boss. The emblem was repeated 
in rubies and gold on the chest of 
the little man as a medallion sup-
ported by a heavy gold chain. 
The man in the nightshirt looked 
him over with obvious distaste, then 
turned him and Duke over to an-
other white man in a nightshirt. 
This man wore no medallion but 
did carry a small whip. Hugh rubbed 

his. hand and resolved not to test 
whether this whip was as potent as 
the ornate one carried by the big 
boss. 
Duke tested it. The angry little 
man gave instructions to his straw 
boss, and left. The straw boss gave 
them an order; Hugh correctly in-
terpreted the tone and gesture as: 
"All right, you guys, get going. This 
way" -
and got going. 
Duke didn't. The straw boss bare-

ly touched him on his left calf; 
Duke yelped before he could stop 
himself. He limped the rest of the 
way -
down a ramp, into what 
turned out to be a very fast lift, then 
into a windowless, light, white-walled 
room which whiffed vaguely of hos-
pitals. 
Duke understood the order to 
strip down without needing to be 
stimulated; he cursed but complied. 
Hugh merely complied. He was be-
ginning to understand the system. 
The whips were used as spurs are 
used by a good rider, to exact 
prompt obedience but not with in-
tent to damage. 
From there they were herded in-

to a smaller room where they were 
hit from all sides by streams of 
water. The operator was in a gallery 
above. He shouted at them, then in-
dicated in pantomine that they were 
to scrub. 

They scrubbed. The water jets cut 
off, they were doused in a sirup that 
was liquid soap or detergent. They 
scrubbed again and were rinsed and 
were required to scrub still again, · 
all to gestures that left no doubt as 
to how thorough a bath was expect-
ed. The water jets got very hot and 

harsh, changed to cold and still 
harsher, were replaced by vioknt 
blasts of hot air. 
It was all too much like an auto-

matic dishwasher, Hugh felt, but 
they ended up cleaner than they had 
been in months. An assistant to the 
bathmaster then plastered strips over 
each of their eyebrows, rubbed an 
emulsion on their scalps, into their 
scratchy beards (neither had shaved 
that day), over their backs and 
chests and arms and legs, and finally 
into their pubic hair. Duke got an-
other lesson in obedience before he 
submitted to this 
last indignity. 
When, immediately thereafter, they 
were subjected willy-nilly to enemas, 
he gritted his teeth and took it. The 
water closet was a whirlpool set in 
the floor. Tb.eir finger and toe nails 
were cut short. 
After that they were bathed again. 
The eyebrow patches washed away. 
So did their hair. When they came 
out this time, they were both bald 
all over, save for eyebrows. 
The bathmaster made them gargle, 
showing them what he wanted and 
spitting into the whirlpool. They 
gargled three times- a rather pleas-
ant, pungent liquid- and when it 
was over Hugh found that his teeth 
seemed cleaner than they had ever 
been in his life. In fact he felt ut-
terly clean, lively, glowing with 
wellbeing- but humiliated. 
They were taken to another room 
and examined. 
T heir examiner was clearly a phy-

sician. He wore the conven-

tional white night shirt and a small 
insigne on a thin gold chain but he 

IF 

needed no diplomas on the wall 
to show his profession. His bedside 
manner would never make him rich, 
Hugh decided; he had the air of 
many military surgeons Hugh had 
known -
not unkind but quite im-

personal. 
He seemed much surprised by and 
very interested in a removable bridge 
he found in Hugh's mouth. He ex-
amined it closely, looked in Hugh's 
mouth at the gaps it had filled, gave 
it to one of his assistants with some 
instructions. The assistant went away 
and Hugh wondered if his chewing 
was going to be permanently ham-
pered. 
The physician took a leisurely 
hour or more over each of them, 
using instruments Hugh did not rec-
ognize and whose functions he could 
not, in most cases, guess. Weight, 
height, and blood pressure were al-
most the only familiar items. Things 
were done to them, too, none of 
them really unpleasant -
no hypo-
dermic needles, no knives. During 
this, Hugh's bridge was returned and 
he was allowed to put it back in. 
But the tests andjor treatments 
often seemed to be indignities even 
though not painful. Once, when 
Hugh was stretched out on a table 
from which Duke had just been re-
leased, the younger man said, "How 
do you like it, Dad?" 

"Restful." 
Duke snorted. 
The fact that both men had ap-

pendicitis scars seemed to interest 
the physician as much as the re-
movable bridge. By acting he indi-
cated a severe bellyache, then jabbed 
a thumb vigorously into McBurney's 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

point. Hugh conveyed ag·"f.~Cm'2nt -
with some difficulty, as nodding the 
head seemed to mean a negative re-
sponse. 
An assistant came in and handed 
the physician a contrivance which 
turned out to be another dental 
bridge, for Hugh was required to 
open his mouth; the old one . was 
again taken out and the new one 
carefully seated. It felt to Hugh's 
tongue as if he again had natural 
teeth there. The physician then 
probed a couple of cavities, cleaned 
them out and filled them -without 
pain but without anesthesia so far as 
Hugh was aware. 
After that Hugh was rather sud-
denly "strapped" (an invisible field 
again) to a table, supine, and his legs 
were elevated. Another table was 
wheeled up and Hugh suddenly real-
ized that he was being prepared for 
surgery- and with horror he was 
sure just what sort of surgery. 
"Duke! Don't let them grab you! 
Fight! Get that whip!" 

Duke hesitated an instant too long. 
The therapist did not carry a whip; 
he merely kept one at hand. Duke 
lunged for it, the physician got it 
first. Moments later Duke was on his 
back, still gasping his agony at pun-
ishment he had taken in trying to 
stop it and having his knees elevated 
and spread. They both went on pro-

te..~ting. 

The physician looked at them 
thoughtfully and the straw boss who 
had fetched them was called in. They 
conferred. Presently the 
waspish 
little man with the big medallion 
strode in, looked the situation over, 
stormed out. 

T here was a long wait. The boss 
therapist filled in the time by 
having his assistants complete prep-
arations for the surgery and there 
was no longer the slightest doubt in 
Hugh's mind, or Duke's, as to just 
what they were in for. In fact Duke 
pointed out that it would have been 
far better if they had fought- and 
died- earlier in the day, rather 
than wind up like this. As they 
would have fought, he reminded his 
father, if Hugh hadn't turned out to 
be chicken. 
Hugh didn't argue, he agreed. He 
tried to tell himself that his docility 
in being captured was on account of 
the women. But it afforded him little 
comfort. 
After a long time the little man 
with the medallion stormed back in, 
apparently angrier than ever. He 
snapped one curt order; Hugh and 
Duke were released. 
That ·ended it, save that they were 
each rubbed all over with a fragrant 
cream. They were given a white 
nightshirt apiece, conducted some 
distance through long bare passages 
and Hugh was shoved into a cell. 
The door was not locked but he 
could not open it. 
In one corner was a tray, with 
covered dishes and a spoon. The 
food was excellent and some of it 
utterly unidentifiable; Hugh ate with 
good appetite, scraping the dishes 
and drinking all of the thin beer 
with it. Then he slept for a while 
on a soft part of the floor, having 
blanked his mind of useless worry. 
He was awakened by being prod-

ded with a foot. 
He was taken to still another 

.... 

plain, windowless room, which turn-
ed out to be a school room. Two of 
the short white men in nightshirts 
were there. They were equipped 
with many props, the equivalent of 
a blackboard (it could be cleared 
instantly by some magic), infinite 
patience- and a whip, for the les-
sons were "taught to the tune of a 
hickory stick." No error went un· 
noted. 
They both could draw well and 
both were skilled and imaginative 
pantominists; Hugh was taught to 
speak. 
He was taught with extraordinary 
speed. Hugh discovered that his 
memory was greatly sharpened by 
the stimuli of pain; he had little 
tendency to repeat a mistake. At 
first he was punished only for for-
getting vocabulary, but as he learn-
ed, he also grew to expect flicks of 
pain for errors in inflection, con-
struction, idiom, and accent. 
This Pavlovian treatment con-

tinued -if his mental records were 
correct- for seventeen days; he did 
nothing else and saw ·no one but his 
teachers. They worked in shifts. 
Hugh worked every possible minute, 
about sixteen hours a day, 
he 
thought; at least he was never al-
lowed quite enough sleep although 
he never felt sleepy- he didn't dare 
-
during lessons. Once a day h.e 

was bathed and given a clean night-
shirt, twice a day he was fed, tasty 
food and plentiful, three times a day 
he was policed to the toilet. All oth-
er minutes were spent learning to 
speak, with ever the sharp aware-
ness that any bobble would be in-
stantly punished . 

IF 

But he learned how to duck pun-

ishment -
sometimes. A question, 
quickly put, would sometimes do. 
"Teacher, this one understands that 
there are protocol modes for each 
status, rising and falling, but what 
this one in its ignorance Jacks is 
knowledge of what each status is -
being wholly without experience 
through the inscrutable ways of 
Uncle the Mighty -
and also is 
sometimes not aware of the status 
assumed for teaching purposes by 
my charitable teacher and of the 
status this humble one is expected 
to assume in reply. More than that, 
this one does not know its own sta-
tus in the great family. May it please 
its teacher." 
T he whip was put down and for 
the next half hour he was lec--

tured. The problem was more in-
volved than Hugh's question show-
ed. The lowest possible status was 
stud. No, there was one lower: ser-
vant children. But children were ex-
pected to make mistakes, it did not 
matter; truly they had no status. 
Next higher was slut, then tempered 
servant- a category with subtle 
and effectively unlimited gradations 
of rank inside it, so involved that 
speech of equals was often used if 
the gradient was not clearly evident. 
High above all servants were the 

Chosen, with their own unlimited 
and sometimes changing variations 
of rank, including those ritual cir-
cumstances in which a lady takes 
precedence over a lord. But that was 
not usually any worry of a servant; 
always use protocol rising mode. 
However-

FARN·HAM'S FREEHOLD 

"If two of the Chosen speak to 
you at once, which one do you an-
swer?" 

"The junior," Hugh answered. 
"Why?" 
"Since the Chosen do not make 
mistakes, this one's ears were at 
fault. The senior did not actually 
speak, for his junior would never 
have interrupted." 

"Correct. You are a· tempered 
gardener and you encounter a Cho-
sen of the same rank as your lord 
uncle. He speaks. 'Boy, what sort of 
a flower is that?' " 

"As Their Charity knows much 
better than this one can ever know, 
if this one's eyes are not mistaken, 
that plant may be a hydrangea." 

"Good enough. But drop your 
eyes when you say it. Not to me. 
To the Chosen. Now about your 
status -" The teacher look:ed pain-
ed. "You haven't any." 

"Please, teacher?" 
"Uncle! I've tried to find out. No-

body knows but our Lord Uncle and 
they have not ruled. You're not a 
child, you're not a stud, you're no~ 
a tempered, you don't belong any-
where. Uncle alone knows. You're 
a savage and you don't fit." 

"But what protocol mode must I 

use?" 

"Always the rising. Oh, not to 
children. Nor to sluts, I venture. No 
need to overdo it." 

Except for the changes in inflec-

tion by status, Hugh found the lan-
guage simple and remarkably logi-
cal. lt had no irregular verbs and its 
syntax was orderly; it probably had 
been tidied up at some time by edict. 
He suspected, from a few words that 

he recognized- "simba," "bwana," 
"wazir," "etage," "trek," "oncle"-
that it had its roots in several Afri-
can languages. But that did not mat-
ter. This was "Speech" and, accord-
ing to his teachers, the only langu-
age spoken anywhere. 
In addition to protocol modes, 
quite a chunk of the vocabulary was 
double, one form of a word being 
used down, its exact synonym al-
though often utterly different in root 
used up. He had to know both-
be able to recognize one and to use 
the other. 
The pronunciation gave him trou-

ble at· first, but by the end of the 
first week he could lip-smack, click, 
make the fut glottal stop, and hear 
and say vowel distinctions he had 
never suspected existed. 
By the 
sixteenth day he was chattering free-
ly, beginning to think in it, and the 
whip was rarely used. 
· 

Late the next day the Lord Pro-

tector sent for him. 

XII 
Although he had already been 
bathed that day, Hugh was 
rushed through another violent bath 
in five minutes, rubbed down with 
fragrant cream, and issued a fresh 
white robe, before being whizzed to 
the lord'li private apartments. There 
he was bounced past a series of re-
ceptionists close on Memtok's heels, 
and into a large, private, and very 
sumptuous retiring room. 
The lord was not there; Joseph 
and Dr.-Livingstone-1-Presume were. 
Joe called out, "Hugh! Wonderful! 
You may go Memtok." 

Memtok hesitated, then backed 
away and left. Joe ignored him, slip-
ped his arm in Hugh's, and led him 
to a divan. "Gosh, it's good to see 
you! Sit down, we'll talk until Ponse 
gets here. You look well." Doctor 
Livingstone came 
up, 
checked 
Hugh's ankles, purred and stropped 
agaiust them. 

"I am well. 'Ponse'?" Hugh reach-

ed down and scratched the eat's 
ears. 

"Don't you know his name? The 
Lord Protector, I mean. No, I guess 
you wouldn't. That's one of his 
names, the one he uses en famille. 
He has a string of them, of course. 
Never mind, have they been treat-
ing you all right?" 

"Yes. I suppose so." 
"They had better. Ponse gave or-

ders for you to be pampered. Look, 
if you aren't treated okay, you tell 
me. I can fix it." 

Hugh hesitated. "Joe, have you 
had one of those odd whips used 
on you?" 

"Me?'' Joe seemed astonished. 

"No, of course no." He looked 
troubled. "Hugh, have they been 
abusing you? Peel off that mother 
hubbard and let me have a look." 

Hugh shook his head. "There are 
no marks on me. I haven't been 
hurt. But I certainly don't like it." 

"But if you've been stroked for 
no reason- Hugh, that's one thing 
that Ponse does not tolerate, I know. 
He's a very humane sort of guy. All 
he wants is discipline. If anybody-
anybody at all, even Memtok -has 
been cruel to you, well, somebody 
is going to catch it." 

Hugh thought about it. In actual 

IF 

FARNHAM' S FREEHOLD 
87 

truth he rather liked his teachers. 
They had worked hard and patiently 
over him and had been quite sparing 
of him once it became possible to 
talk instead of using the whip. "I 
haven't been hurt. Just reminded." 

"I'm glad to hear it. Actually, 
Hugh, I didn't see how you could 
be. That quirt Ponse carries -
well, 
you could ki1l a man with it at a 
thousand feet. I takes real skill to 
use it gently. But those toys the up-
per servants carry, all they do is 
tingle and that's aU they are sup-
posed to do." 
Hugh decided not to argue over 
what constituted a tingle; he had 
more urgent things on his mind. 
"Joe, how are the others? Have you 
seen- them?" 

"Oh, they're all right. Certainly. 

You heard about Barbara?" 

"I haven't heard a damn thing! 
What about Barbara?" 

"Slow down. Having her babies, 
I mean." 

"She had her baby?" 
"'Babies,' I said. Twin boys, iden-

tical. A week ago." 

"How is she? How is she?" 
"Easy, 
man! 
She's just fine, 
couldn't be better. Of course. They 
are way ahead of where we were in 
medicine; losing a mother, or a 
baby, is unheard of." Joe suddenly 
looked sad. "It's a cfuty shame they 
didn't run across us at least three 
months back." He brightened, "Bar-
bara told me that she had intended 
to name it Karen, if it was a girl. 
When it turned out to be twin boys, 
she named one- the one five min-
utes the elder- 'Hugh' and named 
the other 'Karl Joseph.' Nice, eh?" 

"I'm flattered. Then you've seen 
her. Joe, I've got to see her. Right 
away. How do I arrange it?" 
Joe looked astonished. "But you 
can't see her, Hugh. Surely you 
know that." 

"Why, in God's name, can't I?" 
"Why, you're not tempered, that's 
why. Impossible." 

"Oh." 
"I'm sorry, but that's the way it 

is." Joseph suddenly grinned. "But 
I understand that you· were almost 
made eligible by accident. Ponse 
laughed his head off at how close 
you came and how you and Duke 
yelped." 
· 

"I don't see the humor of it, I'm 

afraid." 

"Oh, shucks, Hugh, he simply has 
a robust sense of humor. He laughed 
when he told me about it. I didn't 
laugh and he decided that I have 
no sense of humor. Different people 
laugh at different things. Karen used 
to use a fake Negro dialect that set 
my teeth on edge, the times I hap-
pened to overhear it. But she didn't 
mean any harm by it. Karen- Well, 
they just don't come any better, and 
you and I both know it and I'll shut 
up about it. Look, if the vet had 
gone ahead on you, without orders, 
it would have cost him his hands; 
Ponse sent that word to him. Might 
have suspended the sentence, of 
course, to save his usefulness-
good surgeons are valuable. But his 
assumption was only natural, Hugh. 
Both you and Duke are too tall and 
too big for stud. However, Ponse 
doesn't tolerate sloppiness." 

"All right, all right. I still don't 

IF 

see the harm in my calling on Bar-
bara and seeing her babies. You saw 
her. And you're not tempered." 
Joe looked patiently exasperated. 
"Hugh, it'~ not the same thing. Sure-
ly you know it." 

"Why isn't it?" 
Joe sighed. "Hugh, I didn't make 
the rules. But I'm Chosen and you're 
not, and that's all there is to it. It's 
not my fault that you're white, now, 
• it?" 

"No. All right. Forget it." 
"Let's just be glad that one of us 
is in a position to get us all some 
favors. Do you realize that all of 
you would have been executed at 
o11ce? If I hadn't been along?" 

"The thought has crossed my 
mind. Lucky indeed that you knew 
French. And that he knows some 
French." 

Joe shook his head. "French didn't 

enter into it, it merely saved time. 
The point was that I was there ... 
and the rest of you were excused 
of any responsibility on that account. 
What had to be settled then was the 
degree of my criminality. My neck 
was very much in a noose." Joe 
frowned. "I'm still not in the clear. 
I mean, Ponse is convinced he's ac-
quitted me. But my case sti11 has 
to be reviewed by the Supreme Lord 
Proprietor. It's his preserve- Ponse 
is just custodian. I could be executed 
for it yet." 
"Joe what in the world is there 
about it to cause you to talk 
about being executed?" 

"Plenty! Look, if you four ofays 
had been there alone, Ponse would 
have tried you and excuted you just 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

by looking at you. Two capital 
crimes and both self-evident. Es-
capees. Servants who had run away 
from their lord. Destructive tres-
pass in a personal domain of the 
Supreme Proprietor. Open-and-shut 
on both counts and death for each 
of them. Now don't te11 me that 
wasn't the way it was because I ai-
ready know it and it took ~e long 
enough to make Ponse see it, using 
a language neither one of us knows 
too well. And my own neck is still 
in jeopardy. However-" He bright-
ened up -
"Ponse te11s me that the 

Supreme Proprietor is ten years be-
hind in reviewing criminal cases and 
t!hat it has been more years than 
that since he last set foot on this 
preserve or even cruised over it ... 
and that long before my case can 
possibly come up there won't be a 
trace of any destruction. They are 
already putting the trees back and 
there's never an accurate count of 
bears and deer and other game. He 
tells me not to worry." 

"Well, that's good." 
"But maybe you think I haven't 
done some sweating over it! Just 
letting your shadow fall across the 
Supreme Lord Proprietor means 
your neck. Sneezing in his presence 
is even worse -
so you can figure 
out for yourself that trespassing on 
land that is his personally is nothing 
to take lightly. But I shan't worry 
as long as Ponse says not to. He's 
been treating me as a guest, not as 
a prisoner. But tell me about your-
self. I hear you've been studying the 
language. So have I- a tutor every 
day I've had time for it." 

Hugh answered, "May it meet 

with their approval, this one's time 
has, as they know, been devoted to 
nothing else." 

"Whoo! You speak it better than 
I do." 

"I was given incentive," Hugh 
said, relapsing into English. "Joe. 
have you seen Duke? Grace?" 

"Duke, no. I haven't tried to. Fact 
is, Ponse has been away most of the 
time and took me along; I've been 
terribly busy. Grace, yes. It's even 
possible that you might see Grace. 
She's often in these apartments. 
That's the oaly way you could see 
her, of course. Right here. And in 
the presence of Ponse. Might hap-
pen. He's not a stickler for protocol 
when it suits his convenience to 
break it. In private, I mean. He 
keeps up appearaaces in public. His 
position requires it." 

"Hmm- Joe, 
in 
that 
case, 
couldn't you ask him to let me see 
Barbara and the twins? Here? In his 
presence?" 
Joe looked exasperated. "Hugh, 

can't you understand that I'm just 
a guest? I'm here on sufferance. I 
don't have a single ..servant of my 
own, no money, no title. I said you 
might see Grace here; I did not say 
you would. If you did, it would be 
because he had sent for you and it 
suited him not to send her out-
not for your convenience. As for 
asking him to let you see Barbara, 
I simply can't. And that's that! I ad-
vise· you not to, either. You might 
learn that his quirt doesn't just tin· 
gle." 

"All I meant was-" 
"Watch it, Hugbl Hero he comes, 

we'd better rise." 

Joe stood up and went to meet his 
host. Hugh stood with head 
bowed, eyes downcast, and waited 
to be noticed. Ponse came striding 
in, dressed much as Hugh had seen 
him before save that the helmet was 
replaced by a little red skullcap. He 
greeted Joe, sat heavily down on a 
large divan, stuck out his legs. Doc· 
tor Livingstone jumped up into the 
lord's lap; he stroked it. Two female 
servants appeared from nowhere, 
pulled off his boots, wiped his feet 
with a hot towel, dried them, mas-
saged them, placed slippers on them, 
and vanished. 
While this was going on, the Lord 
Protector spoke to Joe of matters 
Hugh had never heard of and could 
not follow other than as words, but 
he noticed with interest that the 
noble used the mode of equals to Joe 
and that Joe talked the same fash-
ion to him. Hugh decided that Joe 
must be in as solid as Doctor Liv· 
ingstone. Well, Joe did have a very 
pleasing personality. 
At last the big man glanced at 
him. "Sit down, boy." 

Hugh sat down, on the floor. The 
lord went on, "Have you learned 
Language? We're told that you have." 

"May it please Their Charity, this 
one's time has been devoted singly 
to that purpose, with what inade-
quate results known to them far bet-
ter than their servant would dare 
venture to estimate." 

"Not bad, not bad. Accent could 
be crisper. And you missed an infix 
on one word. How do you like the 
weather we've been having lately?" 

"Weather is as Uncle the Mighty 
ordains it. If it pleases His favorite 

Ill' 

nephew, it cannot fail to make joy-
ful one so bumble as this servant." 

"Quite good. Accent still blurry 
but understandable. Work on it. 
Tell your teachers we said it. Now 
drop that fancy speech, I haven't 
time to listen to it when I want a 
straight answer. Equals speech, al-
ways. In private, I mean." 

"All right. I -" Hugh broke off 

IUddenly; one of the female servanta 
had returned, to kneel in front of her 
bd with a cold drink on an ornate 
tray. 
Ponse glanced sharply at Hugh, 

then looked at the girl. "It? Doesn't 
count, it's a deaf mute. You were 
saying?" 

"Nothing much. I was about to 
say that I couldn't have an opinion 
about the weather because I haven't 
seen it at all since I got here." 

"I suppose not. I gave orders for 
you to learn Language as quickiy 
as possible and servants are inclined 
to follow instructions literally. No 
imagination. All right, you are to 
walk outdoors an hour each day 
from now on. Tell whoever is in 
cilarge of you. Any petition? Are 
you getting enough to eat? Are you 
being treated well?" 

"The food is good. I'm used to 

eating three times a day but-" 

"You can eat four times a day if 

It's any comfort to you. Again, tell 
the one in charge of you. All right, 
now to other matters. Hugh -that's 
your name, isn't it?" 

"Yes, Their Charity." 
"Can't you hear? I said, 'Use 

equals mode.' My private name ia 
Ponse. Use it. Hugh, if I had not 
picked you people up myself, were 

PAINHAM'S FREEiKOLD 

I not myself a scholar, and had I 
not seen with my own eyes the arti-
facts in that curious structure, your 
house, I would not have believed it. 
As it is, I must. I'm not a super-
stitious man. Uncle works in mys-
terious ways, granted, but He doesn't 
use miracles ... and I would . not 
hesitate to repeat that in any temple 
oo Bart!b, unorthodox as. it sound~. 
But- How long does it come to, 
Joe?" 

"Two thousand one hundred and 
three years." 

"Call it two thousand. What's the 
matter, Hugh?" 

"Ub, nothing, nothing." 
"If you're going to throw up, 
please go outside to do it; I picked 
out these rugs myself. As I was say-
ing, you've given my scientists some-
thing to think about- and a good 
thing, too; they haven't turned out 
anything more important than a bet-
ter mouse trap in years. Lazy scoun-
drels. I've told them to come up 
with a sensible answer, no miracles. 
How five people- or six, I under-
stand- and a small building of 
some mass could hurdle twenty cen-
turies and never break an egg. Ex-
aggregation. Joe tells me it broke 
some bones and some other things. 
Speaking of bones, Joe tells me this 
won't please you -
and it didn't 
please him -
but for scientific reas-
ons, I ordered my scientists to dis-
turb some bones. Strontium samp-
ling, that sort of thing; I suppose 
you've never heard of it. Clear proof 
that the cadaver bad matured before 
the period of maximum radioactiv-
ity- Look, I warned you about 
these rugs. DoD't do it!" 

"

'Hugh gulped ("Karen! Karen! 

Oh, my darling!") 

"Better now? Perhaps I should 
tell you that a priest was present 
throughout, all proper propitiations 
were made -
exactly as if it had 
been one of the Chosen. Special con-
cession, my orders. And when the 
tests were completed every atom was 
returned and the grave closed with 
proper rites. 

"That's true, Hugh," Joseph said 
gravely. "I was there. And I put 
on fresh flowers. Flowers that will 
stay fresh, I'm told." 

"Certainly they will stay fresh," 

Ponse confirmed, ''until they wear 
out from sheer erosion. I don't know 
why you use flowers but if there 
are any other rites or sacrifices nec-
essary to atone for what may seem 
to you a desecration, just name it. 
I'm a broad-minded man; I'm aware 
that other times bave bad other cus-
toms." 

"No. No, best just let it be." 
"As you wish. It was done from 
scientific necessity. It seemed more 
reasonable than amputating one of 
your fingers though perhaps I might 
have asked you. Other tests also kept 
my scientists from wiggling out of 
the obvious. Foods preserved by 
primitive methods so ancient that I 
doubt if any modem food expert 
would know how to go about dupli-
cating same -and yet the foods 
were, I am told, edible. At least 
some servants were required to eat 
them. No harm resulted. A fascina-
ting radioactivity gradient between 
the upper and inner sides of the 
roof structure -
I gave them a hint 
on that one. Acting on information 
fJ 

received from Joe, I ordered them 
to look for evidence that this event 
took place at the very beginning of 
the East-West War that destroyed 
the Northern Hemisphere. 

"So they found it. And calculations 
led them to believe that the struc-
ture must have been very near to the 
origin of an atom-kernel explosion. 
Yet it was unhurt. That produced a 
theory so wild that I won't tire your 
ears with it; I've told them to go on 
working. 

"But the best thing, from my 
viewpoint, is the historical treasure 
you bring with you. I am a man of 
history, Hugh. History, properly in-
terpreted, tells everything. The trea-
sure, of course, are those books that 
came along with you. I am not ex-
aggerating when I say that they are 
my most precious possessions. There 
are only two other copies of the 
Encyclopedia Britannica in the world 
today -
and those other two are not 
this edition and are in such poor 
shape that they are curiosities rather 
than something a scholar can work 
with; they weren't cared for during 
the Turmoil Ages." 

Ponse leaned back and stretched 
and looked very happy. "But mine 
is in mint condition!" 
He added, "I'm not discounting 
the other books. Treasures, all of 
them. Especially one, the Adven-
tures of Odysseus, which is not 
known only by reputation. I take it 
that the pictures in that book date 
from the time of Odysseus, too?" 

"I'm afraid not. The artist was 
alive in my time." 

"Too bad. They're interesting, 
nevertheless. Primitive art, stronger 
IF 

than we have now. But perhaps I 
exaggerated when I said that the 
the books were my chiefest posses-
sion." 

"Yes?" 
"You are! There! Doesn't that 
please you?" 
H ugh barely hesitated. "Yes. If 

true." (If it's true that I am 
your chatteL you arrogant bastard, I 
prefer being a valuable one!) 

"Oh, quite true. And if you had 
been speaking in protocol mode, you 
wouldn't have been able to phrase a 
doubt. I never lie, Hugh; remember 
that. You and -
That other one, 

Joe?" 

"Duke." 
" 'Duke.' Although Joe speaks 
highly of your scholarship, not so 
highly of its. But let me explain 
what you mean to me. There are 
other scholars who read Ancient 
English quite readily. None at pres-
ent in my household, true. Since it 
is not a root language to any im-
portant degree, few study it. Never-
theless scholars of English could be 
found, be borrowed. But none such 
as yourself. You actually lived then; 
you can, I am sure, read English as 
readily as I read Language, you'll be 
able 
to 
translate 
knowledgeably, 
without these maddening four and 
five interpretations of a single pas-
sage that so disfigure most trans-
lations from ancient sources, all be-
-cause the scholar doesn't 
really 
know what the ancient author was 
talking about. Lack of cultural con-
text, I mean. And no doubt you will 
"be able to supply on demand foot-
notes and explanations for things ob-

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

scure to me and commonplace to 
you. 

"Right? Right! So you see what 
I want of you. Start· with the En-
cyclopedia Britannica. Get busy to-
day, translate it. Just scribble it. out 
quickly, sloppy but 
fa~t S V"~ 'ne 

else will pretty it up for my eyes. 
Understand? All right, go do it." .. 

Hugh opened his mouth, gulped, 
closed it, then started ov~r. "But, 
Ponse, I can't write Language." 

"What?" 
"I was taught to speak it; I haven't 
been taught to read and write it." 

Ponse blinked. "Memtok!" 
The Chief Palace Domestic ar-

rived with such speed that one might 
have suspected that he was just out-
side the door. And so indeed he had 
been -listening in on private con-
versations of his patron by means, 
Memtok was certain, were not known 
to the Lord Protector ... certain in-
asmuch as Memtok was sti!l breath-
ing. Such measures were risky but 
he found them indispensable to the 
efficient performance of his duties. 
At worst; it was safer than planting 
a slut in there who was not quite a 
deaf mute. 

"Memtok, I told you that it was 
to be taught to speak, read, and write 
Language." 

Hugh listened, with eyes downcast, 
while the Chief Domestic · tried to 
protest simultaneously that the order 
had never been given (it had not) 
but nevertheless had been carried 
out (obviously false), all without. 
contradicting 
the Lord Protector 
(impossible to reconcile, inconceiv-
able to attempt). 

"Garbage," Ponse remarked. "I 

don't know why I don't put you up 
for adoption. You would look good 
in a coal mine. That pale skin of 
yours would be much improved by 
some healthy coal dust." He twitch-
ed the quirt in his hand and Mem-
tok paled still more. "Very well, let 
it be corrected. It is to spend half of 
each day in learning to read and 
write, the other half in translating 
and in dictating same into a record-
er. I should have thought of that be-
fore; writing out a translation takes 
too long. Nevertheless I want it to 
be able to read and write; it will 
need it for all I have in mind." 

He turned to Hugh. "Anything 

else you can think of? That you 
need?" 

Hugh started to phrase a request 
in the involved indirection which 
presumed nothing, as required by 
protocol mode, rising. 
Ponse chopped him off. "Speak 

directly, Hugh. Memtok, close 
your ears. No ceremony needed in 
Memtok's presence, he is a member 
of my inner family, my nephew in 
spirit if not in the eyes of my senior 
sister. Spit it out." 

Hugh noticed that Memtok relax-

ed and looked as beatific as his 
vinegar features permitted. "Well, 
Ponse, I need more room to work. 
My cell is about the size of that 
divan. Smaller." 

"Describe your needs." 
"Well, I'd like a room with natur-

al light, one with windows, say a 
third the size of this one. Working 
tables, book shelves, writing mater-
ials, a comfortable chair -
yes, and 
access to a toilet without having to 

wait; it interferes with my thinking 
otherwise." 

"Don't you have that now?" 
"No. And I don't think it helps 
my thinking to be touched up with 
a whip. I'm quite used to working 
hard without such inducement." 

"Memtok, have you been whip-

ping it?" 

"No, my uncle. I swear." 
"You would swear if you were 
caught with cream on your lip. Who 
has been?" 

Hugh dared to interrupt. "I'm not 
complaining, Ponse. But those whips 
make me nervous, I'm not used to 
!}tern. And I never know who can 
give me orders. Anybody, apparent-
ly. I haven't been able to find out 
my status." 
' 

"Hmm -
Memtok, where do you 
have it in the Family?" 

The head servant barely conceded 
that he had not been able to solve 
that problem. 

"Let's solve it. We make it a de-

partment head. Mmm. Department 
of Ancient History. Title: Chief Re-
searcher. Senior head of department, 
just below you. 
Pass the word 
around. I'm doing this to make clear 
just how valuable this servant is to 
me ... and anyone who slows up its 
work, even indirectly, is likely to 
wind up in the stew. I suppose it 
will really be a one-servant depart-
ment but you can fill it out, make 
it look good, by transferring its 
teachers, and whoever looks out for 
its recorder and prepares the stuff 
for me, a cleaner or two, maybe an 
assistant to keep them straight and 
bossed- I don't want to take up its 
valuable time on routine. A messen-

IF 

ger. You know. I'm sure there must 
be dozens of idlers around this house, 
eating their silly heads off, 
who 
would look well in the Department 
of Ancient History. Now have fetch-
ed a lesser whip and a lesser badge. 
Move." 

In moments only Hugh was wear-

ing a medallion not much smaller 
than Memtok's. Ponse took the whip 
of office and removed something 
from it. "Hugh, I'm not giving you 
a charged whip, you don't know-
how to use it. If one of your loafers 
need spurring, Memtok will be glad 
to help; he's expert. Later, when you 
know how, we'll see. Now. Are you 
satisfied?" 

Hugh decided that it was not the 
time to ask to be allowed to see Bar-
bara. Not with Memtok present. But 
he was beginning to hope that he 
could ask soon. 
He and Memtok were dismissed 
together. 
Memtok's face 
showed 
nothing but he did not object when 
Hugh walked abreast of him. 

XIII 
M emtok was silent while he led 
Hugh back down to servants' 
country; he had much to think over. 
He was figuring out how to handle 
this startling development to his own 
advantage. 
This savage's status had troubled 
the Chief Domestic from arrival. 
The trouble was, he didn't fit- and 
in Memtok's world everything had 
to fit. Well, now the savage had an 
assigned status. Their Charity had 
spoken and that was that. But the 
situation was not improved; it was 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

worse. The newly assigned status was 
so ridiculous as to make the whole 
below-stairs structure (the whole 
world, that is) a mockery. 
But Memtok was shrewd and 
very practical. The bedrock of his 
philosophy could be summed up in: 
You can't fight City Hall. And. his 
basic strategy in applying that phi-
losophy was the pragmatjc wisdom 
expressed in: When you can't beat 
'em, you join 'em. 
How could this savage's prepos-

terous promotion be made to appear 
both necessary and proper -
and a 
credit to the Chief Palace Domes-
tic? 
Uncle! The savage wasn't even 
tempered. Nor would he be. At 
least not yet, he amended. Later, 
possibly- it would make every-
thing so much more tidy. Memtok 
had been amazed when Their Char-
ity had postponed 
the obvious, 
couldn't understand it. But there it 
was. Memtok hardly recalled i1is 
own tempering; his emotions and 
drives before that time were a thin 
memory- of someone else. There 
was certainly no reason for the sav 
age to have kicked up a fuss about 
it; tempering marked promotion in-
to real living. Memtok looked for-
ward to at least a half a century 
more of activity, power, gracious liv 
ing, satisfaction. What stud could 
possibly claim that? 
But there it was. How to make it 
look good? 
A Curiosity! That's what the sav-

age was, a Curiosity. All great lords 
possessed Curiosities; there had been 
times when visiting with his equals 
or near-equals in his own caste that 

he had been somewhat ashamed of 
the fact that his own lord took. no 
interest in owning Curiosities. There 
were not even Siamese twins nor a 
two-headed freak in the whole house-
hold, not even stuffed. Not even a 
flipper-armed dwarf as a clown. 
Their Charity was -let's admit it 
..::.._ too simple in his tastes for his 
high rank; sometimes Memtok was 
a little ashamed of him. Spending 
his time on scrolls and such when 
he should be upholding the pride of 
the house. 
That lord of Hind- What was 
his title? Prince something or other 
silly. Never mind, he had that big 
cage where studs and sluts lived 
and mated with great apes, talked 
the same jabber- it wasn't Lan-
guage-and you couldn't te11 which 
was which save that some were hairy 
and some were smooth. There was a 
Curiosity worthy of a great house-
hold! That lord's chief domestic had 
declared by the Uncle that there 
were live crossbreeds from the ex-
periment, hidden away where the 
priests 
couldn't 
object. 
Memtok 
doubted that but wasn't certain. It 
might be true, since it was a never-
mentioned fact that despite all of-
ficial 
denial crossbreeds between 
servants and Ohosen were possible 
-
and did happen, even though 
designated bedwarmers were always 
sterile. But these rare accidents were 
never a11owed to see the light of day. 
A Curiosity, that was the angle. 
An untempered who was neverthe-
less a servant executive. A Famous 
Scholar who had not even been able 
to speak Language when he was al-
most as old as Memtok. A man out 

of nowhere. From the stars, per-
haps. Everybody knew that theJW 
were men somewhere in the stars. 
Probably a miracle involved . . • 

and the temples were investigatilll 
and any year now this household · 
would be famous for its unique Cur-
iosity. Yes. A word here, a word 
there, a veiled hint-

"Hugh," Memtok said cordially. 

"May I call you 'Hugh'?'' 

"What? Why, certainly!" 
"And you must call me 'Mem-

tok.' Let's stroll a bat and pick out 
space for your departmental head-
quarters. You would like a sunny 
place, I understand? Perhaps rooms _ 
facing on the gardens? And do you 
want your personal quarters open-
ing off your headquarters? Or would 
you rather have them elsewhere so 
that you can get away from it all?" 
The latter, Memtok had already de-
cided. Roust out both the head gar-
deners and the studmaster and give 
the savage both their quarters -
that would make everyone under-
stand at once just how important 
this Curiosity was ... and get both 
of them sore at the savage, too, 
which was good. He'd soon realize 
who was his friend. Memtok,. name-
ly, and nobody else. Besides, the 
gardener had been getting a little 
uppity, implying that his work didn't 
really come under the Chief Domes-
tic. A touching up was what he 
needed. 
Hugh said, "Oh, I don't need 
anything fancy. Just a convenient 
place to work." 

"Come, come! We want you to 
have every facility. Not a word, not 

IF 

a word. I wish I could get away 
from it all sometimes. But I can't. 
Problems, problems, problems, every 
minute of the day; some people have 
to have all their thinking done for 
them. It will be a rea:l treat to have 
a man of the mind among us. We'll 
find you cozy personal quarters, 
plenty of room for you and your 
valet. 'But separate." Valet? Was 
there 
a 
tern pered 
young 
buck 
around, well housebroken and bid-
dable, who could be depended on to 
report everything 
and 
keep 
his 
mouth shut? Suppose he had his 
sister's eldest son tempered now, 
would the lad shape up in time to 
do the job? 
And would his sister see the wis-

dom in pushing matters and part 
with 
the 
boy 
now? 
Or 
would 

she squawk? He had great hopes 
for the boy, as she well knew. Mem-
tok was coldly aware that lie would 
have to go some day -
though not 
for many years -
and he was de-

termined that his heir should suc-
ceed to his high office. But it would 
take · planning and such planning 
could never start too soon. If his 
sister could be made to see it-
Memtok intentionally led Hugh 
through crowded passageways in-
stead of by the direct and private 
route from Memtok's office to the 
Lord's apartments; servants · scurried 
out of the way wherever they went 
-save one unfortunate who stum-
bled and got tingled for his awk-
wardness. 
-

"My!" said Hugh. "This is a big 
building." Smaller than Gimbel's, 
perhaps. Or perhaps not. 

"This? Wait till you see the Pal-

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

MEMTOK 

ace itself -though no doubt it is 
falling to rack and min at the mo-
ment. under my chief deputy. Hugh, 
we use only a quarter of the staff 
he;e. There is no formal ente~tain­
mg, just garden parties. And only 
a handful of guests. In the city the 
Chosen are always corning and go-
ing. Many is the time I am rooted 
out of bed in the middle ofthe night 
to open apartments for some lord 
and his ladies without a moment's 
warning. And there is where organ-
ization and planning count. To be 
able to open the door of a guest 
wing flat and know-know, mind 
you, know without even looking-
that the beds are freshly perfumed, 
refreshments hot and cold waiting, 
everything spotless, 
music 
softly 
playing." 

"That must take real staff work." 

"Staff work!" Memtok snorted. 

"I wish I could agree. What 
it does take is for me myself to in-
spect every room, every night, no 
matter how tired I am, before I go 
to bed. Then stay up long enough 
to see that mistakes are corrected, 
not depend on their lies; They're 
all liars, Hugh. Too much 'Happi-
ness.' But Their Charity is generous; 
he never cuts down on the ration.'' 

"Certainly I've found the food 
ample. And good.'' 

"I didn't say food, I said 'Happi-

ness.' I control the food, not Their 
Charity -
and I don't believe in 
starving them, not even as punish-
ment. A tingle is better. They un-
derstand that. One thing you must 
always remember, Hugh, is that 
most servants don't really have 

minds. They're as thoughtless as the 
Chosen -
not referring to Their 

Charity of course; I would never 
criticize my own patron. I mean 
Charity in general. You understand.'' 
He winked and gave Hugh a dig in 
the ribs. 

"I don't know much about the 

Chosen," Hugh admitted. "I've hard-
ly laid eyes on them and I've spoken 
only to Their Charity.'' 

"Well ... keep your eyes open, 
you'll see. But it takes more than a 
dark skin to make brai:g.s no mat-
ter what they teach in temple. Not 
that I expect you to quote those 
sentiments nor would I admit it if 
you did. But -who do you think 
runs this household?" 

"I don't think I've been here long 
enough to express opinions.'' 

"Very shrewd. You could go far 
if you had ambition. Let me put it 
this way. If Their Charity goes away, 
the household goes on smoothly as 
ever- or smoother. If I am away, 
or dare to fall sick -
well, I shud-

der to think of it.'' He gestured With 
his whip ahead of them. "They 
know. You won't find them scurry-
ing that fast to get out of his way.'' 
Hugh changed the subject. "I did 
not understand your remark about a 
'ration of Happiness.' " 

"Haven't 
you 
been 
receiving 

yours?" 

"I don't know what it is.'' 
"Oho! One bullock gets you three 
that it has been issued but never got 
as far as you. Must look into that. 
As to what it is, I'll show you.'' 
Memtok led him up a ramp, through 
a door and out onto a balcony. Be-
low was the servants' main dining 

IF 

hall, now crowded with three queues. 
"This is issue time -
studs at a dif-
ferent hour, of course. They can 
have it as drink, in chewing form, 
or to smoke. The dosage is the same 
but some say that smoking it pro-
duces the keenest happiness." 

Memtok used words not yet in 
Hugh's vocabulary. Hugh told him 
so. Memtok said, "Never mind. It 
improves the appetite, steadies the 
nerves, promotes good health, en-
hances all pleasures- and wrecks 
ambition. The trick is to be able to 
take it, or leave it alone. I never 
took it regularly even when I was at 
stud; I had ambition. I take it now 
only on feast days or such -
and 
only in moderation." Memtok smil-
ed. "You'll find out tonight." 

"I will?" 
"Didn't I tell you? Banquet in 

ybur honor, just after the hour of 
evening prayer." 

Hugh was hardly listening. He 

was, searching the far queue, trying 
to spot Barbara. 
M emtok sent the Chief Veterin-
arian and the Household En-

aineer as an escort of honor for 
Hugh. Hugh was mildly embarrassed 
at this attention from the physician 
and surgeon in view of the helpless 
posture he had been in the -last time 
be had seen the man. But the veter-
inarian seemed to see nothing odd, 
be was most cordial. 
Memtok headed the long table 

with Hugh on his right. Some twenty 
department heads were seated; there 
was at least one lower servant stand-
ing behind each guest and endless 
streams of them coming in and out

from kitchen and pantry. The ban-
quet room was beautiful, its fur-
nishings lavish, and the feast was 
sumptuous and endless; Hugh won-
dered what a meal of the Chosen 
must be like if their upper servants 
ate this way. 
He soon found out, in part. Mem-
tok was served twice, once from· the 
same tasty and numerous dishes 
everyone shared, again from another 
complete menu. These dishes he sam-
pled, using separate plates for them, 
but rarely did more than taste. Of 
the regular menu he ate sparingly 
and sometimes passed up dishes. 
He noticed Hugh's glance. "The 

Lord Protector's dinner. Try any of 
it you like. At your own risk, of 
course." 

"What risk?" 
"Poison, naturally. When a man 
is over a hundred years old his heir 
is certain to be impatient. To say 
nothing of business competitors, po-
litical rivals, and subverted friends. 
Go ahead; the taster tries it half an 
hour before Their Charity- or I 
-
touches it, and we've lost only 
one taster this year." 

Hugh decided that his nerve was 
being tested; he tried a spoonful 
from a dish Memtok had sampled. 

"Like it?" asked Memtok. 
"Seems a bit greasy to me." 
"Hear that, Gnou? Our new cous-
in is a man of taste. Greasy. And 
someday you'll be fried in your own 
grease, I fear. The truth is, Hugh, 
that we eat better than the Chosen 
do ... although courses are served 
more elaborately and beautifully in 
the Grand Hall, of course, of course. 
But I am a gourmet who appreciates 

"

artistry in food; Their Charity real-
ly doesn't care what it is as long as 
it doesn't squeal when he bites it. 
In fact, if the sauces are too elabor-
ate, the spices too exotic, he'll send 
it back with a demand for a plain 
slice of roast, a hunk of plain bread, 
and a pitcher of milk. True, Gnou?" 

"You have said it." 
"And frustrating." 
"Very," admitted the chef. 
"So Cousin Gnou's best cooks 
work for us. and the Chosen struggle 
along with ones whose chief skill lies 
in getting a bird's skin back on with-
out ruffling the feathers. And now, 
Cou,;in Hu·•h, if you will excuse me 
a moment, I must lift up to the 
Grand Hall and attempt by proper 
ceremony to make Cousin Gncn's 
piece de resistance seem better than 
it is. Hugh, don't believe what they 
tell you about me while I'm gone-
regrettably it's all true." He exposed 
his teeth in what must have been a 
smile and left. 

l't.. ·Jo one spoke for a while. Final-
1 ~ !y someone- Hugh thought it 
was the transportation master but 
he had met too many too fast -
said. "Chief Researcher, what house-
hold were you with before you were 
adopted here, may one ask?" 

"One may ask. House of Farn-

ham. Freeholder Extraordinary." 

"So. I am forced to admit that 
the title of your Chosen is new to 
me .. A new title, perhaps?" 

"Very old," Hugh answered. "Ex-

tremely ancient and granted directly 
by Uncle the Mighty, blessed be His 
Name. The rank is roughly that of 
king, but senior to it." 

"Really?" said the master. 
Hugh decided to drop that shovel 
and pick up a wider one. In his con~ 
versation earlier that day he had 
learned that Memtok knew a great 
deal about many things -but al-
most nothing about such trivia as 
history, geography, and other mat-
ters outside the household. And he 
had learned in his Language lessons 
that a servant who could read and 
write was rare, even among execu-
tive servants, unless the skill was 
necessary to his duties. Memtok had 
told him proudly that he had peti-
tioned the opportunity while he was 
still at stud and had labored at it 
to the vast amusement of the other 
studs. "But I had my eyes on the 
future," he had told Hugh. "I could 
have had at least five more years, 
probably ten, at stud. But as soon 
as I could read, I petitioned to be 
tempered. So I had the la~t laugh-
for where are they now?" 

Hugh decided that the very widest 
shovel was needed; a big lie was 
always easier to sell than a little 
one. "The title is unbroken for over 
three thousand years in House Farn-
ham. The line remained intact by 
direct intervention of the Uncle right 
th-rough the Turmoil and the Change. 
Because of its Divine ori~in its hold-
er always speaks to the Proprietor 
as an equal, 'thee' and 'thou.'" Hugh 
drew himself up proudly. "And 1 
was factotum-in-chief of Lord Farn-
ham. I did everything for him." 

"A noble house indeed. But 'fac-

totum-in-chief'? We don't use that 
designation here. Is it a domestic?" 

"Yes and no. The chief domestic 

W!Drks under the factotum." 

IF 

The man almost gasped. "And 

8()1 ~' Hugh went on, "do all servant 
eucutives, domestic or not -
busi-

ness, political, agrarian. everything. 
The responsibility is very wearing." 

"So I should imagine!" 
"It is. 1 was growing old and my 
health was failing- I suffered a 
temporary paralysis of my lower 
limbs. Truthfully I never liked so 
much responsibility, I am a scholar 
by nature. So I petitioned to be 
adopted and here I am -
scholar to 
a Chosen of similar scholarly tastes 
... a fitting occupation." 
Hugh then realized that he had 
stretched one item too far; the veter-
inarian had looked up with interest. 
"This paralysis. I noted no signs." 

(Damn it, doctors never cared 
anything about anything but their 
own specialty!) "It came on me sud-
denly one morning," Hugh said. 
smoothly, "and I haven't been trou-
bled by it since. But to a man of my 
years, a warning to be heeded." 

"And what are your years? Pro-

fessional interest, of course. One 
may ask?" 
H ugh tried to make the snub as 
direct as some he had heard 
Memtok pass out. "One may not. 
I'll let you know when I need your 
services. But," he added, to sooth 
the smart a little, "It would be fair 
to say that I was born some years 
earlier than was Their Charity." 

"Astonishing. From your physical 
condition -
quite good, I thought-
I would have judged you to be no 
more than sixty, at the most." 

"Blood will tell," Hugh said smug-

ly. "As you know best. I am not the 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

only one of my blood line to live a 
very long time." 

He was saved from further eva-

sions to cover his whoppers by the 
return of Memtok. Everyone stood 
up. Hugh didn't notice in time, so he 
remained seated and brazened it out. 
If Mcmtok resented it, he did not 
let it show. He clapped Hugh on the 
shoulder as he sat down.. "No doubt 
they've told you how I eat my own 
young?" 

"I was given the impression of a 
happy family presided over by a be-
loved uncle." 

"Liars, all of them. Well, I'm 
through 
for 
the evening- until 
some emergency comes up. Their 
Charity knows that we are welcoming 
you; he commanded me not to re-
turn to the Grand Hall. So now we 
can relax and be merry." The Chief 
Domestic tapped his goblet with a 
spoon. "Cousins and nephews, a 
toast to our newest cousin. Possibly 
you heard what 1 said -the Lord 
Protector is pleased at our modest 
effort to make Cousin Hugh feel at 
home in Their family. But I am sure 
that you already guessed that ... 
since one cannot miss that Cousin 
Hugh carries, not a least whip, but a 
lesser whip exactly like mine!" Mem-
tok smiled archly. "Let us all trust 
that he will never need to use it." 

Loud applause greeted the boss's 
brilliant sally. He went on solemnly, 

·~You all know that not even my 
chief deputy carries such authority, 
much less the ordinary department 
head ... and from that I am sure 
you will conclude that a hint from 
Cousin Hugh, Chief Researcher and 
Aide in Scholarship to Their Charity 

by direct apointment -
a hint from 
him is an order from me -so don't 
let me make it a direct order. 

"And now the first toast! All 
cousins together and let Happiness 
flow 
freely ... so 
let the 
junior 
among us give the first toast. Who 
claims it, who claims it?" 

The party got rowdy. Early, Hugh 
noted that Memtok drank very spar-
ingly. He remembered the warning 
and tried to emulate him. But it was 
impossible. 
The Chief Domestic 
could drop out of any toast, mere-
ly raise his glass, but Hugh as guest 
of honor felt compelled to drink 
them all. 
Some unknown time later Mem-

tok led him back to his new-

ly acquired and luxurious quarters. 
Hugh felt drunk but not unsteady 
-it was just that the floor was so 
far away. He felt illuminated, pos-
sessed of the wisdom of the ages, 
floating on silvery clouds, and soak-
ed through with angelic happiness. 
He still had no idea what was in 
Happiness drinks (he had drunk it 
only, not smoked or chewed it). Al-
cohol? Maybe. Betel nut? Mush-
rooms? 
Probably. 
Marijuana? It 
seemed certain. He must remember 
to write 'down the form~la while it 
was fresh in his mind. This was what 
Grace should have had! He must-
Bu.t of course, she did have it now. 
How very nice! Poor old Grace. He 
had never understood her -
all she 
needed was a little Happiness. 
Memtok took him into his bed-

room. Sleeping across the foot of 
his lovely new bed was a female 
creature, blonde and cuddly. 

Hugh looked down at her from 
about a hundred feet elevation and 
blinked. "Who she?" 

"Your bedwarmer. Didn't I say?" 
"But-" 
"It's quite all 
right. Yes, yes, I 
know you are technically a stud. 
But you can't harm her, I assure 
you; this is what, she is for. No 
danger. Not even altered. A nat-
ural freemartin, this one." 

Hugh turned around to discuss 
it, wheeling slowly because of his 
great width and high sail area. But 
Memtok was gone. Hugh found that 
he could just make it to the bed. 
"Move over, Kitten," he muttered, 
and fell asleep. 
He overslept but the kitten was 
still there; she had his breakfast 
waiting. He looked at her with un-
ease -
not because he had a hang-

over; he did not. Apparently Hap-
piness did not exact such payments 
-
and was thereby that much more 
insidious. He felt physically strona, 
mentally alert, and morally straight 
-and very hungry. But this teen-
ager was an embarrassment. 

"What's your name, kitten?" 
"May it please them, this one's 
name is of such little importance 
that whatever they please to caD 
it will be a boon." 

"Cut 
it, 
cut 
it! 
Use 
equals 

speech." 

"I don't really have a name, sir, 
not yet. Mostly they just say, 'Hey, 
you.'" 

"All right, I'll call you 'Kitten.' 
Does that suit you? You look like 
a kitten." 

She dimpled. "Yes. sir. It's ever 

10 much nicer than 'Hey, you.' " 

• All right, your name is 'Kitten' 
IF 

and tell everybody that it is and 
don't answer to 'Hey, you.' Tell them 
that is official because the Chief 
Researcher says so and if anybody 
doubts it, tell them to check with 
the Chief Domestic. If they · dare." 

"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Kitten, 
Kitten, Kitten," she repeated as if 
memorizing 
it, 
then 
giggled. 

"Pretty!" 

"Good. Is that my breakfast?'' 
"Yes, sir." 
He ate in bed, offering her bits, 
and discovered that she evidently 
el:pected to be fed, or at least al-
lowed to eat. There was enough for 
four; between them they ate enough 
for three. Then he learned that she 
expected to assist him in the bath-
room; he put a stop to that. 
L ater, ready to get hard at work 
at his assigned duties, he said 
to her, "What do you do now?" 

"I go back to sluts' quarters, sir, 
as soon as you release me. But I 
come back at bedtime -whatever 
time you say." 

He was about to tell her that 

once was a joke and that she was 
charming and that he almost re-
gretted passing out the night before 
but that he did not require her 
services on any future -
He stop-

ped, An idea had hit him. "Look. 
Do you know a tall slut named Bar-
bara? Oh, this much taller than you 
are, at least. She was adopted some-
thing over two weeks ago and she 
had babies, twin boys, about a week 
ago." 

"Oh, yes, sir. The savage." 
"That's the one. Do you know 
where she is? Can you go to her?" 

"Oh, yes, sir. She's still in lying-

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

in quarters. I like to go in there and 
look at the babie!i." She looked wist-
ful. "It must be nice." 

"Uh, yes. Can you take a mes-

sage to her?" 

Kitten looked doubtful. "I don't 
know. She might not understand. 
She's a savage, you know. She can't 
talk very well." 

"Mmm. Damn. No, maybe it's a 
help. Wait a moment." His quarters 
had been equipped with· a desk; he 
went to it, got one of those extra-
ordinary pens -they didn't stain 
and didn't wear out and appeared 
to be solid plastic, no ink -
found 
a piece of paper. Hastily he wrote a 
note, asking Barbara about herself 
and the twins, assuring her of his 
own welfare and his odd promotion, 
telling her that soon, somehow, he 
would see her -
be patient, dear 
-
and assuring her of his love. 
He added a P.S. "The bearer of 
this note is 'Kitten' -
if the bearer 
is short, blonde, busty, and about 
fourteen. She is my bedwarmer -
and that's all she is and you've got 
an evil mind, wench! I'm going to 
hang onto her because she is a way 
-the only way, it would appear-
for me to communicate with you. 
I'll try to write every day, I'll darn 
well expect a note from you every 
day. If you can. And if anybody 
does anything you don't like. tell 
me and I'll send you his head on a 
platter. I think. Things are looking 
up. Plenty of paper and a pen here-
with. Love, love, love- H. 

"PPS- go easy .on 'Happiness.' 
It's habit-forming." 
He gave the girl the note and writ-

ing materials. "You know the Chief 
Domestic by sight?" 

"Oh, yes, sir. I've warmed his 

bed. Twice." 

"Really? I'm amazed." 
"Why, sir?" 
"Well, I didn't think he would 
be interested." 

"You mean because he's tem-
pered? Oh, but several of the ex-
ecutives like to have a bedwarmer 
anyhmy. I like it better than being 
sent upstairs; it's less trouble and 
you get lots more sleep. The Chief 
Domestic doesn't usually send for a 
bedwarmer, though. It's just that he 
checks us and teaches us manners 
before we are allowed to serve up-
stairs." She added, "You see, he 
knows all about it; he used to be a 
stud, you know." She looked at 
Hugh with innocent curiosity that 
seemed capable of staring through 
his robe. "Is it true what they say 
about you? May you ask?" 

"Uh ... one may not." 
"I'm 
sorry, 
sir." 
She 
looked 
crushed. "I didn't mean any harm. 
But some of the sluts are such gos-
sips." She glanced fearfully at his 
whip, looked away and dropped her 
eyes. 

"Kitten." 
"Yes, sir." 
"See this whip?" 
"Uh, yessir!" 
"You will never, never, never feel 
my whip. That's a promise. Never. 
We're friends." 

Her face lit up and she looked 
angelically beautiful instead of mere-
ly pretty. "Oh, thank you, sir!" 

"And another thing. The only 
whip you need fear from now on is 
the Chief Domestic's. So stay out 
of his way. Anyone else- any 
'least whip' -you tell him. or her, 

that this lesser whip is what he'll 
get if he touches you. Tell him to 
check with the Chief Domestic if 
he doesn't think I mean it. Under-
stand me?" 

"Yes, sir." She looked smugly 
happy. 
Too smug, Hugh decided. "But 

you stay out of trouble. Don't do 
anything to deserve a tingle -or I 
might turn you over to the Chief 
Domestic for a real tingling, the sort 
he is famous for. But as long as you 
are working for me, don't allow 
anyone but him to tingle you . . • 
and I solemnly promise that my 
whip will never touch you. Now git 
and deliver that. I'll see you to-
night, say about two hours after 
evening prayer. Or come earlier if 
you are sleepy and go to bed." Must 
remember to have a little bed put 
in here for her, he reminded himself. 
K itten touched her forehead and 
left. Hugh went to his office 
and spent a happy day learning the 
alphabet and dictating three articles 
from the Britannica. He found his 
vocabulary utterly inadequate, so he 
sent for one of his teachers and used 
the man as a walking dictionary. 
Even so, he found it necessary to 
amplify and explain almost end-
lessly; concepts had changed. 
Kitten went straight to the Chief 
Domestic's office, made her report, 
turned the note and writing mater-
ials over to him. Memtok was more 
than a little annoyed that he held 
in his hand what might he important 
evidence -
and no way to read it. 

It did occur to him that that other 
one- Duke? Some such -
might 
possibly be able to read these hen 

Ill' 

scratches. But not likely, of course, 
and even under tingiing there would 
be no certainty that Duke would 
translate honestly, and no way· to 
check on him. 
Asking Joe, of course, 
never 
never crossed his mind. Nor did 
asking Their Charity's new bed-
warmer. But the impasse did have 
one intriguing aspect. Was it pos-
sible that this savage slut actually 
could read? And perhaps even essay 
to write a reply? 
He stuck the note in his copier, 
gave it back to the girl. "All right, 
your name is Kitten. And do exactly 
as he tells you about not letting 
yourself be tingled -
and be sure to 
gossip about it; I want it known all 
over. But get this -
" He gave Kit-
ten the gentlest of reminders on her 
left calf; she jumped. "This whip is 
waiting for you, if you make any 
mistakes." 

"This one hears and obeys!" 
Hugh returned to his flat from the 
executives dining room rather late; 
be had sat around and gossiped. 
He found Kitten asleep in his bed 
and remembered only then that he 
bad forgotten to ask for another 
bed for her. 

She had clutched in her hand a 
folded paper. Gently he worked it 
out with9ut waking her: 

Darling. 
How utterly wonderful to see your 
handwriting! 
Almost as good as 
touching your hand. (But not quite.) 
I knew from Joe that you were safe. 
hadu't heard about your promotion. 
didn't know for sure that you knew 
about the twins. First about them -
They are thriving. they both look like 
their papa, both have his angelic dis-
position. Six pounds each at birth Is 
my guess, but, although they were 
weighed. weights here mean nothing 
to me. Me? I'm a prize cow, dearest. 
No trouble at all -
and the care I 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

received (and am receiving) Is fan-
tastically good. I started to labor, 
was given something to drink, never 
hurt again at all although I remem-
ber all details of having two babies 
--as If it had happened to somebody 
else. So trouble free and actually 
pleasant that I'd be willing to do It 
every day and twice on Sundays. And 
would, If the rewards were as nice as 
Uttle Hugh and Karl Joseph. 
As for the rest since then, boring 
except for our fine boys, but I'm 
learning the language as fast as I 
oan. And somebody should tell the 
Borden company about me--which 
Is good, as our scamps are greedy 
eaters. I'm even able to help out the 
girl in the next bed who is rRther 
short on milk. Just call me Elsie. 
I'll be patient. I'm not the least 
surprised at your new honors; I ex-
pect you'll be bossing the place In a 
month. 
I have confidence In my 

man. My husband. Such a beautiful 
word-
As for Kitten, I don't believe a 
word of your Boy Scout assPrtions, 
my lecherous darling; your record 
shows that you take Instant advan-
tage of Innocent young girls. And 
she's awfully cute. 

Seriously, dearest, 
I 
know how 
noble you are about such things and 
I didn't have an evil-minded thought. 
But I would not blame you if your 
nobility slipped a little-especially 
as I've picked up enough words to 
be aware of her odd category in this 
strange place. I mean, Kitten is not 
vulnerable and can't go set. If you 
did slip, I would not be jealous-
not much, anyhow-but I would not 
want It to become a habit. Not to the 
exclusion of me, at least; my hor-
mones seem to be rearranging them-
selves very rapidly and I'm not that 
noble. But I don't want you to get 
rid of her when she Is our only way 
of cmrununlcatlng. Be nice to her; 
she's a nice kid. But you would any-
way, you're always nice to every-
one. 
I wlll write everyday. And I wlll 

cry In my pillow and be worried to 
death any day I don't herur from you. 
My love focever and forever, 
B. 

P.S. The smear on the bottom Is lit-
tle Hugh's right footprint. 

Hugh kissed the letter, then got 
quickly into bed, clutching it. Kit-
ten did not wake. 
Hugh slept soundly. 

XIV 
Hugh found learning to read and 

write Language not difficult. 
Spelling was phonetic, with a sign 
for every sound. There were no 
silent letters and never any ques-
tion about spelling or pronunciation. 
Accent was always on th~t penultima 
unless marked; the system was as 
free from traps as Esperanto. He 
found that he could sound out any 
word as soon as he had learned the 
47-Ietter alphabet, and that, with a 
little thought, he coqld spell any 
word he could pronounce. 
Writing and printing were alike, 
both cursive, and a printed page 
looked like one written by a skilled 
penman. He was not surprised to 
find that the writing-printing looked 
like Arabic and a search in the Brit-
annica confirmed that the alphabet 
must have derived 
(with many 
changes) from Arabic of his time. 
Half a dozen letters bad not changed; 
some others were similar although 
changed. But there were many new 
letters to cover the expansion into 
a system of one sound, one sign-
plus letters for sounds XXth cen-
tury Arabic had never used. Care-
ful search in the Britannica con-
vinced him that Arabic, French and 
Swahili were the main roots of 
Language, plus Uncle alone knew 
what else. But he could not confirm 
this. An unabridged dictionary ef 
language, one with derivations, such 
as he had been used to for English, 
apparently did not exist -
and his 
teachers seemed convinced that Lan-
guage had always been just as they 
knew it. The concept of change 
baffled them. 

No matter, it was only of intel-
lectual interest; Hugh knew neither 
Arabic, French nor Swahili. He had 
learned a little Latin and less Ger-
man in high school, and had strug-
gled to learn Russian in his later 
years when it appeared that, win 
or lose, Russian might be useful. He 
was not equipped to study the roots 
of language, he was merely curious. 
Nor did he dare spend much time 

on it. He wanted to please Their 
Charity. butter him up thoroughly 
so that he might, eventually, petition 
the boon of seeing Barbara- and 
that meant a flood of translated ar-
ticles. Hugh consistently worked 

ve~ry hard at it. 
The second day after his elev ... 

tion, Hugh asked for Duke and 
Memtok promptly sent for him. 
Duke was rather worn down -
there 
were lines in his 
face -
but he 

spoke Language. Duke spoke it not 
as well as his father did and ap-
parently had tangled with his teach-
en more than Hugh had; his mood 
seemed to oscillate between utter 
hopelessness and reckless rebellion, 
and he was limping badly on his 
left leg. 

· Memtok made no objection to 
transferring Duke to the Department 
of Ancient History. "Glad to get rid 
of him. He's too monstrous big for 
stud, yet he doesn't seem to be good 
for anything else. Certainly, put him 
to work. I can't bear to see a serv-
ant lying around, eating his head off, 
and doing nothing." 

So Hugh took him along. Duke 

looked over Hugh's private apart-
ment and said, "Christ! You certain-
ly managed to come up smelling like 
a rose. How come?" 

U' 

H ugh explained the situation. "So 

what I want you to do is to 
translate legal articles and related 
subjects -whatever you can do 
best. We don't have to start at 'A' 
and work through to 'Z'- alpha-
betical by our alphabet means noth-
ing. I'm going to work up a subject 
index instead. But that's not your 
worry. You'll just sit and dictate 
translations into a recorder cone." 

Duke shoved his fists together and 
looked stubborn. "You can stuff it." 

"Duke, don't take that attitude. 
This is an opportunity." 

"For you, maybe. What are you 
doing about Mother?" 

"Mat can I do? I'm not allowed 
to see her, neither are you. You 
know that. But Joe assures me that 
she is not only comfortable and weD 
treated, but happy." · 

"So he says. Or so you say he 
says. I want to see it myself. I damn 
well insist on it." 

"Very well, insist on it. Go see 
Memtok about it. But I must warn 
you, I can't protect you from him." 

"Rats. I know what that slimy 
little bastard would say -
and what 
he would be likely to do." Duke 
scowled and rubbed his injured leg. 
"It's up to you to arrange it. You've 
got such an unholy drag around 
here, the least you can do with it is 
to use it to protect Mother." 

"Duke, I don't have that sort of 
drag. I'm being pampered for the 
same reason a race horse is pam-
pered . . . and I have just as little 
control over it as a race horse has 
over when and how he will race. 
But I can cut you in on some pam-
pering if you cooperate. Decent 
quarters, immunity from mistreat-

FARNHAM'S FREBHOLD 

ment, a pleasant place to work-· 
easy work, really! But I can no more 
get you into women's quarters, or 
have Grace sent here, than I can go 
to the Moon. They have harem rules 
here, as you know." 

"And you are content to sit here 
and be a trained seal for that ape, 
and neglect Mother? Count me out!" 

"Duke, I won't argue. i'll assign 
you a room to work .in and send you 
a volume of the Britannica each day. 
Then it's up to you. If you won't 
work, I'll try to keep Memtok from 
knowing it. But I rather think he has 
spies all over the place." 

Hugh let it go at that. At first he 
got no help out of Duke. Hugh ig-
nored it and pretended that Duke 
was working. But in time boredom 
worked where argument had failed; 
Duke could not stand to be shut up 
in a featureless room with nothing 
to do. He was not locked up but he 
did not venture out much because 
there was always the chance that he 
might run into Memtok, or some 
other whip-carrying upper servant 
who might want to know where he 
was going, what he was doing, and 
why. Servants were expected to look 
busy even if they weren't from 
morning prayer to evening prayer. 
Duke began to produce transla-
tions and, with them, a complaint 
that he was short on vocabulary. 
Hugh made inquiries and was able 
to have assigned to him a tempered 
clerk who had worked as a stenog-
rapher in Their Charity's many legal 
affairs. 
But he rarely saw Duke. It seemed 
to be the only way they could stay 
out of arguments. Duke's output 
speeded up after the first week but 

IG7 

fell off in quality- Duke had dis-
covered the sovereign power of 
"Happiness." 
Hugh considered warning Duke 
about the drug, decided against it. 
If it kept Duke contented in captiv-
ity, who was he to deny him this 
anoJyne? The poor quality of Duke's 
translations, 
those 
Hugh 
had 
checked, did not worry Hugh; Their 
Chnrity had no way to judge-
unless Joe rendered an opinion, 
which seemed unlikely. He himself 

\"a~ not trying too hard to turn out 
good translation. "Not good, but 
Wednesday" was the principle he 
used: Give the boss lucid copy in 
great quantity- and leave out the 
hard parts. 
Besides, Hugh had found that a 
couple of drinks of "Happiness" at 
dinner topped the day off nicely. 
It allowed him to read Barbara's 
daily letter in a warm glow, write a 
cheerful answer for Kitten to carry 
back the next morning, then to bed 
and sound sleep. 
But Hugh did not use much of it; 
he was afraid of the stuff. 
Alcohol, he reasoned, had the ad-
vantage of being a poison. It gave 
fair warning by exacting hangovers 
if one started drinking heavily. But 
this stuff, as Memtok had said, ex-
acted no such price; it merely turned 
anxiety, depression, worry, boredom, 
any unpleasant emotion, into an un-
critical happy glow. Hugh wondered 
if it ·was. principally methyl mepro-
bamate? But he knew little chemistry 
and that little was two thousand 
years behind the times. 
As a member of the executive 
servants' mess he was not rationed; 

he could have all he wanted. But 
Hugh noted that Memtok was not 
the only boss who used the stuff 
most abstemiously. A man did not 
fight his way up in the servants' 
hierarchy by dulling himself with 
drugs -
but sometimes a servant did 
get high up, then skidded all the way 
to the bottom, unable to stand pros-
perity in the form of an unrationed 
supply of "Happiness." Hugh never 
learned what became of them. 
Hugh could even keep a bottle 
in his rooms -
and that solved the 
problem of Kitten. 
Hugh had decided not to ask for 
a separate bed for Kitten; he did not 
want to rub Memtok's nose in the 
fact that he was using the child only 
as a go-between to women's quar-
ters. Instead he required the girl to 
make up a bed each night on the 
comfortable divan in his living room. 
Kitten was very hurt by this. By 
now she was sure that Hugh could 
make better use of a bedwarmer and 
she regarded it as rebuke to her in 
her honorable capacity as comfort 
and solace- and it scared her. If 
her master did not like her, she 
might lose the best job she had ever 
been assigned. (She did not dare 
report to Memtok that Hugh had no 
use for her as a bedwarmer; she 
gave full reports on every point but 
that.) 
She wept. 
She could not have done better; 
Hugh Farnham had been a sucker 
for women's tears all his life. He 
took her on his knee and consoled 
her, and explained that he liked her 
very much (true), that it was a sad, 
sad thing but he was too old prop-
erly to appreciate a female bedmate 
IF 

(a lie), and that he slept badly and 
was disturbed by having anyone in 
bed with him (a half-truth) -
and 
that he was entirely satisfied with 
her and wanted her to go on working 
for him. "Now wipe your eyes and 
have a drink of this." 

He knew that she used the stuff. 

She chewed her ration like bubble 
gum -chewing gum it was in fact; 
the powder was added to chicle and 
most of the servants preferred it that 
way because they could go dreamily 
through the day, chewing it while 
they worked. 
Kitten passed her 
empty days chewing it and chewed 
the played-out cud in Hugh's quar-
ters after she learned he did not 
mind. So he did not hesitate to give 
her a drink of it. 
Kitten went happily to bed and 
right to sleep that night, no longer 
worried that her master might get 
rid of her. That set a precedent. 
Each evening, about half an hour 
before Hugh wanted the lights out, 
he would give her a short drink of 
it. 
For awhile he kept track · of the 
level in the bottle. Kitten was 
often in his quarters when he was 
not, he knew how very much she 
enjoyed it, and there were no locks 
in his quarters. His rank entitled him 
to locks but he did not know this; 
Memtok had carefully not told him. 
He quit bothering when he was 
convinced that Kitten was not snitch-
ing it. In fact, Kitten would have 
been terrified at the thought of 
stealing from her master. Her ego 
was barely big enough for a timid 
mouse; she was less than nothing 
and knew it and had never owned 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

anything, Iiot even a name, until 
Hugh gave her one. Under his kind-
ness she was beginning to be a per-
son, but it was still the faintest 
flicker. Anything could blow it out. 
She would no more have risked 
stealing from him than she would 
have risked killing him. 
Hugh, half by intent, encouraged 
her confidence in other ways. She 
was a trained bath girl, Japanese 
style; he gave in and' let her scrub 
his back and handle the nozzles for 
his bath, dress him, and take care of 
his clothes. She was a masseuse, 
too. He sometimes found it pleasant 
to have his head and neck rubbed 
after a day spent poring over the 
fine print in the encyclopedia or 
following the lines in a scroll read-
er -
and she was pathetically anx-
ious to do anything to make herself 
necessary to him. 

"Kitten, what do you do in the 

daytime?" 

"Why, nothing mostly. Sluts of 
my subcaste mostly don't have to 
work if they have night duty. Since 
I'm having night duty every night 
I'm allowed to stay in the sleep room 
until midday. So I do, even if I'm 
not sleepy, because the slutmaster 
is likely to put one to work if he 
catches one just wandering around. 
Afternoons -
well, mostly I try to 
stay out of sight. That's best. Safest." 

"I see. Well, you can hide out in 
here if you like. Or can you do 
that?" 

Her face lit up. "If you give me 
a pass, I can." 

"All right, I will. You can watch 
television ~ 
no, it's not on at that 
hour. Mmm, you don't know how to 
read. Or do you?" 

"'Oh, no, sir! I wouldn't dare peti-

tion." 

"Hmm." Hugh was aware that 
permission to learn to read could not 
be granted even by Memtok; it re-
quired Their Charity's permission 
and was granted only after investi-
gation of the necessity. Furthermore, 
anything he did that was out of line 
jeopardized his thin chances of re-
union with Barbara. 

But -
damn it, a man bad to be 
a man! "There are plenty of scrolls 
in here and a reader I don't use in 
the daytime. Do you want to learn?" 

"Uncle protect usl" 
"Don't swear. If you want to 
learn -
and can keep your pretty 
little mouth shut about it, I'll teash 
you. Don't look so damned scared! 
You don't have to decide now. Tell 
me later. Just don't talk about it. To 
anyone." 

Kitten did not. That made two 
matters which she did not report to 
the Chief Domestic. It scared her 
not to report it, but she had a re-
flex for self-preservation and felt 
without knowing why that to report 
this would endanger her happy set-
up. 
Kitten became substitute family 
life for Hugh. She sent him to work 
cheerful, greeted him with a smile 
when he came back, talked if he 
wanted to talk and never spoke un-
less spoken to. Most evenings she 
curled up in front of the television 
-Hugh thought of it as "the tele-
vision" and called it by an equiva-
lent word in Language, and it was 
in fact closed-circuit television un-
der principles not known to him, in 
color, in three dimensions, and with-
out lines. 
no 

I t played every cwn!n_g in the 
servants' main hall, from eve-

ning prayer until lights-out, to a 
packed house, and there were out-
lets in the apartments of executive 
servants. Hugh hac! watched it a 
number of evenings, expecting to 
gain insight into this strange society 
he must learn to live in. 
It took him four evenings to de-

cide that one might as well try to 
study the United States he had 
known by watching Gunsmoke. It 
was the most blatant of melodrama, 
with acting as stylized as Chinese 
theater, 
and 
the 
favorite 
plot 
seemed to be that of the faithful 
servant who dies gloriously that his 
lord may live. 
The only good thing Hugh could· 

see about it was that it had no com-
mercials- and that was an acci-
dental virtue: Servants had no mon-
ey to spend. 
But it was only second in impor-

tance to Happiness in the morale of 
life below stairs. Kitten loved it. 

She would watch it, snapping her 
gum monotonously, and sometimes 
suppressing squeals of excitement, 
as Hugh read- then sigh happily 
when the program ended, accept 
her little drink of Happiness with 
profuse thanks and a touch of her 
forehead, and go quietly to sleep 
when told to. Hugh sometimes went 
on reading. 
He read a great deal -
every 
evening (unless Memtok stopped in 
to visit) and half of every day. He 
begrudged the time he spent trans-
lating for Their Charity but never 
neglected it; it was the hopeful key 
to better things. He had found It 
necessacy to do research into mod-
IF 

ern culture if he was to translate 
matters of ancient history intelligi-
bly. The Summer Palace had a fair 
library. He was given access to it 
when he claimed the necessity for 
his work- Memtok arranged it. 
But his true purpose was not 
translation but to try to understand 
what, in the name of all that was 
holy, had happened to his world to 
produce this world. 

So he usually had a scroll in the 
reader, either in his office, or in 
his living room. The scroll system 
of printing he found admirable; it 
mechanized the oldest form of book 
into a system far more efficient than 
bound leaves 
and boards- drop 
the double cylinder into the reader, 
flip it on, and hold still. The letters 
raced across in front of his eyes 
like letters chasing their way around 
the Times building- several hun-
dred feet at a whack, to the end 
of the scroll. Then the scroll flipped 
over and chased back the following 
line, which was printed upside down 
to the one just scanned. 
The eye wasted no time flipping 
back and forth at a stacked column 
of lines. By a slight pressure the 
gadget speeded up to whatever the 
brain could accept. As Hugh got 
used to the phonetics he acquired a 
speed faster than he had ever man-
aged in English. 
But he did not find what he was 
looking for. 
Somewhere in the past the dis-

tinctions between fact, fiction, his-
tory and religious writings seemed 
to have been rubbed out. Even when 
he got it clear that the East-West 
War that had bounced him and his 
out of their own century was now 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

dated 703 B.C. (Before the Great 
Change), he still had trouble match-
ing the world he had known with 
the "history" set forth in 
these 
scrolls. 

~he war itself he didn't find 

~ hard to believe. He had exper-

ienced only a worm's-eye view of 
the first few hours but what the 
scrolls related matched· well enough 
the possibilities: a missile and bomb 
holocaust that had escalated in its 
first minutes into "brilliant first 
strike" and "massive retaliation" and 
smeared cities from Peiping to Chi-
cago, Toronto to Smolensk, fire 
storms that had done ten times the 
damage the bombs did, nerve gas 
and other poisons that had picked 
up where fire left off, plagues that 
were incubating when the shocked 
survivors were picking themselves 
up and beginning to hope- plagues 
that did not stop, diseases that were 
going strong when fallout was no 
longer deadly. 

Yes, he could believe that. The 
bright boys had made it possible. 
And the dull boys they worked for 
had not only never managed to 
make the possibility unlikely but had 
never really believed it when the 
bright boys delivered what the dull 
boys had ordered. 
Not, he reminded himself. that he 
had ever believed in "Better red 
than dead"- or believed in it now. 
The aggression had been one-sided 
as hell. He did not regret a single 
megaton of the "massive retalia-
tion." 

But there it was. The scrolls said 
that it had killed off the whole 
northern world. 

But how about the rest of it? It 
says here that the United States, at 
the time of the war, held its black 
population as slaves. Somebody had 
chopped out a century there. On 
pur!Jose? Or was it honest confusion 
and almost no records? There had 
been, he knew, a great bookburning 
for two centuries during the Tur-
moil, and even after the Change. 
Was it lost history, like Crete? Or 
did the priests like it better this 
way? 
And since when were the Chinese 
classed as "white" and the Hindus 
classed as "black"? Yes, yes, purely 
on skin color Chinese and Japanese 
were as light as the average "white" 
of his time, and Hindus were cer-
tainly as dark as most Africans. But 
it was not the accepted anthropo-
logical ordering, reflected in the vul-
gar terms "white" and "colored" in 
his day. 

Of course, if all they meant was 
skin shade -
and apparently that 
was 
what 
they 
did 
mean -he 
couldn't argue. But the rest of the 
story maintained that the whites, 
with their evil ways, killed each 
other off, destroyed each other al-
most to the last man ... leaving the 
innocent, charitable, merciful dark 
race- beloved 
by 
Uncle 
the 
Mighty -
to inherit the Earth. 
The few white survivors, spared 
by Uncle's. mercy, had been succored 
and cherished as children and now 
agajn were waxing numerous under 
the 
benevolent guidance of the 
Chosen. So it read. 
H "!gh 
could see that a war 
which 
had 
smeared 
all 
of 

NNth America, all of Europe, an 

of Asia except India, could kill off 
most whites and almost all Chinese. 
But what had happened to the white 
minority in South America, the 
whites of the Union ef South Africa, 
and all the Australians and New 
Zealanders? 
Search as he would, Hugh could 
not find out. All that seemed cer-
tain was that the Chosen were all 
equipped 
with 
built-in 
sunburns 
whereas servants were palefaces -
and usually small. Hugh and his son 
towered over the other servants. 
Contrariwise, the few dozen Chosen 
he had seen were big men. 
If the present day whites were de-

scended from Australians, mostly-
No, couldn't be. Aussies had not 
been runts. And those "Expeditions 
of Mercy"- were they slave raids? 
Or pogroms? Or both? Or, literally, 
as the scrQIIs said, rescue missions 
for survivors? 
The Bookburnings might account 
for these discrepancies. It wasn't 
clear to Hugh whether all books had 
been put to the torch, or possibly 
technical books had been spared -
for it was clear that the Chosen had 
technology superior in all the ways 
that he had seen to that of his time; 
it seemed unlikely that they had 
started from scratch and gone still 
farther. 

Or was it unlikely? All the science 
and technology of his own time that 
had amounted to a damn had been 
less than five_ hundred years old, 
most of it less than a hundred, and 
the most amazing parts not more 
than a generation old. Could the 
world have gone back to the dark 
ages, then pulled out of it and more, 
in a span of two thousand years? 
IF 

Of course it could! he thought. 
Either way, the Koran was the 
only book officially exempt from 
the torch during many years of the 
Turmoil- and Hugh harbored a 
suspicion that the Koran had not 
been exempt either. He had owned 
an English translation of the Koran, 
had read it with deep interest sev-
eral times. 
He wished now that he had put 
it into the shelter, for the Koran as 
he now read it in "Language" did 
not match his memory. For one 
thing, he had thought that Mahomet 
was a redheaded Arab. This "Kor-
an" mentioned his skin color re-
peatedly, as black. And he was sure 
that the Koran was free of racism, 
that was one of many things he had 
like about it. This "improved" ver-
sion was rabid with it. 
Furthermore, this Koran had a 
new testament with 
a martyred 
Messiah- or "prophet" might he a 
better word. He had taught and he 
had been hanged for it -
religious 
scrolls were all marked with a gal-
lows. 
Hugh did not object to a new 
testament. There had been plenty 
of time for a new revelation and 
religions usually had them, as natur-
allv as a cat has kittens. What he 
oh)ccted to was some revisionist 
(or many) working over the words 
of the first prophet, apparently (it 
seemed to him) to make them fit 
this new hook. That wasn't fair, that 
was cheating. 
Hugh gave UP trying to sort facts 
from fables. 
Perhaps old Ponse 
would feel mellow enough to dis-
cuss it someday. 
The social organization, as shown 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

by the scrolls, he found almost u 
puzzling. H~ was beginning to get 
a picture of a complex culture, 
stable, even static. High technology, 
few innovations, smooth, efficient 
-and decadent. Church and State 
were one -
"One Tongue, One 

King, One People, One God." The 
Lord Proprietor was both sovereign 
and supreme priest and owned ev-
erything under Uncle's. grant, and 
the Lords Protector such as Ponse 
were merely his bishops and held 
only f.iefs. Yet there were plenty of 
private citizens (Chosen, of course 
-
a white was not a person), pri-
vate shopkeepers, landowners, pro-
fessional men, etc. A setup for an 
absolute 
totalitarian 
communism, 
yet streaked through and through 
with what appeared to be private 
enterprise. Hell, there were even 
corporations if he understood what 
he was reading. 
T he most interesting point to 
Hugh (aside from the dismal 
fact that his own status was fixed 
by law and custom at zero) was the 
inheritance system. Family was ev-
erything, yet marriage was almost 
nothing- present but not impor-
tant. Descent was always through 
the female line -
but power was 
exercised by males. 
This confused Hugh until it sud-
denly all fell into place. Ponse was 
Lord Protector because he was eld-
est son of an eldest daughter-
whose oldest brother had he('n lord 
protector of this fief before Ponse. 
Ponse's heir therefore was hi~ oldest 
sister's oldest son. Descent of title 
went down through mother and 
endlessly with secular power vested 

in the oldest brother of each of 
these female heirs. It did not mat-
ter who Ponse's fatner was and it 
mattered even less what sons he 
bad. None of them could inherit, no 
matter what. Ponse inherited from 
his mother's brother; his heir was 
his sister's son. 
Hugh could see that, under this 
system, marriage would never be 
important- and bastardy might be 
a concept so abstract as to be un-
recognized- but family would be 
more important than ever. Women 
(of the Chosen) could never be 
downgraded under it. They were 
more 
important than males even 
though they ruled through deputies, 
their brothers. And the religion rec-
ognized this; the One God, Uncle 
the Mighty, had an elder sister, the 
Eternal Mamaloi ... so sacred that 
she was not prayed to and her name 
was never used in cursing. She was 
never 
mentioned. 
She 
was 
just 
there, the Eternal Female Principle 
that gave it all life and being. 
Hugh had a feeling that he had 
read about this sort of matrilineal 
descent before, uncle to nephew 
through the female line, and he 
searched the Britannica for it. Then 
he was surprised to discover that the 
setup, or features of it, had pre-
vailed at one time or another in ev-
ery continent and most cultures. 
The 
Great Change had bei!n 

when Mamaloi had at last suceed-
ed- working indirectly, as always 
-" in uniting all Her children under 
one roof and placing their Uncle in 
charge of them. Then She could 
rest. 
Hugh's comment was: "And God 
help the human race!" 

Hugh kept expecting Their Char-

ity to send for him. But two months 
passed and he did not, and Hugh 
was beginning to fret that he would 
never have a chance to ask to see 
Barbara. Apparently Ponse had no 
interest in him as long as he kept 
on grinding out translations. Trans-
lating the Britannica looked to Hugh 
like a job for several lifetimes; he 
resolved to stir things up, so he sent 
one day's batch with a letter to 
Their Charity. 
A week later the Lord Protector 

sent for him. Memtok came 
for Hugh, dancing with impatience 
but insisting that Hugh at least wash 
his armpits, rub himself with deo-
dorant cream and put on a clean 
robe. 
The Lord Protector did not seem 
to care how Hugh smelled. He let 
him stand several minutes while he 
did something else. Hugh stood in 
silence ... although 
Grace 
was 
present. She was lounging on a di-
van, playing with cats and chewing 
gum. She glanced at Hugh, then ig-
nored him, save that her face took 
on a secret smile that Hugh knew 
too well -
he called it "canary that 
ate the cat." 

Dr. - Livingstone - I - Presume 

greeted Hugh, jumping down from 
the divan, coming over and rubbing 
against his ankles. Hugh knew that 
he should ignore it, wait for the lord 
to recognize his presence -but this 
cat had been his friend a long time; 
he could not snub it. He bent down 
and stroked the cat. 
The skies did not split, Their 
Charity ignored the breach. 

Presently the Lord Protector said, 
IF 

"Yes, boy, come here. Now what's 
this about making money from your 
uanslations? What in Uncle ever 
gave you the notion I needed mon-
ey?" 

Hugh had got the notion from 
Memtok. The Chief Domestic had 
growled about how difficult it was 
to run things, with pennypinching 
from on high getting worse every 
year. 

"May it please Their Charity, this 
one's opinions' are of no value, it is 
true, but-" 

"Cut the flowery talk, damn you!" 
"Ponse, I haven't any idea how 
things are here. But back where-
when -I came from there never 
was a man so rich but what he need-
ed more money. Usually, the richer 
he was, the more he needed." 

The lord grinned ruefully. "'Plus

ing Happiness. Things are the same 
now. Well? What's your idea? Spit 
it out." 

"It seems to me that there are 
things in your encyclopedia which 
might be turned to a profit. Pro-
cesses and other thing that have 
been lost in the last two thousand 
years- but might be worth money 
now." 

"All right, do it. The stuff you

had time to read. But some of it ia 
trivial. 'Smith, John, born and died 
-
a politician who did nothing 

much and did that little poorly.' 
Know what I mean?" 

"I think so, Ponse." 
"All right, skip that garbage and 
dig me up four or five juicy ideas 
I can cash in on."

Hugh 
hesitated. 
Ponse 
said, 

"\' .. ell'? Didn't you understand?" 

"I think I need help. You see, I 
don't know anything, anything at 
all. really, except what goes on be-
low stairs. I thought Joe might help." 

"How?" 
"I understand that he has traveled 
some with you, seen things. And he 
reads English. He is mor:e likely to 
be able to pick out subjects that 
merit study. He could pick the ar-
ticle:>, I will translate them, and you 
can judge whether or not 'ltere is 
anything to exploit. I can synopsize 
them, too, so that you needn't waste 
your time wading through details if 
the subject doesn't merit it." 

"Good idea. I'm sure Joe will be 
happy to help. All right, send up 
the encyclopedia. All." 

Hugh was dismissed so abruptly 
that he had no chance to mention 
Barbara. But, he reflected, he could 
not have risked it with Grace pres-
ent. 
He considered digging out Duke, 
telling him that his mother was fat 
and 
happy -
both 
literally -
but decided against it. He wasn't 
sure how pleased Duke would be 
with a truthful report, and wanted 
no argument. They didn't see eye to 
eye and that was that.

'Joe sent · back down a volume 
almost every day for many 

days,· with pages marked and ar-
ticles checked; Hugh slaved very 
hard to try to keep up with him, 
and to make really useful transla-
tions. After two weeks of' this Hugh 
was again sent for. 

He expected a conference over 
some business idea. What he !'ound 
was Ponse, Joe, and a Chosen he 
had never seen. Hugh instantly prO-
pared to speak protocol mode, ris-
ing. 
The Lord Protector said. "Come 

here, Hugh. Cut the carus. And 
don't start any of that tiresome for-
mality, this is all family. Private." 

Hugh itesitantly approached. The 
other Chosen, a big dark man with 
a permanent scowl, didn't seem 
pleased at the idea. He was carrying 
his quirt and twitched it. But Joe 
looked up and smiled. "I've been 
teaching them contract, Hugh, and 
our usual fourth had to be away. 
I've been telling Ponse that you are 
the best player any where or when. 
So don't let me down." 

"I'll try not to." Hugh recognized 
one deck of cards, they had once 
been his. The o.ther deck appeared 
to be handpainted on plastic and 
were quite beautiful. The table was 
the right height and size, but was 
not from the shelter; fabulous hand 
craftsmanship had gone into it. 
The cut made Hugh partner of 
the strange Chosen. Hugh tried not 
show how nervous it made him, es-
pecially as his partner clearly did 
not like it. But the Chosen grunted 
and accepted it. 
His partner's contract at three 
spades- by 
a 
fluke 
distribu-

tion they made four. His partner 
growled. "Boy, you underbid. you 
wasted game. Don't let it happen 
again." 

Hugh kept quiet and dealt. 
On the next hand Joe and Ponse 

made five clubs. Hu<!h's partner was. 
furious- at Hugh. "If you had led 

IF 

diamonds, we would have set ·them! 

jf~Jd you washed out our leg. I 

~arned you. Now fm-" 
· · "Mrika!" 
Ponse 
said 
sharp-

ly. "This is contract. Play it as such. 
And put that tickler out of reach. 
The servant played correctly." 

"It did not! And I'm damned if I 
care for the idea of letting it in the 
game anyhow. I can smell the rank, 
sharp stink of a buck servant no 
matter how much it's scrubbed. And 
I don't think this one is scrubbed at 
all." 

Hugh felt sweat breaking out in 
his armpits and flinched. But Ponse 
said evenly, "Very well. we excuse 
you. You may leave." 

"That suits me!" The Chosen 
stood up. "Just one thing before I 
go. If you don't quit stalling, Their 
Mercy will let the Northwestern 
Protectorate -" 

"Are you planning to put up the 

money?" Their Charity said sharply. 
· "Me? It's a Family matter. Not 
but what I wouldn't jump at the 
chance if I could beg, borrow, or 
scrape up the bullocks. Forty mil-
lion hectares and more, and most 
of it in prime timber- of course 
I would! But I hardly have one bul-
locks to jingle against another-
and you know why." 

"Certainly we know why. You 

gamble." 
_ 

"Oh, come now! A businessman 
has to take chances. You :an't call 
it gambling when -" 

"We do 'call it gambling. We do 
not object to gambling but we have 
a vast distaste for losing. If you 
must lose, you will do tt with your 
own bullocks." 

"But this isn't gambling, it's a sure 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

thing -
as well as getting us in solid 
with Their Mercy. The Family-" 

"We will decide what is goCtd for 
the Family. For a while longer at 
least. Your turn will come soon 
enough. In the meantime we are as 
anxious to please the Lord Proprie-
tor as you are. But not with bullocks 
the Family doesn't have in the trea-
sury." 

"You could borrow it. The inter-

est would only come to -" 

"You wanted to leave, Mrika. We 
note that you have left." Ponse 
picked up cards and began to shuf-
fle them. 
fhe younger Chosen snorted and 
left. 
Ponse laid out a solitaire game, 
started to play. Presently he 
said to Joe, "Sometimes that young 
man gets me so annoyed that I 
would happily change my will." 

Joe looked puzzled. "I thought 
you could not disinherit him?'' 

"Oh, no, no!" Their Charity look-

ed shocked. "Not even a peasant can 
do that. Where woulds we be if there 
were no stability here on Earth? I 
wouldn't dream of it, even if the 
law permitted it; be's my heir. I 
was just thinking of the servants." 

Joe said, "I don't follow you." 
"Why you know- No, perhaps 
you don't. I keep forgetting that 
you didn't grow up among us. My 
will disposes of anything personally 
mine. Not much I grant you- jew-
elry, scrolls, such. Value probably 
less than a million. Trivia. Except 
household servants. Just the house-
bold, I'm not talking about servants 
in mines or on ranches, or in . our 
shipping lines. It's customary to list 

all household servants in a will--
otherwise they escort their uncle." 
He grinned. "It would be ,1 good 
joke on Mrika if he suddenly learned 
that he was going to have to find 
the money somewhere to adopt fif-
teen hundred, two thousand ser-
vants -
or shut up the house and 
live in a tent. I can just >ee that. 
Why, I doubt if he knows how to 
put on his own boots. Hugh, if you 
tell me to put the black lady on the 
red lord, I'll tingle you, I promise. 
I'm not in a good mood." 

Hugh said hastily, "Did you miss 
a play? I hadn't noticed." 

"Then why were you staring at 
the cards?" Hugh had indeed been 
staring at the game, trying his best 
to be invisible. He had been made 
very nervous by witnessing a quar-
rel between Ponse and his nephew. 
He hoped never to see the younger 
Chosen again -
the man might re-

member him. But he had missed not 
a word, he found it extremely in-
teresting. 
Ponse went on, "Which would 
you prefer, Hugh? To escort me to 
Heaven? Or stay here and serve 
Mrika? Don't answer too quickly. 
If you stay here, I venture you may 
be eating your own toes to stay your 
hunger before I'm gone a year ... 
whereas Heaven is 
a very nice 
place, so the Good Scroll tells us." 

"It's a ha"rd choice." 
"Well, you don't have to make it. 
nor will you know. A servant should 
never know, it keeps him on his toes. 
That scoundrel Memtok keeps pray-
ing me for the honor of being in my 
escort. If I thought he was sincere, 
I would dismiss him for incompe-
tence. But he isn't." Ponse swept the 

cards together, having reached a 
block. "Damn that lad! He's poor 
company but I had my liver set on a 
few good, hard rubbers. Joe, we've 
got to teach more people to play 
contract. Being left without a fourth 
is annoying." 

"Certainly," agreed Joe. "Right 

now?" 

"No, no. I want to play, damn it, 
not watch some beginner bumble 
through it. I'm growing addicted to 
it. Takes a man's worries off his 
mind." 
Hugh 
was hit 
by inspiration. 

"Ponse, if you don't mind hav-
ing another servant in the game ... " 

Joe brightened up. 
"Why, of 
course! He...,.." 

"Barbara," Hugh cut in fast, be-

fore Joe could mention Duke. 
Joe blinked. Then he smoothly 
picked where he had left off. "He -
Hugh, I mean- was about to men-
tion 
a 
servant 
named 
Barbara. 
Good bridge player." 

"Well! You've been teaching this 
game below stairs, Hugh?" Ponse 
added, " 'Barbara'? A name I don't 
recognize. Ncit one of the upper 
servants, I'm sure." 

"You remember her," Joe said. 

"She was with us when you picked 
us up. The tall one." 

"Oh, yes. Digging, it was. But, 
Joe, are you telling me that a slut 
can play this game?" 

"She's a top player," Joe assured 
him. "Plays better than I do. Heav-
ens, 
Ponse, she can play rings 
around you. Isn't that right, Hugh?" 

"Barbara is an excellent player." 
"This I must see to believe." 
A few minutes later Barbara, 
IF 

freshly 
bathed 
and 
scared, 
was 
fetched in. She glanced at Hugh, 
looked startled silly, opened her 
mouth, closed it, and stood mute. 

Ponse came up to her. "So this is 
the slut who is supposed to be able 
to play contract. Stop trembling, lit-
tle one; nobody's going to eat you." 
In a few bluff words, confirmed by 
Joe, he convinced her that she was 
there to play bridge and that she 
was expected to relax and be infor-
mal- no fancy talk. "Just behave 
as if you were downstairs. having a 
good 
time 
with 
other 
servants. 
Hear me?" 

"Yes, sir." 
"Just one thing." He tapped her 
on her chest. "When you're my part-
ner, I shan't be angry if you make a 
mistake or two. After all, you're 
only a slut and it's surprising that 
you can play an intellectual game 
at all. But-" He paused. "But ... 
when you are playing against me, if 
you fail to fight for every trick, if 
I even suspect that you are trying to 
let me win, I guarantee you'll tingle 
when you leave. Understand me?" 

"That's right," agreed Joe. "Their 

Charity expects it. You just play by 
the book. and play your best." 

" 'Play by the book,' " Ponse re-

peated. "I've never seen this book 
Joe talks about; but that's the way 
Joe says he has taught me to play. 
So do it. All right. let's cut the 
cards." 

Hugh hardly listened, he was 
drinking in the .sight of Barbara. 
She looked well and healthy al-
though it was startling to see her 
slender again- or almost slender, 
he corrected; she was still largish 
in the fanny and certainly in the 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

bust. She had lost most of her tan 
and was dressed in the shapeless 
short robe that all female servants 
wore below stairs, but he was de-
lighted to see that she had not had 
her hair removed. It was close 
cropped but it could grow back. 
He noticed that his own appear-

ance seemed to startle her, realized 
why. He said, smiling, "Yes, I comb 
my hair with a washrag now, Bar-
bie. No matter, I didn't have enough 
left to be more than a nuisance. 
Now that I'm used to being hair-
less, I like it." 

"You look distinguished, Hugh." 
"He's ugly as sin," said Ponse. 

"But are we chatting? Or playing 
bridge? Your bid, Barba." 
T hey played bridge for hours. 
As 
it 
progressed, 
Barbara 
seemed to relax and enjoy it. She 
smiled a great deal, usually at Hugh, 
but also at Joe and even at Their 
Charity. She played by the book 
and Ponse never found fault with 
her. Hugh decided that their host 
was a good run-of-the-mill player, 
not yet perfect in his play- but he 
was smart, always remembered what 
cards had been played, and usually 
bid quite accurately, by the book. 
Hugh found him a satisfactory part-
ner and an adequately strong oppo-
nent; it was a good game. 
But once, with Barbara as Ponse's 
partner and contract in her hand, 
Hugh saw as soon as Ponse laid 
down the dummy that Ponse had 
overbid in his answer by at least 
one trick. So he contrived to play 
so that he lost one sure trick, there-
by letting Barbara make contract, 
game, and rubber. 

It got him a glance with r•J ex-
pression from Barbara and Joe gave 
him a look that had a suggestion of 
a twinkle in it, but Joe kept his 
mouth shut. Ponse did not notice. 
He gave a bass roar of satisfaction, 
reached across and patted Barbara's 
head. "Wonderful, wonderful! Little 
one, you really can play contract. 
Why, I doubt if I could have made 
that one myself." 

Nor did Ponse complain when, on 
the next rubber, Barbara and Hugh 
gave him and Joe a trouncing. Hugh 
decided that Ponse had the inborn 
:honesty sometimes called "s.ports-

mans~1ip"- plus quite a good head 
for carJs. 

One of the little deaf-mutes trot-
ted in, knelt, and served Their Char-
ity a tumbler of something cold, 
then another to Joe. Ponse took a 
long swig, wiped his mouth and 
said, "Ah, that hits the spot!" 

Joe made a quiet, almost wltis-

percd suggestion to him. 
Ponse 

looked startled and said, "Oh, cer-
tainly. Why not?" 

So 
Hugh 
and 
Barbara 
were 
served, too. Hugh was pleased to dis-
cover that it was just cold apple 
juice; he wasn't sure of his ability 
to play tight bridge had it been 
Happiness." 
During this rubber Hugh noticed 
that Barbara was squirming a little 
and seemed to have trouble in con-
centrating. When the hand ended 
he said quietly, "Trouble, bon?" 

She glanced at Ponse and whis-

pered quickly, "Some. I was about 
to feed the boys when I was sent 
for." 

"Oh." Hugh turned to his host. 

"Ponse, Barbara needs to stop." 

Ponse looked up from shuffling. 

"Plumbing call! One of the maids 
can show it, I suppose. They must 
go somewhere." 

"Not that. Well, maybe that, too. 
But .what I meant was, Barbara bas 
twins." 

"Well? Sluts usually have twins, 
they have two breasts. What do you 
expect?" 

"That's the point, she's nursing 
them and she's hours past time for 
.it. She has to leave." 

Ponse looked annoyed, hesitated, 
then said, "Oh, garbage. Its milk 
won't cake from so short a delay. 
Here, cut the cards." · 

Hugh did not touch them. Ponse 

said, "Didn't you hear me?" 

Hugh stood up. His heart was 

beating very fast and he felt a shud· 
der of fear. "Ponse, Barbara hurts. 
She needs to nurse her twins right 
now. I may not be able to force 
you to let her -
but if you think 
I'll play cards with you while you 
don't let her, you're crazy." 
F or long moments the big man 

simply stared, without expres-

sion. Then suddenly he grinned. 
"Hugh I like you, I really do. You 
did something like this once before, 
didn't you? The slut is your sister, 
I suppose." 

"No." 
"Then you are the one who is 

crazy. Do you know how close you 
came to being cold meat?" 

"I can guess." 
"I doubt it, you don't look W6r· 

ried. But I like spunk, even .in a 
servant. Very well, I'll have its brats 
fetched. They can be fed while !I'D 
play." 

If 

The twins were fetched and Hugh 

aaw at once that they were the most 
perfect, handsomest, healthiest and 
loveliest boy babies that had ever 
been born; he told Barbara so. But 
he did not immediately get a chance 
to touch them as Ponse took one in 
each arm, laughed at them, blew 
in their faces and jiggled them. 
"Fine boys!" he roared. "Fine boys, 
Barba! Holy little terrors, I'll bet. 
Go on, swing that fist, kid! Sock 
Uncle in the nose again. What do 
you call them, Barba? Do they have 
names?" 

"This one is Hugh-" 
"Eh? Does Hugh have something 
to do with them? Or thinks he has, 
perhaps?" 

"He's their father." 
"Well, well! Hugh. you may be 
ugly. but you have other qualities. 
If Barba knows what she's talking 
about. And.what's this one's name?" 

"That one is little Joe. Karl Jo· 

aeph." 

Ponse lifted an eyebrow at Joe. 
"So you have sluts naming brats for 
you, eh, Joe? I'll have to watch you, 
you're a sly one. What did you give 
Barba?" 

"Beg pardon?" 
"Birthing present. you idiot. Noth-

ing? Give her that ring you're wear-
ing. So many 'brats in this house 
named after me that I have to or-
der trinkets by the basket load; they 
all know it obliges me to make them 
a present. Hugh here is lucky, he 
has nothing to give. Hey, Hughie 
bas teeth already." 

Hugh got to hold them for a mo· 

ment while they settled down for 
combined bridge and nursing. Bar-
bara took them one at a time and 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

played cards with her free hand. 
The little maids fussed over the one 
not nursing and, in due time, took 
them away. In spite of the handicap 
Barbara managed to play well, even 
brilliantly; the long session ended 
with Ponse top scorer, Barbara close 
behind, and Joe and Hugh tied for 
anchor position. Hugh had cheated 
very little to make it come out that 
way; the cards had favored Ponse 
and Barbara when they were part· 
ners; they had made two small slams, 
the only slams· of the session. 
Ponse was feeling very jovial 
about it. "Barba, come here, little 
one. You tell the slutmaster that I 
said to find a wet nurse for your 
brats and that I want the vet to dry 
you up as soon as possible, hear. 
me? I want you available as my 
bridge partner. Or opponent- you 
give a man a tough fight." 

"Yes, si:r.. May one speak?" 
"One may." 
"I would rather nurse them my-

self. They're all I have." 

"Well-" He shrugged.· "This 

seems to be my day for balky ser-
vants. I'm afraid you are both sti11 
savages at heart. A tingling wouldn't 
do you any harm, slut. All right, 
but you'll have to play one-handed 
sometimes; I won't have brats stop-
ping the game." He grinned. "Be-
sides, I'd like to see the little rascals 
occasionally, especially that one that 
bites. You may go. All." 
Barbara was dismissed so sud-

denly that Hugh barely had 
time to exchange smiles with her. 
He had hoped to walk down with 
her, steal a little private visit. Bqt 
His Charity did not dismiss him, so 

he stayed -
with a warm glow in 
his heart; it had been the happiest 
time he had had in a long time. 
Ponse discussed the articles he 
had been translating, why none of 
them offered practical new business 
ventures. "But don't fret about it, 
Hugh. Keep plugging away and we'll 
strike ore yet." He turned the talk 
to other matters, still kept Hugh 
there. Hugh found him a knowl-
edgeable conversationalist, interest-
ed in everything, as willing to lis-
ten as he was to talk. He seemed to 
Hugh the epitome of the perfect 
decadent gentleman -urbane, cos-
mopolitan, disillusioned and cyni-
cal, a dilettant in all arts and sci-
ences, neither merciful nor cruel, 
unimpressed by his own rank, and 
not racist. At least he treated Hugh 
as an intellectual equal in private 
conversation. 

While they were talking, the little 
maids came in and served dinner to 
Ponse and to Joe, at the card table 
where they had remained. Nothing 
was offered to Hugh, nor did he ex-
pect it -nor want it, as he could 
always have meals served in his 
rooms if he was not on time in the 
executive servants' dining room and 
he had long since decided, from sev-
eral samplings, that Memtok was 
right: The upper servants ate better 
than the master. 
But when Ponse had finished, he 
shoved his dishes toward Hugh. 
"Eat." 

Hugh hesitated a split second; 
he did not need to be told that he 
was being honored -
for a ser-
vant. There was plenty of food, 
at least three times as much left 
as Ponse bad eaten. Hugh could 

not recall that be had ever in his 
life eaten someone's leavings, and 
certainly not with a used spoon. 
But he dug in. 
As usual, Their Charity's menu 
did not especially please Hugh -
somewhat greasy and be had no 
great liking for pork. Pork was hard-
ly ever served below stairs but was 
often part of the menus Memtok 
sampled, Hugh had noticed. It sur-
prised him, as the revised Koran 
these people used still contained 
the dietary laws and the Chosen 
did follow some of the original Mus-
lim customs. They practiced cir-
cumcision, did not use alcohol oth-
er than a thin beer, and observed 
Ramadan at least nominally and 
still called it that. Mahomet would 
have been shocked by the accre-
tions and revisions to his straight-
forward monotheistic teaching but 
nevertheless he would have recogni-
zed some of tpe details. 
But the bread was good, the fruits 
were superb, and so were the ices 
and many other things; it wasn't 
necessary to dine solely on the 
roast. Hugh kept intact his record 
for enjoying the inevitable. 
Ponse was interested in what the 
climate had been in this region in 
Hugh's time. "Joe tells me you 
sometimes had freezing tempera-
tures. Even snow." 

"Oh, yes, hoth, every winter." 
"Fantastic. How cold did it get?" 
Hugh had to stop to think. He 
had not yet had occasion to learn 
how these people marked tempera-
tures. "If you consider the range 
from freezing of water to its boil-
ing, it was not especially unusual for 
IF 

it to get one third of that range 
lower than freezing." 
Ponse looked surprised. "Are you 
sure? We call that range, freezing 
to boiling, one hundred. Are you tell-
ing me that it sometimes got as 
much as thirty-three degrees below 
freezing?" 

Hugh noted with interest that the 
centigrade scale had survived two 
millenia -
but no reason why it 

mould not; they used the decimal 
system in arithmetic and in their 
money. He had to do a conversion 
in his head. "Yes, that's exactly 
what I mean. Nearly cold enough 
to freeze mercury, and often cold 
enough for that, up in those moun-
tains." Hugh pointed out a view 
window. 

"Cold enough," Joe agreed, "to 

freeze your teeth! Only thing that 
ever made me long for Mississippi." 

"Where," asked Ponse, "is Missis-

lippi?" 

"It's not," Joe told him. "It's un-

der water now. And good riddance." 
~ 
led to discussion of why 

J. the climate had changed and 
Their Charity sent for the last vol-
ume of the Britannica, containing 
ancient 
maps, 
and 
for 
modem 
maps. They poured over them to-
gether. Wliere the Mississippi Val-
ley had been, the Gulf now reached 
far north. It was no longer a gulf 
but part of the Atlantic as Florida 
and Yucatan were missing and Cuba 
was a few small islands. California 
had a central sea and most of north-
em Canada was gone. 

Similar 
shrinkages 
had 
taken 
place elsewhere. The Scandinavian 
Peninsula was now a great island. 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

The British Isles were several small 
islands. Part of the Sahara was un-
der water. What had been lowlands 
anywhere were missing- Holland, 
Belgium, northern Germany could 
not be found. Nor Denmark -
the 
Baltic was a gulf of the Atlantic. 
Hugh looked at it with odd sor-

row and had never felt so home-
sick. He had known it was so, fro::-~ 
reading; this was the first map he 
had seen of il 

"The question," said Ponse, "is 

whether the melting of the ice was 
triggered by the explosions and diJst 
of the East-West War, or was it a 
natural change that was, at most, 
simply speeded up a little by artifi-
cial events? Some of my scientists 
say one thing, some the other." 

"What do 
you think?" asked 
Hugh. 
The lord shrugged. "I'm not fool-

ish enough to hold an opinion when 
I have insufficient data; I'll leave 
that folly to scientists. I'm simply 
glad that Uncle saw fit to let me 
live in an age in which I can go 
outdoors without freezing my feet. 
I visited the South Pole once -
I 
have some mines there. Frost on the 
ground. Dreadful. The place for ice 
is in a drink." 

Ponse went to the view window 
and stood looking out at the silhou-
ette of mountains against darkening 
sky. "However, if it got that cold up 
there now, we would root them out 
in a hurry. Eh, Joe?" 

"They would come back with 
their tails between their legs," Joe 
agreed. 
Hugh looked 
puzzled. 
"Ponse 

means," Joe explained, "the runn~rs 
hiding up in the mountains. What 

they thought you were when we 
were found." 

"Runners and a few aborigines," 
Ponse 
supplemented. 
"Savages. 

Poor creatures who have never been 
rescued by civilization. It's very 
hard to save them, Hugh. They 
don't stand around in the open and 
wait to be picked up the way you 
did. They're as crafty as wolves. 
Caves and things, and the merest 
shadow in the sky and they freeze 
and you can't see them -and they 
are very destructive of game. Of 
course we could smoke them out any 
number of ways. But that would kill 
off the game, can't have that. Hugh, 
you've lived out there in the open; 
you must have acquired some feel 
for it. How would you go about res-
cuing those critters? Without killing 
the game." 

Mr. 
Hugh 
Farnham 
hesitated 
only long enough to phrase his re-
ply. "Their Charity knows that this 
one is a servant. This one's ears 
must be at fault in thinking that it 
heard its humble self caUed on to 
see the problem as it might appear 
to the Chosen." 

"Why, damn your impudence for 
dodging around it with fancy talk. 
Hugh, I want your opinion." 

"You got my opinion, Ponse. I'm 
a servant. I know it, you know it. 
My sympathies are with the run-
aways. And the savages. I didn't 
exactly come here willingly, you 
know. I was dragged." 

"surely you aren't resenting that 
now? Of course you were cap-
tured, even Joe was. But there was 
language difficulty. Now you've seen 
the difference. You know." 

"Yes. I know," Hugh replied. 
"Then you certainly know how 
much your condition has improved. 
Don't you sleep in a better bed 
now? Aren't you eating better? Un-
cle! When we picked you up, you 
were half starved and infested with 
vermin. You were barely staying 
alive with the hardest sort of work, 
I could see. I'm not blind, I'm not 
stupid. There isn't a member of my 
Family down to the lowest and dull-
est cleaner that works half as hard 
as you had to, or sleeps in as poor 
a bed -
and in a stinking little sty; 
I could hardly bear the stench be-
fore we fumigated it. And as for 
the food, if that is the word, any ser-
vant in this house would turn up his 
nose at what you ate. Right?" 

"Yes." 
"Well?" 
"I prefer freedom." 
"'Freedom!'" Their Charity snort-
ed. "A concept without a referent, 
like 'ghosts.' Meaningless. Hugh, you 
should study semantics. Modern se-
mantics, I mean; I doubt if they 
hlill such a science in your day, 
really. We are all free--to walk 
our appointed paths. Jus.t as a stone 
is free to fall when you toss it into 
the air. No one is free in the purely 
abstract meaning you give the word. 
Do you think I am free? Free to 
change places with you, say? Would 
I if I could? You bet I would! You 
have no concept of the worries J 
have, the work I do. Sometimes I 
lie awake half the night, worrying 
about which way to turn next- and 
you won't find that in servants' hall. 
They're happy, they have no wor-
ries. But I have to carry my burden 
as best I can." 

lF 

Hugh looked stubborn. 
Ponse 
came over and put his arm around 
Hugh's shoulders. "Come, let's sit 
down and talk this over, judicially, 
not emotionally -
two civilized be-

ings. I'm not one of those supersti-
tious persons who thinks a man 
can't think because his skin is pale. 
Surely you know that. Haven't I 
respected your intellect?" 

"Well ... yes." 
"That's better. But I happen to 
know more about this than you do. 
Let me explain some things- Joe 
has seen them -
and you can ask 
questions if you need to, and we'll 
arrive at a rational understanding. 
First- Joe, you've seen the Chos-
sen here and there who are what 
our friend Hugh would. no doubt de-
scribe as 'free.' Tell him." 
Joe snorted. "Hugh, you should 
see. You would be darn glad to be 
privileged to live in Ponse's house-
hold. There is just one phrase I can 
think of to describe them. Po' 
black trash. Like the white trash 
not knowing where their next meal 
is coming from." 

"I follow you." 
"I think I do, too," agreed Their 
Charity. "A pungent phrase. I look 
forward to the day when every 
man will have servants. But it can't 
come oven1ight, they'll have to lift 
themselves up. But a day when all 
the Chosen will be served -
and all 
servants as well cared for as I know 
they are in my Family. That's my 
ideal. In the meantime I do the best 
I can. I look after their welfare 
from 
birth 
until 
they're 
called 
Home by Uncle. They have noth-
ing to fear, utter security- which 
they wouldn't have out in those 

FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 

mountains as I'm sure you know 
better than I. They are happy, they 
are never overworked -
which I 
am -
and they have plenty of fun, 
which is more than I can say! This 
bridge game today- the first real 
fun I've had in a m0··•h. And they 
are never punished, only just enough 
to remind them when they .. err. 
Have to do that, you've seen how 
stupid most of them ar.e. Not that 
I am inferring that you are. No, r 
tell you honestly that I think you 
are smart enough to take care of 
servants yourself, despite your· skin. 
I'm speaking of the ordinary run of 
them. Honestly, Hugh, do you think 
they could possibly take care of 
them as well as I look out for 
them?" 

"probably not." Hugh was think-
ing that he had heard all this 
before, only a few nights ago, anci 
in almost the same words -
from 
Memtok. With the slight difference 
that Ponse did seem to be honestly 
fond of his servants and earnest 
about their welfare -
whereas the 
Chief Domestic had been openly 
contemptuous of them, even more 
strongly so than his barely veiled 
contempt for the Chosen. "No, they 
couldn't. most of them." 

"Ah! You agree with me." 
"No." 
Ponse looked pained. "Hugh, how 
can we have a rational discussion if 
you say one thing and contradict it 
in the next breath?" 

"I didn't contradict myself. I 
agreed that you took fine care of 
the welfare of your servants. But I 
did not agree that I prefer it to free-
dom. I don't." 

"But tell me why, Hugh? Give me 
a concrete reason, not a philosophi-
cal abstraction. If you're not happy, 
I want to know why. So that I can 
correct it." 

"I can give you one good reason. 
I'm not allowed to live with my wife 
and children." 

"Eh?" 
"Barbara. And the twins." 
"Oh. But is that really important 
to you? You have a bedwarmer. I 
know you have; Memtok told me, 
and I congratulated him on having 
used initiative in an odd situation. 
Not much gets past that sly old fox. 
You have one and she is sure to be 
more expert at her specialty than 
the ordinary run of breeding slut. 
As for the brats, no reason why 
you can't see them all you wish-
just order them fetched to you 
whenever you like. But who wants 
to live with brats? Or with a wife? 
I don't live with my wife and chil-
dren, you can bet on that. I see 
them on appropriate occasions. But 
who would want to live with them?" 

"I would." 
"Well -
Uncle! I want you to be 
happy. It can be arranged." 

"It can?" 
"Certainly. If you hadn't put up 
such a fuss over being tempered, 
you could have had them with you 
all along- though I confess I don't 
see why. Do you want to see the 
vet?" 

"Uh ... no." 
"Well. there's always the other 
choice. I'll have the slut spayed." 

"NO." 
Ponse sighed. "You're a hard one 
to please. Be practical, Hugh; I 
can't change a scientific breeding 

system developed over centuries to 
pamper one servant. Do you know 
how many servants are in this fam-
ily? Here and at the Palace? Some-
where around eighteen hundred, I 
believe. Do you know what would 
happen if I 
allowed unrestricted 
breeding? In ten years there would 
be twice that number. Do you know 
what would happen next? They'd 
starve, that's what would happen. I 
can't support them in unlimited 
breeding. Would if I could, but it's 
wishing for the Moon. Worse, for 
we can go to the Moon any time 
it's worth while but nobody yet has 
been able to cope with the way ser-
vants will breed if left to their own 
devices. So which is better? To con-
trol the breeding? Or let them 
starve?" 
T heir Charity sighed and went 
on. "I wish yau were a head 
shorter, we could work something 
out. You've been .in studs' quarters?" 

"I visited it once, with Memtok," 

said Hugh. 

"You noticed the door? You had 
to stoop; Memtok walked straight 
in. He used to be a stud. The 
doors are that height in every studs' 
barracks in the world -
and no ser-

vant is chosen if he can't walk in 
without stooping. And the slut in 
this case is too tall, too. A wise law, 
Hugh, but I didn't make it; it was 
handed down by Their Mercy of 
that time, a long time ago. If they 
are allowed to breed too ta!l they 
start needing to be tingled too often 
and that's not good, either for mas-
ter or servant. No, Hugh. Anything 
within reason. But don't ask for the 
impossible." He moved from the di-
IF 

van where he had been sitting tete-a-
tete with Hugh, and sat down at the 
oard table, picked up one deck. "So 
we'll say no more about it. Do you 
know how to play doubie solitaire?" 

"Yes." 
"Then come see if you can beat 
me a game and let's be cheerful. A 
man gets upset when his efforts 
aren't appreciated." 

Hugh shut up and 'tt down with 
him. He was thinking glumly that 
Ponse was not a villain, not at all. 
He was exactly like the members of 
every other ruling class in history: 
honestly convinced of his own be-
nevolence and hurt if it was chal-
lenged. 
They played a game. Hugh lost, 
his mind was not on it. They start-
ed to lay out another. Their Char-
ity remarked, "I must havl! more 
cards 
painted. 
These are getting 
worn and sticky." 

Hugh said. "Couldn't it be done 
more quickly, using a printi!r such 
as we use for scrolls?" 

"Eh? I suppose so. Hadn't thought 
about it." The big man rubbed one 
of the XXth century .:ards. "This 
doesn't seem much like printing. 
Are they printed? Were they, 
I 

mean?" 

"Oh, yes. Many thousands at a 
time. Millions, ptrhaps I should £ay, 
figuring the enormous numbers that 
used to be sold." 

"Really? I wouldn't have thought 
that bridge, with its jemand on the 
intellect, would have attracted many 
people." 

Hugh suddenly put down 
his 

cards. "Ponse? You wanted a way 
to make money." 

"Certainly." 

FARNHAM'S FREBHOLD 

"You're holding it 
in your 

h.and. Brand new. In thi! 

age. 
Joe! 
Come here 
and let's 
talk about this. How many 
deck~ 

of playing cards were sold each 
year in the United States?" 

"Gosh, Hugh, I don't know. Mil-

lions, maybe." 

"So I· would say. And .at a grost 

profit of about 90~1o on each deck, 
too. Mmm. Ponse, bridge and soli-
taire aren't the only games that can 
be played with these cards. The 
possibilities are unlimited. There are 
simple games, simple as solitaire but 
played by two or three or more 
players. There are games a dozen 
people can play at once. There are 
hard games and easy games, there 
/is even a form of bridge- 'dupli-
cate ' it's called- which is harder 
tha~ contract, for people who like 
to work hard when they play Ponse, 
every family -little family, I mean 
-in the United States kept one or 
two or even dozens of decks of these 
cards on hand; it was a rare home 
that didn't own a single deck. I 
couldn't guess how many were sold. 
Probably at least a hundr-ed million 
decks in use in the United States 
alone. 
And you've got a virgin 
market. All it needs is to get people 
interested in playing with cards." 

"Ponse, Hugh is right." Joe said 
solemnly. "The possibilities are un-
limited." 

Ponse pursed up his lips. ·'If we 
sold them for a bullock a deck, let 
us say ... mmm -" 

"Too much," Joe objected. "You 

would kill your market before you 
got started." 

Hugh said, "Joe, what's this for-

mula for setting a price to maximize 
profits rather than sales?" 

"Works only if you have a mo-

nopoly." 

"Well? How is that done here? 
Patents and copyrights and such? I 
haven't read anything about it." 

J9e looked troubled. "Hugh, the 
Chosen don't use such a system. 
You see, they don't need to. Every-
thing is pretty well worked out, 
things don't change much." 

Hugh said, "That's bad. Two 
weeks after we start the market will 
be flooded with cheap imitations." 

Ponse said, "What are you two 
jabbering about? Speak Language." 
Hugh's first question had necessari-
ly been in English; he knew 'lO other 
words for what he wanted to ask. 
Joe had answered in English. 
Joe said, "Sorry, Ponse," and ex-

plained the ideas behind patent 
rights, copyright, and monopoly. 

Ponse relaxed. "Oh, that's simple. 
When a man gets an inspiration 
from Heaven, the LOrd Proprietor 
recognizes it and forbids anyone 
else to use it without his let. Doesn't 
happen often, I recall only two 
cases in my lifetime. But Mighty 
Uncle has been known to ·smile." 

Hugh was not surprised to learn 
how scarce invention was. It was a 
static culture at best, with most of 
what they called "science" in the 
hands of tempered slaves. And if 
patenting a 'new idea was that dif-
ficult, there would be little incen-
tive to invent. "Would you say that 
this idea is an inspiration from 
Heaven?" 

Ponse thought about it. "A true 
inspiration is whatever. Their Mercy, 
in Their wisdom, recognizes as an 

inspirations." Suddenly he grinned. 
"In my opinion, anything -that will 
stack bullocks in the Family coffers 
is certainly an inspiration. The prob-
lem is to make the Proprietor see 
it. But there are ways, there are 
ways. 
That's 
my 
problem, 
not 
yours. Keep talking." 
Joe said, "Hugh, the 
should extend not 
playing cards but over 
themselves." 

protectioa 
only over 
the games 

"Of course. If they don't buy 
Their Charity's cards, they must not 
play his games. Hard to stop, since 
anybody can fake up a deck of 
cards, paint them on blank cards. 
But the monopoly should make it 
illegal." 

"And not just cards like these, but 
any sort of playing cards .. Shucks, 
you could play bridge with cards 
just with numbers on them." 

"Yes." Hu!!h pondered. "Joe. there 
was a Scrabble set in the shelter." 

"It's still around. Ponse's scien-
tists saved everything. Hugh, I see 
what you're driving at. but nobody 
here could learn Scrabble. You have 
to know English." 

"Yes, yes! But what's to keep us 
from inventing Scrabble all over 
again -
in Language? Let me set 
one of my staff to making a fre-
quency count of the alphabet as it 
appears in Language and I'll have · a 
set of Scrabble, board and tiles and 
rules, suited to Language, the fol-
lowing day." 

"What in the name of Uncle is 

Scrabble?" 

IF 

"It's a game, Ponse. Quite a good 
one, too. But the point is that it's 
a game that we can charge more 
for than we can for a deck of 
cards." 

"And that's not all," said Hugh. 

"Parcheesi, 
Monopoly, 
backgam-

mon, Old Maid for kids-- call it 
something else -
dominoes. ana-

grams, poker chips and racks, jig-
saw puzzles- have you seen any?" 

"No." 
"Good for young and old, and all 
degrees of difficulty. Tinker Toy. 
The idea is to think big, this isn't 
just playing cards. Dice. Lots of 
games with dice. Joe, are there ca-
sinos here?" 

"Of sorts. There are places to 
gamble and lots of private gam-
bling." 

"Roulette wheels?" 
"I don't believe so." 
"Tt gets too big to think about. 

Ponse, you are going to have to sit 
up all night every night, just count-
ing your money." 

"Servants for such chores. I wish 
I knew what you two are talking 
about. May one ask?" 

"Sorry. sir. Joe and I were talk-

ing about ancient games ... and not 
just games but all sorts of recrea-
tions that we used to have and have 
now been lost. At least T think they 
have been. Joe?" 

"The only one I've seen that still 
looks familiar is chess. It's practi-
callv the same." 

"Chess would hold up if anything 
would. Ponce~ the point is that ev-
ery one of these things has money 
in it. Surely, you have games now. 
But these will be novelties. So old 
they are new again. Ping Pong .• ~

seen-" 

"No." 
"Billiards. Pocket pool. I'll stop, 

we've got a backlog for a century. 
Ponse, the first problem is to get 1 
protection from Their Mercy to 
cover it all -
and I see a theory 
that makes it all an inspiration f.}om 
on high. It was a miracle." 

"What? Garbage. I don't believe 
in miracles." 

"You don't have to believe in it 
Look, we were found on the Propri-
etor's own personal land- and you 
found us. Doesn't that look as if Un-
cle intended for the Proprietor to 
know about this? And for you as 
Lord Protector to protect it?" 

Ponse 
grinned. 
"An argument 
could be made for such a theory. 
Might be expensive. But you can't 
boil water without feeding the fire, 
as my aunt used to say." He stood 
up. "l'm an old man, I'm tired. 
Hugh, let's see that Scrabble game. 
Soon. Joe, we'll find time for you 
to explain to me these other things. 
We excuse you both. All." 
K itten 
was 
long since 
asleep 
when Hugh returned to hil 

quarters 'but she was clutching a 
note: 

Oh, darling, it was so wonderful to 
see you! ! ! I can't wait until Their 
Charity asks us to make up a four for 
bridge again! Isn't he an old dear? 
Even if he was thoughtless at one point. 
He correcte-d his mistake and that's al-
ways the mark of a true gentleman.

Your Own B. 

•• 

Hugh read Barbara's note with 
mixed feelings. He shared Barbara's 
jOy in ·their reunion, limited and 
temporary as it had been, and eager-
lY' looked forward to the next time 
Ponse's pleasure would permit them 
to be together again. As for the rest 
-
Better get her out of here before 

she-acquired a slave mentality! Sure-
ly, Pon&e was a gentleman within 
the accepted meaning of the term. 
He was conscientious about his re-
sponsibilities, generous, and tolerant 
with his inferior. A gentleman. 

But he was a revolving son of a 
bitch, too! And Barbara ought not 
to be so ready to overlook the fact. 
Ignore it, yes. One had to. But not 
forget it. 
He must get her free. 
But how? 
He went to bed. But not to sleep. 
An aching hour later he got up, 
went into his living room, moving 
softly so as not to disturb Kitteri, 
stood at his own window. He could 
barely make out against the black 
sky the blacker blackness of the 

Rocky Mountains, punching jagged 
hales in the sky. 

Somewhere out there, there were 

free men. 
He could 
break his 
window, 
walk toward the mountains, be lost 
in 'them before daylight. Find free 
companions. 
He need 
not even 
break the window -just slip past a 
nodding watchman, or use the au-
thority symbolized by his whip and 
go out at night despite the watch. 
No real effort was made to keep 
house servants locked up. A watch 
was set at nightfall more to keep in-
truders out. Most house servants 
would no more think of running 
away than a dog would. 

Dogs -
One of the studmaster's 

duties was keeper of the hounds. 
If necessary, he could kill a dog 
with his bare hands. But how do 
you run when burdened down with 
two small babies? 
He went to a cupboard, poured 
himself a stiff drink of Happiness, 
gulped it down and went back to 
bed. Soon he slept.
