Michael Witmore

Director, Folger Shakespeare Library

It is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their
composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems
have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to
make them their own.

Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process
of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings
in language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,
new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a
mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds.
These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource
for study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic
texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The
Folger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a
trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.

The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis
for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their
origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the
single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An
unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and
artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been
consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions
also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of
Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.

I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul
Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s
works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a
richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers
who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow
the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the
Folger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and
digital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I
commend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.

From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare

Library

Until now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly
Folger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of
Shakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the
Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of
the plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that
there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But
Shakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or
plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some
cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published
versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great
collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First
Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of
Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others.
Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then
amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other
versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate
text.

Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an
unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the
period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that
made it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred
years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on
cultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,
for example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda
to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The
Tempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not
take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare
editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her
father, Prospero.

The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long
before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to
make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The
Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger
Shakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly
transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,
which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger
Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial
interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from
Othello: “ If she in chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square
brackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood  and sword and
fire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from

Textual Introduction

By Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine

Hamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier.  Who hath relieved/you?”). At
any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for
more information.

Because the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with
twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger
here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,
and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the
plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study
and enjoyment of Shakespeare.

Antony and Cleopatra tells the story of a romance between two
powerful lovers: Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt, and Mark Antony,
who rules the Roman Empire with Octavius Caesar and Lepidus.

Although he is needed in Rome, Antony lingers in Egypt with
Cleopatra. He finally returns to Rome when Pompey, another
military leader, tries to gain control of the empire. Once in Rome,
Antony marries Caesar’s sister Octavia.

After Pompey is defeated, Caesar imprisons Lepidus and turns on
Antony. Octavia attempts to reconcile them, but fails. Antony returns
to Cleopatra. He challenges Caesar at sea, adding Cleopatra’s ships
to his own. When she and her navy flee in mid-battle, Antony
follows, abandoning his men.

Antony fails in a second battle at sea. At first, he blames Cleopatra
and plans to kill her. He responds to false news of her death,
however, by attempting suicide; fatally wounded, he reunites with
her as he dies. Faced with Caesar’s plans to humiliate her in Rome,
Cleopatra kills herself with poisonous snakes.

  News, my good lord, from Rome.

  Grates me, the sum.

  Nay, hear them, Antony.

 Fulvia perchance is angry. Or who knows
 If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
 His powerful mandate to you: “Do this, or this;
 Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that.
 Perform ’t, or else we damn thee.”

  
 How, my love?

  Perchance? Nay, and most like.

 You must not stay here longer; your dismission
 Is come from Caesar. Therefore hear it, Antony.
 Where’s Fulvia’s process? Caesar’s, I would say—

 both?

 Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt’s queen,
 Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
 Is Caesar’s homager; else so thy cheek pays shame
 When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!

  
 Excellent falsehood!

 Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her?
 I’ll seem the fool I am not. Antony
 Will be himself.

 But stirred by Cleopatra.

 Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,
 Let’s not confound the time with conference harsh.
 There’s not a minute of our lives should stretch
 Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?

  
 Fie, wrangling queen,

 Whom everything becomes—to chide, to laugh,
 To weep; whose  every passion fully strives
 To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
 No messenger but thine, and all alone
 Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note
 The qualities of people. Come, my queen,
 Last night you did desire it.  To the Messenger.

 Speak not to us.

  
 I am full sorry

 That he approves the common liar who
 Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
 Of better deeds tomorrow. Rest you happy!

  Amen, dear goddess, hear that prayer of the

 man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to
 behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore, dear

 My idleness doth hatch.—How now, Enobarbus!

  What’s your pleasure, sir?

  Why then we kill all our women. We see

 how mortal an unkindness is to them. If they suffer
 our departure, death’s the word.

  I must be gone.

  Under a compelling occasion, let women

 die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing,
 though between them and a great cause, they
 should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching
 but the least noise of this, dies instantly. I have seen
 her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do
 think there is mettle in death which commits some
 loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in
 dying.

  She is cunning past man’s thought.

  Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of

 nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot
 call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are
 greater storms and tempests than almanacs can
 report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she
 makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.

  Would I had never seen her!

  O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful

 piece of work, which not to have been blest
 withal would have discredited your travel.

  Fulvia is dead.

  Sir?

 The strong necessity of time commands
 Our services awhile, but my full heart
 Remains in use with you. Our Italy
 Shines o’er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius
 Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
 Equality of two domestic powers
 Breed scrupulous faction; the hated grown to

 strength

 Are newly grown to love; the condemned Pompey,
 Rich in his father’s honor, creeps apace
 Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
 Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
 And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
 By any desperate change. My more particular,
 And that which most with you should safe my going,
 Is Fulvia’s death.

  She’s dead, my queen. 

 Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
 The garboils she awaked; at the last, best,
 See when and where she died.

  
 O, most false love!

 Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
 With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
 In Fulvia’s death, how mine received shall be.

 Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
 Goes to and back, lackeying  the varying tide
 To rot itself with motion.

Enter a Second Messenger.

  Caesar, I bring thee word

 Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
 Makes the sea serve them, which they ear and

 With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
 They make in Italy—the borders maritime
 Lack blood to think on ’t—and flush youth revolt.
 No vessel can peep forth but ’tis as soon
 Taken as seen, for Pompey’s name strikes more
 Than could his war resisted.

  
 Antony,

 Leave thy lascivious wassails.  When thou once
 Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st
 Hirsius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
 Did famine follow, whom thou fought’st against,
 Though daintily brought up, with patience more
 Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink
 The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
 Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did

 deign

 The roughest berry on the rudest hedge.
 Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,
 The barks of trees thou browsèd. On the Alps
 It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
 Which some did die to look on. And all this—

 To front this present time.

 O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
 Do bravely, horse, for wot’st thou whom thou

 The demi-Atlas of this Earth, the arm
 And burgonet of men. He’s speaking now,
 Or murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?”
 For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
 With most delicious poison. Think on me
 That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black,
 And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
 When thou wast here above the ground, I was
 A morsel for a monarch. And great Pompey
 Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
 There would he anchor his aspect, and die
 With looking on his life.

 he,

 “Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
 This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
 To mend the petty present, I will piece
 Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
 Say thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded
 And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
 Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke
 Was beastly dumbed  by him.

  What, was he sad, or merry?

 That make their looks by his; he was not merry,

 Says it will come to th’ full. Mark Antony
 In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
 No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where
 He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,
 Of both is flattered; but he neither loves,
 Nor either cares for him.

 Most meet

 That first we come to words, and therefore have we
 Our written purposes before us sent,
 Which if thou hast considered, let us know
 If ’twill tie up thy discontented sword
 And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
 That else must perish here.

  
 To you all three,

 The senators alone of this great world,
 Chief factors for the gods: I do not know
 Wherefore my father should revengers want,
 Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,
 Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
 There saw you laboring for him. What was ’t
 That moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what
 Made the  all-honored, honest, Roman Brutus,
 With the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous

 freedom,

 To drench the Capitol, but that they would
 Have one man but a man? And that is  it
 Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
 The angered ocean foams, with which I meant
 To scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful Rome
 Cast on my noble father.

  
 Take your time.

  
 At land indeed

 Thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house;
 But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
 Remain in ’t as thou mayst.

  
 Be pleased to tell us—

 For this is from the present—how you take
 The offers we have sent you.

 Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must

 To part with unhacked edges and bear back

 That’s our offer.

 I came before you here a man prepared
 To take this offer. But Mark Antony
 Put me to some impatience.—Though I lose
 The praise of it by telling, you must know
 When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
 Your mother came to Sicily and did find
 Her welcome friendly.

 And am well studied for a liberal thanks,
 Which I do owe you.

  You’ve said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony

  Caesar’s sister is called Octavia.

  True, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

  But she is now the wife of Marcus

 Antonius.

  Pray you, sir?

  ’Tis true.

  Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.

  If I were bound to divine of this unity, I

 would not prophesy so.

  I think the policy of that purpose made more in

 the marriage than the love of the parties.

  I think so, too. But you shall find the band

 that seems to tie their friendship together will be
 the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy,
 cold, and still conversation.

  Who would not have his wife so?

  Not he that himself is not so, which is

 Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again.
 Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in
 Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the
 strength of their amity shall prove the immediate
 author of their variance. Antony will use his affection
 where it is. He married but his occasion here.

  And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?

 I have a health for you.

 The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,
 Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
 Put garlands on thy head.

  
 O, Silius, Silius,

 I have done enough. A lower place, note well,
 May make too great an act. For learn this, Silius:
 Better to leave undone than by our deed
 Acquire too high a fame when him we serve ’s away.
 Caesar and Antony have ever won
 More in their officer than person. Sossius,
 One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
 For quick accumulation of renown,
 Which he achieved by th’ minute, lost his favor.

 The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
 Is often left unloved. We should have met you
 By sea and land, supplying every stage
 With an augmented greeting.

  
 Good my lord,

 To come thus was I not constrained, but did it
 On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
 Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
 My grievèd ear withal, whereon I begged
 His pardon for return.

  
 Which soon he granted,

 Being an abstract ’tween his lust and him.

  
 I have eyes upon him,

 And his affairs come to me on the wind.
 Where is he now?

  My lord, in Athens.
 

 No, my most wrongèd sister. Cleopatra
 Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
 Up to a whore, who now are levying
 The kings o’ th’ Earth for war. He hath assembled
 Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus
 Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King
 Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
 King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
 Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, King
 Of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas,
 The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
 With a more larger list of scepters.

  Ay me, most wretched,

 That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
 That does afflict each other!

  
 Welcome hither.

 O’er your content these strong necessities,
 But let determined things to destiny
 Hold unbewailed their way. Welcome to Rome,
 Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
 Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
 To do you justice, makes his ministers
 Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
 And ever welcome to us.

  
 Welcome, lady.

  Welcome, dear madam.

 Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
 Only th’ adulterous Antony, most large
 In his abominations, turns you off
 And gives his potent regiment to a trull
 That noises it against us.

 To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
 Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
 Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued

 To hear from me you had left Antony
 And put yourself under his shroud,
 The universal landlord.

 Say to great Caesar this in deputation:
 I kiss his conqu’ring hand. Tell him I am prompt
 To lay my crown at ’s feet, and there to kneel.
 Tell him, from his all-obeying breath I hear
 The doom of Egypt.

 Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry,
 And at this time most easy ’tis to do ’t,
 When my good stars that were my former guides
 Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
 Into th’ abysm of hell. If he mislike

 Which writ his honor in the acts it did
 Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
 Splitted the heart. This is his sword.
 I robbed his wound of it. Behold it stained
 With his most noble blood.

  
 Look you sad, friends?

 The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
 To wash the eyes of kings.

  
 And strange it is

 That nature must compel us to lament
 Our most persisted deeds.

  
 His taints and honors

 Waged equal with him.

  
 A rarer spirit never

 Did steer humanity, but you gods will give us
 Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touched.

  
 O Antony,

 I have followed thee to this, but we do lance
 Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce
 Have shown to thee such a declining day
 Or look on thine. We could not stall together
 In the whole world. But yet let me lament
 With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts

 Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but
 I do not greatly care to be deceived
 That have no use for trusting. If your master
 Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him
 That majesty, to keep decorum, must
 No less beg than a kingdom. If he please
 To give me conquered Egypt for my son,
 He gives me so much of mine own as I
 Will kneel to him with thanks.

  
 Be of good cheer.

 You’re fall’n into a princely hand; fear nothing.
 Make your full reference freely to my lord,
 Who is so full of grace that it flows over
 On all that need. Let me report to him
 Your sweet dependency, and you shall find
 A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
 Where he for grace is kneeled to.

  
 Pray you tell him

 I am his fortune’s vassal and I send him
 The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
 A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
 Look him i’ th’ face.

  
 This I’ll report, dear lady.

 Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
 Of him that caused it.

 As answering to the weight. Would I might never

 By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites

 Though written in our flesh, we shall remember

 I cannot project mine own cause so well
 To make it clear, but do confess I have
 Been laden with like frailties which before
 Have often shamed our sex.

 We will extenuate rather than enforce.
 If you apply yourself to our intents,
 Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
 A benefit in this change; but if you seek
 To lay on me a cruelty by taking
 Antony’s course, you shall bereave yourself
 Of my good purposes, and put your children
 To that destruction which I’ll guard them from
 If thereon you rely. I’ll take my leave.

 How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours,
 And should we shift estates, yours would be mine.

 Even make me wild.—O slave, of no more trust

 Go back, I warrant thee! But I’ll catch thine eyes

 That I some lady trifles have reserved,
 Immoment toys, things of such dignity
 As we greet modern friends withal, and say
 Some nobler token I have kept apart
 For Livia and Octavia, to induce
 Their mediation, must I be unfolded
 With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me
 Beneath the fall I have.  To Seleucus.  Prithee, go

 hence,

 Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
 Through th’ ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,
 Thou wouldst have mercy on me.

  
 Forbear, Seleucus.

  
 Cleopatra,

 Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged
 Put we i’ th’ roll of conquest. Still be ’t yours!
 Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe
 Caesar’s no merchant to make prize with you
 Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be

 cheered.

 Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear

 queen,

 For we intend so to dispose you as
 Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.
 Our care and pity is so much upon you
 That we remain your friend. And so adieu.

 Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there
 That kills and pains not?

 the party that should desire you to touch him, for
 his biting is immortal. Those that do die of it do
 seldom or never recover.

  Remember’st thou any that have died on ’t?

  Very many, men and women too. I

 heard of one of them no longer than yesterday—a
 very honest woman, but something given to lie, as a
 woman should not do but in the way of honesty—
 how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt.
 Truly, she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm.
 But he that will believe all that they say shall never
 be saved by half that they do. But this is most
 falliable, the worm’s an odd worm.

  Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.

  Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you,

 for it is not worth the feeding.

  Will it eat me?

  You must not think I am so simple but

 I know the devil himself will not eat a woman. I
 know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil
 dress her not. But truly these same whoreson devils
 do the gods great harm in their women, for in every
 ten that they make, the devils mar five.

  Well, get thee gone. Farewell.

Enter Iras bearing Cleopatra’s royal regalia.

 Yare, yare, good Iras, quick. Methinks I hear
 Antony call. I see him rouse himself
 To praise my noble act. I hear him mock
 The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
 To excuse their after wrath.—Husband, I come!
 Now to that name my courage prove my title.

 I give to baser life.—So, have you done?

 This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake.
 I found her trimming up the diadem
 On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,
 And on the sudden dropped.

  
 O, noble weakness!

 If they had swallowed poison, ’twould appear
 By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
 As she would catch another Antony
 In her strong toil of grace.

  
 Here on her breast

 There is a vent of blood, and something blown.
 The like is on her arm.

 Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,
