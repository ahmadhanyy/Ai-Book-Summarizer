THE NEW CAMBRIDGE SHAKESPEARE

GENERAL EDITOR: Brian Gibbons, University of Munster
ASSOCIATE GENERAL EDITOR: A. R. Braunmuller, University of California, Los Angeles

From the publication of the first volumes in 1984 the General Editor of the New Cambridge
Shakespeare was Philip Brockbank and the Associate General Editors were Brian Gibbons
and Robin Hood. From 1990 to 1994 the General Editor was Brian Gibbons and the
Associate General Editors were A. R. Braunmuller and Robin Hood.

MACBETH

This is the most extensively annotated edition of Macbeth currently available, offering a thor-
ough reconsideration of one of Shakespeare's most popular plays.
A full and accessible introduction studies the immediate theatrical and political contexts of
Macbeth's composition, especially the Gunpowder Plot and the contemporary account of an
early performance at the Globe. It treats such celebrated issues as whether the Witches compel
Macbeth to murder; whether Lady Macbeth is herself in some sense a witch; whether Banquo
is Macbeth's accomplice in crime; and what criticism is levelled against Macduff. A well-
illustrated account of the play in performance examines several cinematic versions, such as those
by Kurosawa and Roman Polanski, and other dramatic adaptations.
Several possible new sources are suggested, and the presence of Thomas Middleton's writing
in the play is proposed. Appendixes contain additional text and accompanying music.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

'If I have done well, and as fitting the story, it is that which I desired: but if slenderly
and meanly, it is that which I could attain unto.'1 Most of what I say about Macbeth
must already have been said in the voluminous writings about the play, and anyone
who reads Thomas Wheeler's excellent 'Macbeth': An Annotated Bibliography, 1990,
will understand how little there is that has not been said about this compelling play. I
acknowledge debts I recall and apologise for failing to acknowledge those I do not.
A children's rhyme assures us that big fleas have little fleas to bite 'em; editors have
editors, and even associate general editors have a general editor. For me, the editor's
editor is Brian Gibbons, and his light touch and gentle bite made me always wish for
the most succinct and clearest phrase, note, and collation. Paul Chipchase, Sue Gib-
bons, Judith Harte, and Sarah Stanton did more to improve this effort than they will
ever say, or I will ever know.
Now I essay the impossible task of parsing my further indebtedness. Those credi-
tors include R. A. Foakes, whose edition of A Midsummer Night's Dream helped me
shape the Introduction here, students in the courses named English 247 and 142c (at
the University of California, Los Angeles), and my research assistants - several of
whom were supported by my university's Center for Medieval and Renaissance Stud-
ies under the direction of, first, Michael J. B. Allen and, latterly, Patrick Geary, and
others of whom were supported, just as generously, by the Research Committee of my
university's Academic Senate, who also supported my own work - (chronologically, as
memory serves) Kari Schoening, Owen Staley, Margaret Sullivan, Jerome Arkenberg,
Karl Hagen, and Billy Phelan, who helped over several years. These individuals'
compulsiveness, argumentativeness, and learning often equalled my own, and I thank
them, as I also thank the institution, UCLA, that supported them and me.
Michael Cohen, David Stuart Rodes, and I worked long and valuably on an elec-
tronic, multi-media version of Macbeth, now published as a CD-Rom ('The Voyager
Macbeth\ 1994), and I learned much from our joint venture. A fragment of Michael
Cohen's effort appears here in Appendix 1; David Rodes's beneficent influence has
pervaded not just this edition and our electronic version, but all my university service.
Our joint effort also allowed me to be instructed (but not convinced) by Lisa Harrow.
Many colleagues at UCLA - Charles A. Berst, Robert W. Dent, Claire McEachern,
Donka Minkova, Alan Roper, Norman J. W. Thrower, Robert N. Watson - taught me
things (from maps to philology, Shaw to annotation to Davenant) I needed to know
and did not. The Sheriffs Department of Los Angeles County retrieved my stolen
automobile and the edition it contained with remarkable dispatch, and I thank those
public servants.

To heap one Pelion on another and also to repeat, I should say I am especially
grateful to Thomas L. Berger, Pauline Croft, Brian Gibbons, Victoria Hay ne, Gail
Kern Paster, Linda Levy Peck, Billy Phelan, G. R. Proudfoot, Sarah Stanton. And,
again, my work has been generously assisted by the following organisations: the
Research Committee, Academic Senate, University of California, Los Angeles; the
National Endowment for the Humanities; the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washing-
ton, D.C.
All were generous, and, even more important, all were patient.

ABBREVIATIONS AND CONVENTIONS

i. Shakespeare's plays

Shakespeare's plays, when cited in this edition, are abbreviated in a style slightly modified from
that used in the Harvard Concordance to Shakespeare. Other editions of Shakespeare are abbre-
viated under the editor's surname (Furness, Hudson) unless they are the work of more than one
editor. In such cases, an abbreviated series title is used (Cam., Oxford). When more than one
edition by the same editor is cited, later editions are discriminated with a raised figure
(Theobald2). All quotations from Shakespeare, except those from Macbeth, use the lineation of
The Riverside Shakespeare, under the general editorship of G. Blakemore Evans.

INTRODUCTION 

Violent in action and memorably written, difficult to perform and yet extraordinarily 
popular on stage, granted by actors and audiences its own special 'curse',' William 
Shakespeare's Macbeth strongly resists critical and theatrical exposition. Despite these 
manifest contradictions, an early-twentieth-century critic asserts that the play 'is 
distinguished by its simplicity . . . Its plot is quite plain. It has very little intermixture 
of humour. It has little pathos except of the sternest kind. The style [of the play's 
language] . . . has not much variety . . .'2 Like many speeches in Macbeth, each of these 
apparently straightforward claims is paradoxical: each is true and at the same time 
misleading. Further, these claims are both true and false to the play's life in the 
theatres of early Jacobean London and in the theatres of many times and many places 
since. Moreover, these claims are often false to the play's complex relation with the 
social and political circumstances in which it was first written and first performed. As 
I understand my introductory task, it is to give an account of a magnificent early-
seventeenth-century English play as it was originally conceived and as it might have 
been first played in a faraway and impossible-to-retrieve moment or series of moments 
in Jacobean London. It is also my task to present its afterlife in times and places very 
distant from the historical William Shakespeare, from his extraordinary acting com-
pany, and from their once living, now irretrievably lost, social, commercial, political, 
theatrical world. 

To that end, I consider here: the play in its Jacobean, early-seventeenth-century 
moments - especially its possible political meanings - and its likely relation to docu-
mentary sources; the play's treatment of time and of time's varied evocations (family, 
succession, birth and death); the many ways in which the play allows or withholds 
knowledge and belief for the characters and the audience; the ways the play affects the 
audience through language; the ways the play has been performed in early and later 
times and in other places and media. 

1 See Iona Opie and Moira Tatem (eds.), A Dictionary of Superstitions, 1989, p. 396, and Richard Huggett, 
The Curse of Macbeth' and Other Theatrical Superstitions, 1981. The nature of the play's 'curse' (which 
derives at least partly from its representation of the demonic and, practically, from its many sword-fights 
and the consequent physical danger to the actors) and the remedies for that curse, especially for quoting 
it outside the theatre, are elaborate. My favourite version is that of the distinguished actor Patrick Stewart, 
who taught me this remedy when I made the mistake of quoting one of the sisters' lines in the play: to 
remove the curse of quoting Macbeth outside the theatre, one must immediately speak an equal number 
of lines from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Other recorded remedies include walking 
around the theatre building three times.

derided Bradley's version of Macbeth, but the issues he identified - history, identity, violence, sover-
eignty, for example - have not gone away. See, among many, Francis Barker, The Culture of Violence: 
Tragedy and History, 1993, pp. 51-92; Sheldon P. Zitner, 'Macbeth and the moral scale of tragedy', 
Journal of General Education 16 (1964), 20-8; and Robert B. Heilman, 'The criminal as tragic hero: 
dramatic methods' (1966), rpt. in Kenneth Muir and Philip Edwards (eds.), Aspects of'Macbeth \ 1977, pp. 
26-38. 

Macbeth 
M 

Macbeth in legend, Macbeth in history 

James Stewart or Stuart (i 566-1625), the sixth king of that name to rule Scotland, 
believed, or claimed to believe, that he descended from one Banquo, Thane of 
Lochaber in the eleventh century when Scotland's king was Macbeth (see illustration 
1). In late March 1603, the same King James VI became the first of that name to rule 
England. Barely two years later, Samuel Calvert commented on political drama, public 
response to it, and official failure to react: 

The Plays [i.e. the players?] do not forbear to present upon their Stage the whole Course of this 
present Time, not sparing either King, State or Religion, in so great Absurdity, and with such 
Liberty, that any would be afraid to hear them.1 

Calvert assumes that audiences would be 'afraid' to hear or see plays representing a 
living monarch, secrets of state, and controversial religious matters ('King, State or 
Religion'), and that such plays should be treated specially and usually censored. 
Samuel Calvert was probably right, or at least conventional for his time. Queen 
Elizabeth I's first proclamation seeking to control the subject and content of drama (16 
May 1559) used words that were regularly repeated and echoed in official and unoffi-
cial documents: 'her majestie doth . . . charge [her officers] . . . that they permyt none 
[i.e. no 'common Interludes'] to be played wherin either matters of religion or of the 
governaunce of the estate of the common weale shalbe handled or treated . . .', and 
thirty years later the Privy Council sought closer theatrical control because the com-
panies had 'handle[d] in their plaies certen matters of Divinytie and of State unfitt to 
be suffred'.2 To offer the public a play representing living monarchs almost always 
drew official attention and usually censorship. Less than eighteen months after 
James's accession, his newly patented London acting company, the King's Men, twice 
performed a now-lost play, 'the tragédie of Gowrie'. The Tragedy of Gowrie presum-
ably dealt with the alleged attempt by the Earl of Gowrie and others to assassinate 
James on 5 August 1600, when he was still King of Scotland only.3 The Tragedy of 

1 Samuel Calvert to Ralph Win wood, 28 March 1605, in Winwood, Memorials of Affairs of State, 3 vols., 
1725,11, 54. Calvert may refer specifically to the controversy Eastward Ho caused; see p. 12 below. The 
Comte de Beaumont, the French ambassador, an observer admittedly grinding a diplomatic and political 
axe, vividly noted: 'what must be the state and condition of a prince [King James], whom the preachers 
publicly from the pulpit assail, whom the comedians of the metropolis bring upon the stage, whose wife 
attends these representations in order to enjoy the laugh against her husband' (letter, 14 June 1604, quoted 
from E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 vols., 1923,1, 325), and Henry Crosse, a fairly temperate 
critic of the theatre, complains that 'there is no passion wherewith the king, the soveraigne majestie of the 
Realme was possest, but is amplified, and openly sported with, and made a May-game to all the beholders, 
abusing the state royall' (Vertves Commonwealth (1603), sig. P3). 
2 Quoted from Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, iv, 263 and 306, respectively. Matters of religion and state 
were the most frequently censored dramatic subjects throughout the Tudor and Stuart period. 
3 See W. F. Arbuckle, 'The "Gowrie Conspiracy'" [in two parts], SHR 36 (1957), 1-24 and 89-110. 
Scottish public opinion immediately doubted official claims about the events (Arbuckle, pp. 13-14), and 
an Edinburgh pamphlet, Gowries Conspiracie (1600), supporting James's version, appeared less than a 
month later, soon enough for George Nicolson, the English agent in Scotland, to send a copy south on 3 
September (Arbuckle, p. 18). Valentine Simmes's London edition of this text, The earle of Gowries 
conspiracie, was entered in the Stationers' Register on 11 September 1600 and published, possibly soon 
after, with the date '1600'. Such speedy printing and reprinting may indicate a propaganda war and/or 
contemporary anxieties about attacks on monarchs.

Gowrie was quickly suppressed,1 and its fate suggests how politically and practically 
difficult it was to write and perform plays concerning the Stuart monarchy and its 
well-known vicissitudes in Scotland and in England. Many years later, the British 
monarchy, now Hanoverian, faced an effort to restore the Stuarts, and after the Battle 
of Falkirk (1746), when Scottish troops, supported by the French, won a temporary 
advantage, 'The king was advised to go to the theatre and to command the tragedy of 
Macbeth', and the play was performed.2 In the anxious times of a largely Scottish 
insurrection against the British (or English) central government in 1746, Macbeth was 
considered a pro-English, pro-monarchical, anti-rebel, and (curiously) anti-Stuart 
play. 
Given even this brief context, it is a nice understatement to say that 'Shakespeare's 
task in writing Macbeth was . . . extremely problematic.'3 From a very different per-
spective, another critic agrees: ''Macbeth is a play about Scotland, seized at a crucial 
moment of transition in its history . . .'4 However distant these early-seventeenth-
century debates and problems may seem, they were living difficulties for the King's 
Men, for William Shakespeare as playwright, and for their audiences at the Globe 
theatre and elsewhere. Those difficulties entailed not only who might have rightfully 
ruled Scotland in the eleventh century, but who might justly rule Scotland and, more 
controversially, England, in the seventeenth. 
Looking back to early Jacobean London, we recognise that these early-seventeenth-
century debates affect our understanding of Macbeth\ origins. Reversing the telescope 
of time, we must suppose that those debates shaped the play's creation. The problems 
of situating the composition and earliest performances of Macbeth, and of determining 
its sources in written documents, contemporary events, and early Jacobean culture, are 
interdependent matters, often with no certain answers. One place to start is with the 
often-remarked 'connection' between the play and the accession of the Scottish King 
James VI as England's King James I, whose family provided England's and Scotland's 
native monarchs until the death of Queen Anne in 1714. Arguments linking Macbeth 
with King James or with specific events in the early seventeenth century divide into 
the 'topical' Macbeth and the 'occasional' Macbeth. First, the play may be studied as a 
'topical' or general repository of references to events, ideas, or persons in the years 
immediately after James's accession,5 second, as a more specific response to the un-
precedented 'occasion' of a Scottish king becoming England's king, third, as a re-
sponse to an even more precise 'occasion', when James's brother-in-law, the Danish 
King Christian IV, first visited England. 

1 For these performances and their suppression, see John Chamberlain to Ralph Winwood, letter, 18 
December 1604, in N. E. McClure (éd.), The Letters of John Chamberlain, 2 vols., 1939, 1, 199.

4 John Turner, 'Macbeth', in Graham Holderness et al. (eds.), Shakespeare: The Play of History, 1988, p. 
120. Just before this remark, Turner says: 'two rival Scottish traditions of interpreting relations with 
England, the unionist and the nationalist. . . have been brought together . . . in Macbeth . . . to 
problematise our understanding of historical progress by the theatrical experience of tragedy'.

Murder Under Trust: The Topical Macbeth', 1981.

Introduction 

TOPICAL 
MACBETH 
Claims for a topical Macbeth cannot be substantiated and may be circular. There are 
some striking pieces of what may be 'evidence'. Consider the Porter in Macbeth: 

Here's a farmer that hanged himself on th'expectation of plenty. Come in time - have napkins 
enough about you, here you'll sweat for't. (Knock) Knock, knock. Who's there in th'other devil's 
name? Faith, here's an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who 
committed treason enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in, 
equivocator. 
(2.3.3-10)' 

Critics have linked the Porter's words with the notorious imprisonment, trial, and 
execution (1606) of the Gunpowder plotters, who had sought to blow up Parliament, 
along with the king and his family, and many aristocrats and judges on 5 November 
1605. Among those executed was the Superior of the English Jesuits, Father Henry 
Garnet, who espoused the doctrine of'equivocation' ('here's an equivocator that could 
swear in both the scales . . .') and used the alias 'Farmer' ('Here's a farmer that hanged 
himself.. .').2 

Among other topical evidence, there is Matthew Gwinne's brief Latin pageant, 
'Très Sibyllae' (Three Sibyls), welcoming King James to St John's College, Oxford, 
on 27 August 1605, apparently drawing upon chronicle accounts of Macbeth and 
Banquo meeting the three witches, and pandering to James's belief that he was 
descended from Banquo.3 Gwinne's pageant, recited by 'très quasi Sibyllae' (three 
persons like sibyls), is quite conventional. Although the repeated uses of'Salve' (Hail) 
in addressing king, queen, and royal prince seem close to the witches' words in 
Macbeth Act 1, Scene 3, they do in fact duplicate a sibyl's prophetic greeting that 
Queen Elizabeth had heard thirty years earlier, when one 'Sibylla' intercepted her as 
she rode through the Earl of Leicester's park at Kenilworth Castle with the words, 'All 
hayle, all hayle, thrice happy prince, / I am Sibilla she / Of future chaunce, and after 
happ, / foreshewing what shalbe.'4 Gwinne's seemingly significant language may 
'prove' only that he could read Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles (see pp. 13-15 below) 
as well as any other author eager to please the new king.5 Most of the proposed links

Macbeth's history in Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles (1587) and anticipates Simon Forman's eyewitness 
account of a Jacobean performance of Macbeth. See pp. 13-15 and 57-8 below. 

Macbeth 
[6] 

between Macbeth, the Gunpowder Plot, and Gwinne's pageant prove to be vague, 
circumstantial, or undatable.1 

If Macbeth contains allusions to the Gunpowder Plot, some of its text must have 
been composed after 5 November 1605; if the play alludes to the conspirators' trials, 
convictions, and executions, some of its text must have been composed about the first 
quarter of 1606. If the First Witch's mention of a sailor who is 'master o'th'Tiger' 
(1.3.6) refers to one specific historical ship, as her eerily precise reference to that 
historical ship's tumultuous voyage might suggest, then her lines could not have been 
written before that particular Tiger returned to England (27 June 1606) and the ship's 
travails became known.2 If William Warner's additions to Albions England, published 
at an unknown date in 1606 (see p. 10 below), echo, rather than anticipate, Macbeth, 
the play must have been publicly performed or its subject-matter and perhaps its text 
have become publicly known before Warner composed his text. 
Verbal similarities between Macbeth and Antony and Cleopatra suggest that the two 
plays may have been written at about the same time. Macbeth, awaiting the murderers, 
compares himself and Banquo with Mark Antony and Octavian (Shakespeare's 
Octavius), the man who became Augustus Caesar, the first Roman emperor: 

There is none but he [Banquo], 
Whose being I do fear; and under him 
My genius is rebuked, as it is said 
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. 
(3-i-55~8) 

Yet these verbal similarities say nothing certain about priority or proximity of compo-
sition.3 Macbeth, although its general style is very different, has many linguistic and 
imaginative links with Shakespeare's The Rape of Lucrèce, published in 1593, many 
years before Macbeth seems to have been written and performed.4 Around the same 
supposed time of Macbeth'*s original composition, Volumnia in Coriolanus powerfully 
compares mother's milk and blood, two of Macbeth''s most evocative liquids: 

The breasts of Hecuba, 
When she did suckle Hector, looked not lovelier 
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood 
At Grecian sword, contemning - 
(Coriolanus 1.3.40-3) 

1 See J. Leeds Barroll, Politics, Plague, and Shakespeare's Theater, 1991, pp. 133-52. 
2 See i-3.6n. It is impossible to know how widespread the knowledge of the Tiger's voyage might have 
been. 
3 Antony and Cleopatra and Macbeth are also dramaturgically similar; see p. 24 below and p. 28 n. 1. The 
plays also have similar 'arming scenes' (Macbeth 5.3 and Antony 4.4), where love, or memories of love, 
interrupt preparations for war. More generally, the Shakespearean tragedies that probably preceded and 
succeeded Macbeth - King Lear and Antony and Cleopatra, respectively - follow what may be a psycho-
logically or authorially explicable treatment of time. In King Lear, time is memorably expressed as ageing, 
or the coming-into-being of a past; in Antony and Cleopatra, time is treated as a present past, as nostalgia 
(see e.g. Michael Neill (éd.), Ant., 1994, pp. 94-8); in Macbeth, time is treated as a future-in-the-present 
(see 1.5.54-6 and pp. 20-3 below) or as the future made a changeless present.

Imperial Theme, 1931, 3rd edn, corr. rpt., 1954, p. 133, and Kenneth Muir (éd.), Mac, 9th edn, 1962,

Introduction 

These lines are part of Volumnia's reply to Virgilia's anxious worry - 'O Jupiter, no 
blood!' - for her husband's safe return from war. They also rewrite in Shakespearean 
'Roman' terms Lady Macbeth's willingness to dash out the brains of the child she 
suckled (1.7.54-9; s e e P- 36 below). Blood for milk, in Shakespeare's Rome and 
Shakespeare's Scotland.1 The plot of Coriolanus also puts ambiguous 'heroes', 
Coriolanus and Aufidius, into conflict, as does the plot of Macbeth: Macbeth versus 
Banquo, who acknowledges 'cursed thoughts' (2.1.8) which might be thoughts of 
usurpation; later, Macbeth versus Macduff, who disastrously abandons his family and 
becomes at least technically a regicide; still later, Macbeth versus Malcolm, who also 
flees and whose royal claim rests on Duncan's nomination (1.4.37-9) and remains at 
best arguable.2 By joining an attractive hero-villain with ambiguously moral or am-
biguously 'good' opponents, Macbeth resembles Richard HI among Shakespeare's 
earlier plays.3 

Further, Shakespeare's Roman plays and English history plays emphasise shame as 
a motive for royal and aristocratic acts. Macduff cannily manoeuvres Macbeth, who 
supposes himself invincible ('I bear a charmed life which must not yield' (5.8.12)), into 
battle by threatening public humiliation: 

Then yield thee coward, 
And live to be the show and gaze o'th'time. 
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, 
Painted upon a pole and underwrit, 
'Here may you see the tyrant.' 
(5.8.23-7) 

Social and political humiliation and near-raucous comedy are closely joined here, as 
they are in Antony and Cleopatra (see p. 28 below); earlier in Macbeth (Act 2, Scene 3), 
the Porter insistently if unself-consciously combines 'high' political events with 'low' 
bodily functions. Before choosing suicide, Cleopatra imagines public humiliation were 
she to submit to Roman power {Antony and Cleopatra 4.12.33-9, 5.2.108-24); Richard 
III uses his physical deformity as ambition's spur {Richard III 1.1.14-51); and 
Aufidius cleverly names Coriolanus a 'boy of tears' {Coriolanus 5.6.100) when the 
political, deadly moment is right. 
Although traditional chronologies place Macbeth after King Lear and before Antony 
and Cleopatra and Coriolanus, those chronologies are uncertain.4 Amidst these uncer-

1 R. B. Parker (éd.), Cor., 1994, p. 52, compares Volumnia's behaviour in general and Lady Macbeth's 
'"unsexing" herself (with a comparable distortion of breast-feeding to child-murder) . . .' Dying, Cleo-
patra links death and suckling when she compares the fatal asp to a child: 'Dost thou not see my baby at 
my breast, / That sucks the nurse asleep?' {Ant. 5.2.309-10). 
2 Critical suspicion of Banquo begins with Bradley, pp. 304 and 306-8; for the play's ambivalent treatment 
of Macduff and Malcolm, see pp. 88-93 below. 
3 Emrys Jones, Scenic Form in Shakespeare, 1971, pp. 199-224, discusses Macbeth's structural (and some 
verbal) links with Shakespeare's earlier plays, especially Richard III and (more surprisingly) Henry VI, 
Parts 2 and j . For Richard IIFs relation with Macbeth, see also p. 71 below and n. 3. 
4 For the traditional argument, see E. K. Chambers, William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems, 
2 vols., 1930,1, 249-50 and 271, and for Macbeth, ibid., I, 471-6, but Chambers admits (1, 251) that Lear, 
Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra come 'in no certain order'. A counter-claim appears in Barroll, passim, 
but esp. chapters 5-6. Barroll speculates that Macbeth was written 'by the end of 1606' (p. 177) and may 
have been first performed 'at court, December-February 1606-7' (P- 153); Barroll's argument for both 

Macbeth 
m 

tainties, there is one highly probable claim. When Scotland's King James became 
England's King James in March 1603, his accession made a Shakespearean Scottish 
play commercially viable and creatively attractive. King James and his Scottishness 
created an occasion, and at some point Shakespeare and the King's Men apparently 
seized the popular, commercial moment, as they had less successfully done in per-
forming The Tragedy ofGowrie. 

OCCASIONAL 
MACBETH 
Macbeth has been called an 'occasional' play in two senses: first, the argument runs, 
Shakespeare would not have composed a play on a Scottish subject had not a Scottish 
king come to the English throne. This claim seems very probable. Second and more 
specific, some scholars believe Shakespeare composed the play as a 'compliment' to 
King James, perhaps even as an entertainment when King Christian IV of Denmark, 
James's brother-in-law, visited his fellow monarch from 17 July to 11 August 1606.1 

James's interest in witchcraft and the King's Evil (compare 4.3.141-61),2 and his belief 
that he was descended from Banquo, have been claimed, plausibly, as links between 
the new king and Shakespeare's play, but the more specific claim that Macbeth was 
written to honour the Danish king's visit, or that the play was performed before James 
and Christian - who did not speak English3 - lacks any proof. The royal visit included 
many dramatic performances - three unnamed plays by the King's Men, another by 
the company that had recently been punished for anti-Scottish satire in Eastward Ho, 
another by the Children of Paul's - as well as bear-baitings and demonstrations of 
fencing and wrestling.4 Yet John Heminge of Shakespeare's company received the 
customary £10 per play,5 and the records mention no extraordinary costs, as we might 
have expected if Macbeth had been performed, since in a full-blown royal performance 
it would probably have required some unusual costumes, props, and machinery. 
Unlike masques and other courtly entertainments, few public theatre plays (such as 
Macbeth) were premiered at court and/or written for a specific royal occasion. In 1606, 

composition and performance partly depends upon the frequent theatre-closures for the plague (see p. 9 
below, n. 1), and it is weakened by the unargued assumption (pp. 17 and 19) that in the Jacobean period 
Shakespeare did not continue to write plays when London performances were forbidden. Equally uncer-
tain is Macbeth's chronological relation with Pericles (1609), a play deeply interested in birth, death, and 
parenthood.

Introduction 

plague had closed the theatres for many months. Economic necessity, therefore, as 
well as the commercial value of performing at court, might have led the King's Men 
to present Macbeth there first.1 

Nothing stronger than hypothesis and circumstantial evidence joins Macbeth with 
either James's accession or Christian's visit, yet no English tragedy (as opposed to 
comedies and histories) on Scottish subjects earlier than Macbeth has survived. Four 
Scottish tragedies are known to have been written; they are for us only titles: 'a 
Tragédie of the Kinge of Scottes' (1567-8), 'Robart the second Kinge of scottes 
tragédie' or 'the scottes tragedi' (September 1599), 'malcolm Kynge of scottes' (April 
1602), and 'the tragédie of Gowrie' (already mentioned).2 A satiric remark in Will 
Kemp's Nine Daies Wonder (1600) implies that Macbeth and what Kemp calls 'Proph-
etesses' (possibly the beings who later became the 'sisters' of Macbeth) had already 
appeared in a ballad.3 Kemp had been the principal comic actor in the Lord Chamber-
lain's Men (the earlier name of the King's Men), and he might therefore have known 
a now-lost Macbeth-play.4 

Before Macbeth, English dramatists and their audiences generally understood 
Scotsmen as a comical, alien, dangerous, and uncivilised people - as Frenchmen who 
spoke a form of English, perhaps.5 The historic Franco-Scottish alliance, the 'auld 

1 Among likely plays and entertainments, George Peek's Arraignment of Paris requires Queen Elizabeth as 
a participant and was advertised as having been performed at court; one version of Ben Jonson's Every 
Man Out of His Humour ends with an address to Elizabeth and was apparently performed at court, perhaps 
before it appeared at the Globe. Jonson's Sejanus may also have been performed first at court; see Philip 
Ayres (éd.), Sejanus, 1990, p. 9, citing E. K. Chambers. A few other plays may have been designed for 
royal performance before appearing in public theatres: see e.g. Glynne Wickham, ''The Two Noble Kinsmen 
or A Midsummer Night's Dream, Part 77?', in G. R. Hibbard (éd.), Elizabethan Theatre VII, 1980, pp. 167-
96. Generally, however, plays were performed publicly and then performed (sometimes adapted) at court. 
For the effort and expenses required by dramatic productions at court, see Glynne Wickham, Early 
English Stages, 3 vols., 11, pt. 1 (1963), chap. 8. For a different view about Macbeth, see Barroll, p. 153; he 
notes (p. 144): 'Beginning in June 1606, there would be no public presentations of plays in London for 
seven or eight months' because of the plague 'and thus no performances of Macbeth at the Globe'; such 
a long closure might make original performance at court more likely. Parker (éd.), Coriolanus, pp. 86-7, 
argues that Coriolanus may have been written and rehearsed, perhaps before paying audiences, under 
similarly difficult conditions. If Parker's guess is accurate, both writing and rehearsal of Coriolanus 
contradict BarrolPs assumptions about Macbeth (see p. 7 above, n. 4).

''The Scot's Tragedy and the politics of popular drama', ELR 23 (1993), 428-49; on the third, see 
Henslowe, pp. 199-200. 
3 Bullough, vu, 429. 
4 David Wiles, Shakespeare's Clown: Actor and Text in the Elizabethan Playhouse, 1987, p. 34. Dover Wilson 
(NS, pp. xli-xlii) thought a Macbeth-play existed in Elizabeth's reign, and G. B. Evans (private commu-
nication, 30 May 1994) has noted many verbal similarities between F Macbeth and A Warning for Faire 
Women (printed 1599), a Lord Chamberlain's Men's play. 
5 Typically, Scots and Scotland were material for comedies (such as Robert Greene's James IV, which 
includes an English invasion to rectify Scottish royal abuses, or the anonymous Pinner of Wakefield), or for 
history plays concerning the long medieval wars against Scotland (e.g. Peek's Edward I, Marlowe's 
Edward II, and the anonymous Edward III, in which Shakespeare probably had a hand and which 
includes a 'treacherous' Scottish invasion of northern England, repulsed by Edward III in person and 
involving the capture of David, King of Scots), or for national stereotypes and comic effects, as in Henry 
V and the quarto versions (1600, 1619) of Portia's ridiculed suitors in The Merchant of Venice. In the last 
instance, the Folio discreetly changes a satiric reference to a 'Scottish lord' to 'other lord'; perhaps 
similarly, Shakespeare transferred the Hero-Claudio plot in Much Ado from the Scottish setting of his 
source (Ariosto) to Italy (see Bullough, 11, 62). Edward III in particular, and very unlike Macbeth, draws 

Macbeth 
[10] 

alliance', made these two countries seem especially likely to take advantage of any 
English internal dissension: 'If Lincolnshire seke to distroye Englande, what wonder 
is hit if Fraunce and Scotlande sometime have fought [i.e. sought?] to offende me?', 
one English propagandist wrote.1 And the possibly Shakespearean Edward III (? 1593) 
dramatises an earlier period, the fourteenth century, when English ambitions in 
France coincided with the designs of the Scots (England's 'everlasting foe'2) and the 
French on England. In Edward III, David, King of Scots, promises the French 
ambassador, 'That we with England will not enter parley, / . . . nor take truce' 
{Edward III 
1.2.22-3). The text of Henry V alludes to this episode, where 
Westmoreland succinctly gives the English view: 

But there's a saying, very old and true, 
1If that you will France win 
Then with Scotland first begin.'' 
For once the eagle England being in prey, 
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot 
Comes sneaking, and so sucks her princely eggs, 
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat 
To 'tame and havoc more than she can eat.3 

Unmentioned in Henry V are England's frequent attacks upon and invasions of 
Scotland. Queen Elizabeth engaged in very f@w independent foreign military adven-
tures, but her first (1560) was against Scotland, when she intervened in Scottish 
factional struggles, hoping to install a puppet-régime or even to conquer the country.4 

Lamenting Queen Elizabeth's death and praising King James as the first monarch to 
unite cBritaine\ William Warner's A Continuance ofAlbions England (1606) adds to a 
work first published in 1586 and often republished and enlarged; Warner's 1606 
additions include a chapter (94) 'Of Makbeth the Tyrant. . .', perhaps alluding to 
Shakespeare's Macbeth, another (95) on the Gunpowder Plot, and one (90) 'Of the 
long continued League and Confedracie betweene the French and Scots against the 
English . . .'s Although Andrew Boorde practised medicine in Glasgow, his Fyrst Boke 
of the Introduction of Knowledge (?i547) is a compendium of the stereotypes that 
English popular and political writing kept alive for Shakespeare's audience: 

I Am a Scotyshe man, and trew I am to Fraunce; 
In every countrey, myselfe I do avaunce; 
I wyll boost myselfe, I wyll crake and face; 

attention to Scottish speech, using such conventional stage-Scots as 'whinyards' (thought to be an 
especially Scottish weapon; see Supplementary Note 4.3.162, p. 244 below), 'Jemmy' (for 'Jimmy'), and 
'bonny' (see Giorgio Melchiori (éd.), Edward III (forthcoming), 1.2.33 and 57, respectively; subsequent 
quotations cite this edition). Later, King Edward specifically compliments the Countess of Salisbury for 
her ability to imitate King David's speech: ' "Even thus", quoth she, "he spake" - and then spoke broad, 
/ With epithets and accents of the Scot, / But somewhat better than the Scot could speak' (2.1.29-31).

Introduction 

I love to be exalted, here and in every place.

Wherfore I offend them, and my lorde above . . . 
I am a Scotyshe man, and have dissymbled muche, 
and in my promyse I have not kept touche. 
Great morder and theft in tymes past I have used ..." 

We cannot completely reimagine sixteenth- or early-seventeenth-century English 
attitudes toward Scotland and its people, or even contemporary English knowledge of 
them, but surviving documents tell an ominous tale. 
English fear and prejudice had deep roots. Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles (see pp. 
13-15 below) begin with William Harrison's 'Description of Britaine' where chapter 4 
comments on the Scots: 

How and when the Scots, a people mixed of the Scithian and Spanish blood, should arrive here 
out of Ireland, & when the Picts should come unto us out of Sarmatia, or from further toward 
the north & the Scithian Hyperboreans, as yet it is uncerteine . . . the Scots did often adventure 
hither [i.e. into the British Isles] to rob and steale out of Ireland, and were finallie called by them 
Meats or Picts (as the Romans named them, because they painted their bodies) to helpe them 
against the Britains, after the which they so planted themselves in these parts, that unto our time 
that portion of the land cannot be cleansed of them. I find also that as these Scots were reputed 
for the most Scithian-like and barbarous nation, and longest without letters . . . For both 
Diodorus lib. 6. and Strabo lib. 4. doo seeme to speake of a parcell of the Irish nation that should 
inhabit Britaine in their time, which were given to the eating of mans flesh, and therefore called 
Anthropophagi... it appeareth that those Irish, of whom Strabo and Diodorus doo speake, are 
none other than those Scots of whom Jerome speaketh Adversus jfovinianum, lib. 2 who used to 
feed on the buttocks of boies and womens paps, as delicate dishes.2 

Cannibalistic, violent, unlettered - these are qualities English audiences associated 
with the Celts whom their supposed ancestors and Roman armies had forced to the 
margins of the British Isles; similar fear and prejudice appear elsewhere in plays and 
other documents, public and private.3 For instance, Henry Percy, Earl of Northum-
berland, wrote to James VI about Anglo-Scottish hostility shortly before his accession 
as England's king: 'the name of scotts is harche in the earres of the wulgar . . . [but] the 
memoriss of the ancient woundis betuene england and Scotland will soune be cancelled 
when conscience in there harts sail proclame your ryght'.4 James I himself and his

135-6. 
2 Raphael Holinshed et al., The First. . . Volumes of Chronicles, 1587, pp. 5b-6a. The claim that the pe
of Ireland and Scotland were related seems historically correct: migration and invasion from the Conti-
nent forced peoples from the north of Britain across the Irish Sea, and close connections (both friendly 
and unfriendly) between Ireland and Scotland persisted into Jacobean times.

History, 1990, pp. 170-5. 
4 John Bruce (éd.), Correspondence of King James VI. of Scotland, Camden Society 78 (1861), 56. Both the 
English and the Lowland Scots considered Highlanders, denizens of the parts of Scotland where Macbeth 
is imagined to take place, especially savage and uncivilised: see John Major (Mair), A History of Greater 
Britain, ed. and trans. Archibald Constable, 1892, pp. 48-9. For early modern perceptions of the 
Highlander, see T. C. Smout, A History of the Scottish People 1560-1830, 1969, pp. 42-6. 

Macbeth 
[12] 

royal predecessors and successors found Highlanders a difficult, recalcitrant, inde-
pendent people.1 

James was enthusiastically welcomed on his accession, not least because he had a 
male heir, but the king and his Scottish entourage quickly became objects of courtly 
envy and theatrical derision,2 as they did, for instance, in Eastward Ho by George 
Chapman, Ben Jonson, and John Marston. Chapman and Jonson went to prison and 
Marston into hiding for various offences including a passage where one of their 
slightly criminal characters described life in the new Virginian colony as free of the 
usual impediments to larceny except for the criminal competition of 

a few industrious Scots, perhaps, who, indeed, are dispersed over the face of the whole earth. 
But as for them, there are no greater friends to Englishmen and England, when they are out on't, 
in the world, than they are. And for my part, I would a hundred thousand of 'em were there 
[Virginia], for we are all one countrymen now, ye know; and we should find ten times more 
comfort of them there than we do here [in London] . . .3 

In short, better 100,000 Scots in Virginia than any Scot in London. 
Shakespeare's audiences probably had a crude and garish image of Highlanders, but 
English readers might have known a more generous view of the Scots as fighting men. 
Before the Battle of Pinkie (or Musselburgh), an English writer noted: 

Thoughe they [Scottish warriors] me[a]nt but small humanit[i]e, yet shewed thei. . . much 
civilit[i]e, both of fayre play ... & of formall order to chyde [the English force] ear [ere] they 
fought.4 

In the 1550s, an English listing of national stereotypes ambivalently named 'the Scots 
for boldness', but several decades later William Camden recalled the Scottish alliance 
with France and less ambiguously notes: 

with manlike courage and warlike prowesse, they [the Scots] have . . . maintained [their king-
dom] at home, [and] . . . also hath purchased great honour abroad. For the French cannot but 

1 In Basilikon Doron (1598), James VI, who five years later became James I of England, repeated Mair's 
views (see preceding note) when he cautioned his infant son, Prince Henry, about the Highlands and 
advised him on how he should deal sternly with the Highlanders when he became king; see C. H. 
Mcllwain (éd.), The Political Works of James I, 1918, p. 22. Basilikon Doron was reprinted in London 
(1603), along with many other of James's writings, when he ascended the English throne. For James's 
Highland policy, see Maurice Lee, Great Britain's Solomon, 1990, pp. 196-203, and for the availability of 
Basilikon Doron in the theatrical community, see p. 15 below, n. 1. Prince Henry died young, in November 
1612. Just before the prince's death, Henry Peacham envisaged Highlanders (or 'redshanks') among the 
national enemies that the future king of a united Scotland and England might face: 'whether TURKE, 
SPAINE, FRAUNCE, or ITALIE, / The REDSHANKE, or the IRISH Rebell bold, / Shall rouze thee 
up, thy Trophées may be more, / Than all the HENRIES ever liv'd before' (Henry Peacham, Minerva 
Britanna, 1612, p. 17; I have slightly modernised the spelling).

acknowledge they have seldome atchieved any honourable acts without Scottish hands, who 
therefore are deservedly to participate [share] the glorie with them.1 

Camden's remark may be as much anti-French as pro-Scot, yet his preference is a 
telling one. 
Camden shows an admirable judiciousness, but popular - or at least recorded -
hostility to James and his Scottish entourage spread from court gossip and the theatre, 
where topicality then as now sold places, to the floor of Parliament. In February 1607, 
Sir Christopher Piggott astonished the House of Commons when he interrupted a 
debate on the union of Scotland and England, a union James dearly sought; this 
outburst sent Piggott to the Tower: 

let us not join murderers, thieves, and the roguish Scots with the well-deserving Scots. As much 
difference between them as between a judge and a thief. . . They ['the roguish Scots', presum-
ably] have not suffered above two kings to die in their beds, these 200 years.2 

Piggott only slightly exaggerated the violence of Scottish history and all too accurately 
recalled the political weakness of her kings. That weakness included most recently 
James VI, who had often found himself the announced or virtual captive of various 
aristocratic factions. The violence and the weakness both appear in Macbeth. 

DOCUMENTS 
Although Shakespeare's own writings were one of his main sources - he 'copied from 
himself'3 - the principal printed source for the plot of Macbeth also served as a source 
for Shakespeare's English history plays: the massive Chronicles (first published in 1577 
and later expanded (1587) into the version Shakespeare read) compiled by Raphael 
Holinshed and others. The text of this work is divided into three 'volumes' (though 
published as two separately bound books); the histories of Scotland and Ireland in 
'volume' 11 serve to separate the histories of pre- and post-Conquest England in 
'volumes' 1 and m, respectively. The 'Historié of Scotland' contains two accounts 
Shakespeare unquestionably appropriated, one of the reign and murder of King Duff, 
the other of Macbeth's rise and reign.4

4 Holinshed and his collaborators consulted numerous sources; the main ones for Macbeth's reign seem to 
have been Hector Boece, Scotorum historiae (1526, 1575), and John Bellenden's Scots translation of it 
(?i54o). For other sources of Scottish history available to Holinshed (and therefore possibly to Shake-
speare), see Norbrook, and Supplementary Note 1.3.30, pp. 239-40 below. R. A. Law, 'The composition 
of Macbeth with reference to Holinshed', Texas Studies in English 31 (1952), 35-41, provides tabular 
summaries of where Macbeth parallels and deviates from Holinshed. 

Macbeth 
M 

In the first narrative, the wife of 'Donwald', a hitherto loyal nobleman in whom 
Duff placed 'a speciall trust', urges her husband 'to make . . . awaie' King Duff 'and 
shewed him the meanes wherby he might soonest accomplish it'; 'kindled in wrath by 
the words of his wife',1 Donwald secretly murders the king, smuggles the body out of 
the castle, and buries the corpse in a river bed. During Duncan's 'fained treatie' with 
the invading Sueno, drugged drinks stunned the Danish soldiers, and the army fell 
'into a fast dead sleepe, that in manner it was unpossible to awake them'.2 Similarly, 
Lady Macbeth promises to make Duncan's 'two chamberlains', his most intimate 
guards, 'spongy [drunken] officers' (1.7.63, 71). Holinshed stresses that Duff trusted 
Donwald, that the king had frequent difficulties with witches, and that louring dark-
ness and bizarre events (including equine cannibalism and strange contests between 
birds of unequal ferocity)3 pestered Scotland until Duff's body was found and prop-
erly buried. 
In Holinshed's account, Macbeth's career is influenced by his ambitious spouse: his 
wife 'lay sore upon him to attempt' regicide 'as she that was verie ambitious, burning 
in unquenchable desire to beare the name of a queene'.4 According to Holinshed, 
Banquo is a fully committed co-conspirator; he is murdered after the passage of some 
time because Macbeth fears 'he should be served of the same cup, as he had minstred 
to his predecessor',5 but Banquo's ghost does not interrupt a royal banquet, and Lady 
Macbeth does not walk in her sleep. Holinshed elaborately details Macbeth's ten-year-
long reign as a good and responsible ruler, his trust in witches and wizards, the 
'testing' of Macduff by Malcolm, and the coming of Birnam Wood to Dunsinane, and 
includes many other events and even phrases that were transmuted into Macbeth. At 
one point, Holinshed interrupts his narrative to give a detailed genealogy of 'the 
originall line of those kings, which have descended from . . . Banquho',6 and the list, 
ending with the then King James VI of Scotland, would have made the 'show of kings' 
in Act 4, Scene 1, easier to invent. 
One of the kings who reigned between Duff and Duncan was Kenneth, a good king 
who none the less secretly poisoned Duff's son in order to ensure his own son's 
succession. Conscience, however, 'pricked' Kenneth: 

And (as the fame [rumour, tale] goeth) it chanced that a voice was heard as he was in bed in the 
night time to take his rest, uttering unto him . . . 'Thinke not Kenneth that the wicked slaughter 
of Malcome Duffe by thee contrived, is kept secret from the knowledge of the eternall God: 
thou art he that didst conspire the innocents death . . . even at this present are there in hand 
secret practises to dispatch both thee and thy issue out of the waie . . .' The king with this voice 
being striken into great dread and terror, passed that night without anie sleepe comming in his 
eies.7 

King Kenneth's torment, so similar to Macbeth's imaginings (Act 2, Scene 2), is 
elaborated still further in a volume Shakespeare may have known, and which his

Introduction 

theatrical colleague, the actor Edward Alleyn, possessed, Rerum Scoticarum historia 
(1582). Its author was the distinguished scholar and neo-Latin dramatist George 
Buchanan, who tutored the young King James.1 For at least one incident - the death 
of Siward's son and his father's reaction to it - Shakespeare could have consulted two 
known sources: the very end of Holinshed's 'volume' 1, concerning the period just 
before the Norman invasion, and William Camden's Remains Concerning Britain 
(1605).2 

Aside from Holinshed's Chronicles and the dramatist's possibly direct use of 
Holinshed's own sources, such as Hector Boece's Scotorum historiae (1526, 1575) and 
Buchanan's Rerum Scoticarum historia, many other texts may have contributed to the 
language of Macbeth - Seneca's Latin tragedies, for instance, and Samuel Daniel's 
Arcadia Reformed (performed during the royal visit to Oxford in 1605 and published 
as The Queenes Arcadia the next year).3 Yet 'when all is said, Shakespeare's main source 
was Holinshed'.4 'What he [Shakespeare] did not find in Holinshed was any indication 
how to shape this narrative material for the stage',5 and that shaping must be our main 
concern. 

Macbeth in the mind 

SUCCESSION, TIME, AND FAMILIES 
The historical era of Macbeth's reign was as controversial in Scottish political debate 
and historiography as the reigns of John or of Henry IV were in England.6 In both 

1 See Bullough, vu, 509-17, and Norbrook, who seems confident (pp. 87-8) that Shakespeare knew 
Buchanan's history. King James and Buchanan held deeply divergent views of monarchical authority; see 
e.g. Pauline Croft, 'Sir John Doddridge, King James I, and the antiquity of Parliament', Parliaments, 
Estates and Representation 12 (1992), 103. For Edward Alleyn's ownership of Buchanan's Rerum 
Scoticarum historia, see J. R. Piggott, 'Edward Alleyn's books', in Aileen Reed and Robert Maniura (eds.), 
Edward Alleyn: Elizabethan Actor, Jacobean Gentleman, 1994, pp. 63-5. Buchanan's book, printed in 
Edinburgh and later on the Continent but not in London (see I. D. McFarlane, Buchanan, 1981, pp. 512-
14, and John Durkan, Bibliography of George Buchanan, Glasgow University Library Studies, 1994, pp. 
218 ff.), had been recalled for censorship in Scotland and prohibited in England (see McFarlane, pp. 414-
15, 437, and 437 n. 55). The book was, however, well known in the Sidney circle and approvingly 
mentioned in Spenser's A View of the Present State of Ireland (written c. 1598); see James E. Phillips, 
'George Buchanan and the Sidney circle', Huntington Library Quarterly 12 (1947-8), 23-55, esP- PP- 49~ 
55. Given Alleyn's interest, Buchanan's Rerum Scoticarum historia might have been a common theatrical 
source like Holinshed's Chronicles. Alleyn also owned King James's Basilikon Doron and Daemonologie, 
both potentially relevant to Macbeth's composition, and many of James's published speeches. 
2 'The Historié of England' in Holinshed, The First. . . Volumes of Chronicles, p. 192a. A nearby page (p. 
195a) gives an account of King Edward's ability to prophesy and to cure the King's Evil (see Macbeth 
4.3.148-61). Lee Bliss suggested to me that Shakespeare drew this incident from Camden, and it has not 
been noted before; see Camden, p. 216 (sig. 2B2v in the 1605 edn). Camden's Remains are probable sources 
for King Lear (see Bullough, vu, 274, 288, 322) and Coriolanus (see Parker (éd.), Coriolanus, p. 3). 
3 See Bullough and, for other sources and possible influences, Kenneth Muir, The Sources of Shakespeare's 
Plays, 1977, chapter 29. In addition to the possible source mentioned in the previous note, the present 
edition suggests new sources and analogues to the play's language, or elaborates upon earlier suggestions, 
in 2.3.75n., 5-i-64n., and the Supplementary Note to 3.1.91-107, p. 242 below.

countries, the past and its most notably disputed successions fostered, if censorship 
did not intervene, discussion of legitimate sovereignty, tyranny, usurpation, and 
deposition. Entering this simultaneously 'historical' and contemporary debate, 
Macbeth was indeed 'extremely problematic'. 
Holinshed makes clear enough that the Duncan-Macbeth-Malcolm period saw 
Scotland begin to move from its traditional system of royal succession - tanistry - to 
primogeniture, the system which later became common and which was by Shake-
speare's day long-established.1 Under tanistry, a ruler's successor was elected from a 
parallel family line, so that, for example, nephew (and not necessarily eldest nephew) 
succeeded uncle.2 When Duncan nominates (1.4.35-9) his eldest son, Malcolm, as his 
successor, he abruptly introduces a system half-way between tanistry and primogeni-
ture. In this instance, Duncan wishes eldest son to succeed father, excluding any 
younger brothers (e.g. Donaldbain) or cousins, but the very nomination indicates that 
eldest son succeeding father (primogeniture) is not established practice.3 Henry VIII's 
controversial attempts to settle the royal succession made such questions vivid for an 
English audience, as did the recent, much-debated succession of James himself.4 

The system in early Scotland has been described as 'circulation with elimination' 
where 'Tension between incumbent and successor is relieved at the expense of in-
creased conflict between the potential successors themselves',5 as indeed we see in 
Macbeth. 
Primogeniture, tanistry, and Duncan's intermediate proposal all attempt to assure 
a monarchy's and therefore a family's continuity, its triumph over time, but primo-
geniture and Duncan's ad hoc proposal both value father-to-eldest-son successions 
exclusively and thus strongly imply the age-old metaphor of the king as 'father' to his 
subjects {pater patriae), making a complex association linking royal progenitor, royal 
authority, and royal succession. 
Here, experiences and words in which all people share to some degree - parenthood 

Norbrook. All three emphasise how later Scottish and English political developments may have distorted 
the historical accounts on which Shakespeare's own documentary sources drew. Norbrook concentrates 
on sixteenth-century issues, Adam and Goldstein discuss earlier ones. 
1 Primogeniture became settled English law in the 'last years of Henry II' (Frederick Pollock and F. W. 
Maitland, The History of English Law before the Time of Edward I, 2nd edn with new introduction by 
S. F. C. Milsom, 2 vols. (1898; 1968), 11, 274). For tanistry's implications in Scottish historiography 
and Jacobean political thought and debate, see Norbrook, pp. 86-8. Hawkins, 'History, politics and 
Macbeth', in Focus, p. 175, citing an earlier scholarly debate, rightly says 'Shakespeare refers [in the play] 
neither to the law of tanistry nor to Duncan's own unlawful tenure of the throne', but the dialogue's 
silence says nothing about what knowledge shaped the play and nothing about what the audience 
might know of arcane (and therefore interesting?) Scottish practice. 
2 I have simplified tanistry and its possible permutations. For its operation and anthropological functions 
in Ireland, Scotland, and elsewhere, see the Introduction to Jack Goody (éd.), Succession to High Office, 
1966, and J. H. Stevenson, 'The law of the throne - tanistry and the introduction of the law of 
primogeniture', SHR 25 (1927-8), 1-12; for tanistry and primogeniture in sixteenth-century Scottish 
political debate and Shakespeare's and Holinshed's sources, see Norbrook. 
3 On this important point, see Michael Hawkins, 'History, politics and Macbeth', in Focus, p. 175. Hawkins 
goes on, unhappily, to imagine what happens off-stage to produce Macbeth's selection as king after 
Duncan's death, but notes that the unseen, unspoken, events are 'the nearest the play comes to tanistry'.

Introduction 

and birth, adolescence, maturation and death - metaphorically legitimate a particular 
political structure. Shakespeare makes these metaphors, extended to include 'servants' 
as 'children' of the father-king, pervasive in the play. They explain Macbeth's suc-
cinct avowal, 'our duties / Are to your [Duncan's] throne and state, children and 
servants' (1.4.24-5), and his later self-accusing lines on why he should not murder 
Duncan. Duncan's status as kinsman, ruler, and guest all argue 'against the deed': 

First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, 
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, 
Who should against his murderer shut the door, 
Not bear the knife myself. 
(1.7.13-16) 

So also, to take two rather disparate examples, Macbeth agonises over the 'unlineal 
hand' (3.1.64) which will deny his (possibly imaginary)1 son the crown, and his wife 
says she cannot kill King Duncan because he resembles her father (2.2.12-13) - a s t n e 

metaphorical argument of royal authority insists he must. 
The sisters (or 'witches') attack this tight, mystifying association of parents and 
children with rulers and subjects when they predict that one adult male, Macbeth, will 
become king while another adult male, Banquo, will not be king but a begetter of 
kings. What they represent as paradoxical, that Banquo is 'lesser' and 'greater' than 
Macbeth and 'Not so happy, yet much happier' (1.3.63-4), is a paradox only under the 
assumptions of both primogeniture and an unfailing succession of male heirs, genera-
tion upon generation. So construed, Macbeth's kingship - or his hope of it - is itself 
deeply paradoxical, since he is not son to a king, and Banquo's line will reign in 
Scotland only if Macbeth's line, as well as Duncan's, fails or is deposed. Succession 
entails mortality. As Macbeth casually says, 'By Finel's death, I know I am Thane of 
Glamis' (1.3.69): by the death of my (or the) father I (the son) am who I am.2 

The crisis of succession in Macbeth is expressed as a crisis of metaphor. When 
Macbeth first speaks of regicide explicitly rather than figuratively, he treats father-son 
succession, the quasi-primogeniture of Duncan's naming Malcolm Prince of 
Cumberland, as the obstacle: 'that is a step / On which I must fall down, or else 
o'erleap, / For in my way it lies' (1.4.48-50). Duncan the metaphorical father-king 
has created a metaphorical son-successor - has combined fatherhood with political 
succession. If primogeniture and metaphor combined lead Macbeth to contemplate 
regicide, the same union of patrilineal succession and thinking-through-metaphor 
leads him to kill Lady Macduff and her children: 

1 Whether Lord and Lady Macbeth have (or have had) children in the play's fictional world is a long-lasting 
theatrical and critical question, much debated as a practical and thematic issue and much ridiculed as a 
non-existent one. See e.g. Knights, 'How many children had Lady Macbeth', and Marvin Rosenberg, The 
Masks of'Macbeth', 1978, Appendix, 'Lady Macbeth's indispensable child', pp. 671-6, calling for a cradle 
and the sound of a child in 1.5 and the cradle's return in 5.1. This demand has to my knowledge only once 
been even partly met: Bengt Ekerod's 1955 Stockholm production included 'a cradle next to which the 
Lady read her husband's letter [in 1.5]. There was no other sign of the baby . . .' (Ann Fridén, 'Macbeth' 
in the Swedish Theatre 1838-1Q86, 1986, p. 235). 
2 Compare Katharine Eisaman Maus, 'Transfer of title in Love's Labor's Lost: language, individualism, 
gender', in Ivo Kamps (éd.), Shakespeare Left and Right, 1991, pp. 210-11. 

Macbeth 
[18] 

2 
The Witches of 'Macbeth': Henry Fuseli's eighteenth-century interpretation of the sisters in Act i, 
Scene 3 

From this moment, 
The very firstlings of my heart shall be 
The firstlings of my hand. And even now 
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done. 
The castle of Macduff I will surprise; 
Seize upon Fife; give to th'edge o'th'sword 
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls 
That trace him in his line. 
(4.1.145-52) 

While 'firstlings' most plainly conveys 'first things' - here, Macbeth's immediate 
impulses or thoughts - an archaic meaning of 'firstlings' is children, 'firstborn'. 
Macbeth's reflection moves from one meaning to the other, from the sudden joining 
of heart and hand, the unreflective joining of thoughts and acts, to generational 
murder, to giving 'to th'edge o'th'sword' Macduffs 'wife, his babes, and all unfortu-
nate souls / That trace him in his line'. The same metaphorical extensions and 
'arguments' that pertained when he earlier vowed loyalty to Duncan's 'throne and 
state, children and servants' now lead Macbeth to murder Macduffs family and 
retainers. Loyalty and tyranny each follow 'naturally' from the play's controlling 
familial-political metaphors. 
As Macbeth understands the sisters' words, deceptive words 'That palter with us in 
a double sense' (5.8.20), they suggest he will gain the throne through interrupting 
generation, through stopping human continuation in time, though he rarely reflects 

[•g] 
Introduction 

upon the corollary that he himself would or might thus lack a lineal successor. 
Consequently, he first envisages, and then undertakes to create, a world in which acts 
have no consequences, no duration beyond the moment of their enactment, no reach 
in time and beyond time into eternity: 

If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well 
It were done quickly. If th'assassination 
Could trammel up the consequence and catch 
With his surcease, success, that but this blow 
Might be the be-all and the end-all - here, 
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, 
We'd jump the life to come. 
(1.7.1-7) 
For a moment, these hypothetical thoughts dissuade him: 

But in these cases, 
We still have judgement here that we but teach 
Bloody instructions, which being taught, return 
To plague th'inventor. This even-handed justice 
Commends th'ingredience of our poisoned chalice 
To our own lips. 
(1.7.7-12) 

Lady Macbeth soon ridicules (1.7.35 ff.) n e r husband's anxiety about the conse-
quences of his actions and persuades him to 'screw' his 'courage to the sticking-place' 
(1.7.60) because she has already accepted (in Act 1, Scene 5) that regicide is necessarily 
an attack on time's progression and duration. 
'Rapt' by witch-inspired (or witch-encouraged) royal visions, Macbeth writes an 
account of his meeting that similarly inspires his wife.1 He serves her as the witches 
served him, and she responds as he did: 

Thy letters have transported me beyond 
This ignorant present, and I feel now 
The future in the instant. 
(1.5.54-6) 

This extraordinary remark, anachronistically condensing the future into the present, 
hints how time and human experience in time will be compressed and squeezed later 
in the play, so squeezed and compressed that the be-all will be the end-all, and time 
itself a syllable: 

Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow 
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day 
To the last syllable of recorded time . . . 
(5.5.18-20) 

For Macbeth, repeated syllables ('Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow') repre-
sent time's slowing and, at 'the last syllable', time's end. For Lady Macbeth, repeated 
acts - 'It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands; I have 

1 See Barbara Everett, Young Hamlet, 1989, p. 104: 'One of the play's most touching and subtle moments 
is that which brings Lady Macbeth before us for the first time, and she is reading Macbeth's letter: he 
exists for her when he isn't there. He exists too much for her when he isn't there, she plans and thinks 
ahead too much for him, she too much connives, putting her image of Macbeth's future where her 
conscience should be . . .' 

Macbeth 
[20] 

known her continue in this a quarter of an hour' (5.1.24-6) ' - and repeated words -
'Out, damned spot! Out, I say! . . . No more o'that, my lord, no more o'that' (5.1.30, 
37-8) - represent the same collapse of change (and of hope and ambition) into a 
repetition where automatic words and acts eerily imitate life: 

DOCTOR You see her eyes are open. 
GENTLEWOMAN Ay, but their sense are shut. 
(5.1.21-2) 

Many actors and many critics have taken Lady Macbeth's behaviour here as a lightly 
rationalised version of demonic possession; for them, Act 5, Scene 1, is the final result 
of her invocation of the 'spirits / That tend on mortal thoughts' (1.5.38-9). The effect 
of Macbeth's letter upon Lady Macbeth, so similar to the effect upon him of the 
sisters' even more ambiguous words, suggests that he is (or becomes) a witch, just as 
a confusion of ends with means, 'trifles' with 'deepest' consequences, transforms Lady 
Macbeth into a witch in Act 5, Scene 1 (see pp. 33-5 below). 
If, in Macbeth, kings are fathers of son-successors and of children-subjects and if, 
'In Macbeth . . . usurpation is imagined as an attack on the order of time itself,2 it 
follows that the play must consider the impossible possibility of unparented children 
because through procreation, through becoming parents, humanity ordinarily takes its 
revenge on time's passing and on the inevitability of any generation's death and every 
generation's replacement by another generation also destined for death and replace-
ment. If 'the order of time itself is to be attacked, so must the order of procreation 
also become vulnerable and put in question. Macbeth's need to make the moment the 
be-all and end-all, to condense future and hence duration into the instant, means 
human procreation must cease - in fact, cannot exist. Lady Macbeth's ambitious hope 
(1.5.54-6) compresses the future into the instant. Her husband's acts compress past, 
present, and future into one timeless, unchanging moment. Lady Macbeth's hope and 
Macbeth's acts are secular and, for the Christian audience, sacrilegious versions of the 
world's end: 

Awake, awake! 
Ring the alarum bell! Murder and treason! 
Banquo and Donaldbain! Malcolm, awake, 
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit, 
And look on death itself. Up, up, and see 
The great doom's image. Malcolm, Banquo, 
As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites 
To countenance this horror. 
(2.3.67-74)3 

In a moment, Donaldbain asks, 'What is amiss?' (2.3.90), and Macbeth describes the 
familial and the dynastic stalemate his regicide has created: 

1 The Gentlewoman's 'a quarter of an hour' insists upon the ordinary world's time-keeping, a systematic 
regularity destroyed by and denied to the Macbeths, who have adopted and promulgated a very different 
'accustomed action'.

3 The bleeding Captain at 1.2.22 describes how Macbeth 'unseamed' an enemy 'from the nave to 
th'chaps': 'nave' might be either the umbilicus or (as in this image) the crotch. The engraving is from the 
title page of Robert Fludd's Utriusque cosmi historia (1617-19). See G. L. Hersey, Pythagorean Palaces: 
Magic and Architecture in the Italian Renaissance, 1976, p. 99, on the difference between images of man-
in-circle found in editions of Vitruvius, where the umbilicus is the centre of the circle, and man-in-circle-
and-square by Leonardo da Vinci, where the umbilicus is the centre of the circle, but the base of the penis 
is the centre of the square 

Macbeth 
[22] 

You are, and do not know't. 
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood 
Is stopped, the very source of it is stopped. 
(2.3.90-2) 

The sons' bloodline, the royal line, is 'stopped' and does not flow into the future 
through successive sons who become kings. Considering the possibility that Malcolm 
and Donaldbain have themselves killed their father, Ross sees a form of filial cannibal-
ism and equates it with the sons' self-thwarting desire to become king: 'Thriftless 
ambition that will ravin up / Thine own life's means' (2.4.28-9). 
Macduff and his family illustrate what Macbeth's attack on time and procreation 
might mean at the level of the person. Macduff himself fulfils the Second Apparition's 
seemingly impossible condition - 'none of woman born / Shall harm Macbeth' 
(4.1.70-80) - because Macduff was 'Untimely ripped' (5.8.16) from his dead or dying 
mother's womb. Macduff was born not of a 'woman' but of a near corpse.1 Once 
Macduff flees to England, Lady Macduff continues the play's profound linking of 
family and state when she translates political act into familial terms. She describes her 
husband's son, now abandoned by Macduff, as 'Fathered he is, and yet he's fatherless' 
(4.2.27), asserting the paternal paradox (fathered/fatherless) that matches her hus-
band's paradoxical birth (mothered/motherless). Moments later, Macbeth's dy-
nastically inspired murders sweep away mother and son, 'Those precious motives, 
those strong knots of love' (4.3.27), whose abandonment later leads Malcolm to 
suspect Macduff, a man not of woman born. 
These episodes and paradoxes express some of the play's most obsessive interests, 
if not exactly its 'values': the way political and dynastic succession-in-time depends 
upon a cycle (birth, death, birth); the importance of motherhood and fathering, and 
the unanticipated ways (Caesarean birth, 'unlineal' usurpation) each may become 
unpredictable; the echoing statements and restatements among the sisters or witches, 
Lady Macbeth, and Lady Macduff. Lady Macduff, ostensibly the play's single 'good' 
female character, speaks to Ross - albeit anxiously and domestically - much the same 
fatally equivocal language as the sisters offer Banquo and Macbeth in Act 1, Scene 3, 
and Macbeth alone in Act 4, Scene 1. Her human uncertainty here soon reappears 
when Malcolm and Macduff spar, circularly and inconclusively, in Act 4, Scene 3. 
Macduff is as isolated in time as Macbeth. MacdufPs paradoxical birth meets the 
Second Apparition's strange condition for one who might harm Macbeth, and 
Macduff does quell tyranny and restore, violently, Duncan's interrupted (but also 
dubiously legitimate) succession. Yet that same birth and the actions it entails place 
Macduff so far outside traditional genealogical or familial narrative that his wife denies 
him as husband, as father of their son, as, indeed, a wise, a loyal, or even a natural man 

1 Thus, the shade of Posthumus's mother describes his birth as having taken place after her death: 'Lucina 
lent me not her aid, / But took me in my throes, / That from me was Posthumus ript' (Cymbeline 5.4.43-
5); compare the First Gravedigger's ingenuity on when suicide is not suicide (Hamlet 5.1.9-20), and 
Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who was a breech (or 'Agrippan') birth, whose mother 'coulde not bee 
delivered of hym uncutte', according to Thomas More (The History of King Richard HI, ed. Richard S. 
Sylvester, in Complete Works of St Thomas More, 11 (1963), 7 and 167), and who was 'sent before [his] time 
/ Into this breathing world, scarce half made up' (Rj 1.1.20-1).

Introduction 

(see 4.2.1-27, discussed above). Macbeth initially claims a secure, explicable place in 
genealogy and succession: 'By Finel's death, I know I am Thane of Glamis' (1.3.69). 
From this moment forward, however, that security melts away, dissolved by a complex 
acid of ambition, miscalculation, and murder, until - in a strange echo of Macduff-
Macbeth ends outside lineal successions, stripped of family ties, helplessly wading in 
blood, finally treading-in-place without advance or retreat or change. The 'good' 
(2.4.20), but flawed revenger Macduff and the criminal hero mirror each other and 
confound empathy and interpretation. According to Ross, Macbeth's rule melds birth 
and family with tyranny - under him, Scotland 'cannot / Be called our mother, but 
our grave' (4.3.167-8) - but of course Macduff s mother's body is also a place of birth 
and death, a place 'untimely'. Macduff is thus 'untimely' in every possible way. He 
entered life, as his mother left it, in a temporally abnormal way; he enters Macbeth's 
final moments in a time-destroying and fatally time-anticipating way; he installs 
Malcolm as king and thus makes Macbeth's supposed line 'untimely'. 

MASTER OF HIS TIME: 'DOUBLY REDOUBLED STROKES' 
As Macbeth's concern for the 'be-all and end-all' and Macduff s unusual mothered/ 
motherless condition demonstrate, Macbeth is deeply interested in the nature of time 
- time as experienced by the person (our individual progress from life to death), time 
as experienced by the family (an individual person's perpetuation through child-
bearing), time as experienced by the state (the succession of one monarch by another), 
and finally and most largely, time as we experience the play's performance. 
Dismissing his lords and ladies until evening comes and it is time for the banquet 
celebrating and validating his kingship, Macbeth orders: 

Let every man be master of his time 
Till seven at night; to make society 
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself 
Till supper-time alone. 
(3.1.42-5) 

Characteristically and disastrously, he does not acknowledge that 'A man is master of 
his liberty; / Time is their master' (Comedy of Errors 2.1.7-8): time masters human 
beings (we die), but time also masters our disposition of our 'free' time, our liberty, our 
freedom of choice. Also characteristically, Macbeth now keeps and will keep himself 
'alone', as he is now and will be: 'why do you keep alone, / Of sorriest fancies your 
companions making' (3.2.8-9), and 'honour, love, obedience, troops of friends, / I 
must not look to have' (5.3.25-6). 
'Style' in Macbeth has been called 'vehement to violence, compressed to conges-
tion',1 but so also is the play's very ordering as an audience experiences it. Verbal style 
and narrative arrangement are indistinguishable. The play's more technical or drama-
turgical handling of time makes the reader's or spectator's temporal experience unlike 
that in any other Shakespearean tragedy. Macbeth (about 2108 lines long) is the third 
shortest of the plays included in the First Folio; only The Comedy of Errors (approxi-

century literary views of the play's language and plot.

mately 1777 lines) and The Tempest (approximately 2062 lines) are shorter, and Julius 
Caesar (approximately 2477 lines) is the only other tragedy with fewer than 3000 lines. 
Brief as a play, Macbeth also has many brief scenes. Traditional division produces 
scenes which average about 75 lines: 'This multiplicity of scenes must be a deliberate 
dramatic device to give an impression of rapid and bustling action, as in Antony and 
Cleopatra\ where scenes average 'no more than 73 lines'. The 'shortest scenes in 
Macbeth have 12 and 10 lines: Antony and Cleopatra has two scenes of 4 lines only'.1 

How powerfully this brevity and rapidity may affect an audience appears in 
Maurice Morgann's eighteenth-century comment on Shakespeare's practice: 

The Understanding must, in the first place, be subdued; and lo! how the rooted prejudices of the 
child spring up to confound the man! The Weird sisters rise, and order is extinguished. The 
laws of nature give way, and leave nothing in our minds but wildness and horror. No pause is 
allowed us for reflection: . . . daggers, murder, ghosts, and inchantment, shake and possess us 
wholly . . . we, the fools of amazement, are insensible to the shifting of place and the lapse of 
time, and till the curtain drops, never once wake to the truth of things, or recognise the laws of 
existence.2 

Event and image - 'daggers, murder, ghosts, and inchantment' - crowd one another 
and subdue Enlightenment rationality. '[R]ooted prejudices', here associated with the 
pre-rational child, domineer over adult understanding, which recognises 'the laws of 
existence', and make spectators 'the fools of amazement'. 
Since Shakespeare explores humanity-in-time through narratives of royal succes-
sion, birth and death in time, or since Shakespeare dramatises narratives of royal 
succession and thereby explores the paradoxes of humanity-in-time, the way Shake-
speare orders those narratives has special importance, and the ordering of Macbeth 
proves rather strange. George Walton Williams claims that King James's intellectual 
and dynastic interests influenced Shakespeare 'in so commanding a manner as severely 
to strain the coherence of the play'.3 Williams sees two conflicting narratives ('two 
parallel fables') and two conflicting political interests in Macbeth. One narrative is the 
kinging and unkinging of Macbeth; the other narrative is the attack on Banquo's line 
and that line's eventual accession and supposed Jacobean survival through Malcolm's 
successful counter-attack on Macbeth.4 The former narrative places our first view of 
King Macbeth at the play's centre and in the middle of the audience's temporal 
experience, the banquet scene (Act 3, Scene 4); untypically for Shakespeare's drama-
turgy, the regicide occurs quite early in Macbeth (Act 2, Scene 3), a subordinate 
dramatic position rather than in the 'middle' or at the 'end' of the play (as in Julius 
Caesar and Richard II respectively) - both more 'important' locations for Shake-
speare's dramaturgy.5

Introduction 

The second narrative emphasises Malcolm's revenging of Duncan's death, a re-
venging which (according to Holinshed's narrative and James's legendary descent 
from Banquo's son, Fleance) eventually led from Malcolm's kingship to a descendant 
of Fleance becoming the father of King Robert II, 'the first of the Stuart kings',1 and 
therefore to James's ancestor. The new King James I of England, insecure as King of 
Scotland throughout his reign there, could hardly have enjoyed a narrative of elev-
enth-century Scottish king-killing, but he might have welcomed a competing narrative 
of his own supposed ancestry, leading to the 'show of kings', where Banquo's and 
Fleance's and James's line stretches out, as Macbeth fears, 'to th'crack of doom' 
(4.1.116) and culminates in Malcolm's final triumph and thus in James's dynastic 
claims and present rule. Though I doubt that Shakespeare very much tailored Macbeth 
to James's special interests - the play contains too many subversive possibilities for 
that - Williams identifies a central structural problem in Macbeth. There are two 
competing narratives. One subordinates Duncan's death to Macbeth's becoming king; 
the other, contradictorily, elevates (in the apparitions and kingly show of Act 4, Scene 
1) the future greatness of Banquo and therefore of his descendants, the Stuarts.2 

Williams's proposals are literary and historical, readerly and source-influenced. 
Emrys Jones's study of Macbeth stresses theatrical 'rhythms' (the prosodie or musical 
metaphor is at once appropriate and distracting) and finds a 'three-part division' in the 
play: 

Part One ('Duncan') occupies Acts One and Two, Part Two ('Banquo') Act Three, and Part 
Three ('Macduff) Acts Four and Five. The first and second of these three parts are followed by 
a marked pause . . . Act Three forms a fairly short unit in itself... the opening of Act Four has 
an inevitable recapitulatory effect, taking us back to the beginning of the play with its similar 
witchcraft concerns . . .3 

Jones here mixes structural or rhythmical insights with unprovable suggestions about 
intermissions or 'intervals' in Jacobean performances (that is, moments when the play 
ceases and non-dramatic or more everyday events - having a drink, eating an orange 
or some nuts, going to the toilet, hearing a musical interlude - can occur). Neverthe-
less, Jones's insights do identify a tripartite theatrical structure or rhythm that valu-
ably counterpoints Williams's equally persuasive bipartite narrative structure. And the 
play's language seems to endorse both views through its constant counterpoint of 

merely number a spatial and temporal sequence: however artificial ''Macbeth Act 3, Scene 4' is as a 
reference, the text it delimits is still about the 'middle' of a knowledgeable audience's temporal experience 
of the play, just as 'Julius Caesar Act 2, Scene 3' is earlier than the 'middle' of an audience's experience 
of the entire play. Here and elsewhere I assume an audience, presumably Shakespeare's own earliest 
audience, long accustomed to the rhythms of early modern London theatre. 
1 Williams, 'Play', p. 18. 
2 Ibid., p. 19: 'By inserting the legend of Banquho into the middle of the legend of Mackbeth, Shakespeare 
has strained the traditional structure of this sort of play. He has transferred the murder of the king from 
its accustomed position in the middle of the play to a location of secondary significance, and he has 
inserted the murder of Banquo in the king's rightful and central place.' 
3 Jones, Scenic, pp. 195-6; Jones's chapter 7 contributes essentially to the study of Macbeth. Mark Rose, 
Shakespearean Design, 1972, pp. 160-2, claims that the banquet scene (3.4) divides the play into two 
'movements' and 'each movement has its own centerpiece, the murder scene [which Rose, pp. 39-43, 
regards as an undivided 2.1-2.3] coming just in the center of the first and the England scene [4.3] in the 
second' (p. 161). 

Macbeth 
[26] 

doubleness and triplicity. When Macbeth reminds himself that Duncan is his guest in 
'double trust', he cites three, not two, relations of trust: 

He's here in double trust: 
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, 
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, 
Who should against his murderer shut the door, 
Not bear the knife myself. 
( 1.7.12-16) 

And then he immediately says, 'Besides, this Duncan / Hath borne his faculties so 
meek . . .' Having made 'double' into three reasons, he now adds a fourth. 
Multiples - doubles, triples, quadruples - are deeply characteristic of the play's 
language, most famously in the sisters' 'Double, double toil and trouble' (4.1.10), but 
multiplying verbal play with singles and doubles also appears in a highly polite, 
emotionally charged moment when Lady Macbeth turns an excessively arithmetical 
compliment to the man and king she has already prepared to kill: 

All our service, 
In every point twice done and then done double, 
Were poor and single business . . . 
(1.6.15-17) 

'Twoness' - multiples of 'two' (here, 'twice done', 'done double') - appears often in 
Macbeth; James Nosworthy also identifies triadic elements - the three sisters them-
selves, for instance, and their 'Thrice to thine . . .' (1.3.33-4) o r t n e i r three threes in 
'nine times nine' ( 1.3.21) - 'in contexts that are evil, and usually satanic'.1 In an early, 
apparently straightforward narrative moment, we hear a 'report' confounding easy 
mathematics where 'double' becomes 'doubly redoubled' and more: 

If I say sooth, I must report they were 
As cannons over-charged with double cracks; 
So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe. 
(1.2.36-8) 

Are the cannons 'over-charged' twice, or four times, or eight times, or sixteen times 
('double', 'doubly', 'redoubled')? These numberings are faint echoes of the sisters' 
doublings and of the equivocal double meanings of 

these juggling fiends . . . 
That palter with us in a double sense, 
That keep the word of promise to our ear 
And break it to our hope. 
(5.8.10-22) 

Numbers and numbering recur throughout Macbeth. How many times does a bell ring 
for Macbeth or Lady Macbeth, how many kings stretch out before Macbeth in Act 4, 
Scene 1, how many gashes are enough to kill a man, how often will the dead rise up in 
Act 3, Scene 4, and after? Each of these timings and each of these numberings finally 
reduces to a character's (especially Macbeth's) linguistic attempt to make time numer-
able. Were time or timing (an actor's and a dramatic character's special need)

Introduction 

so submissive to number, they might also submit to a human ordering or even to 
human control. Time, however, can be neither numbered nor controlled, as Macbeth 
manifests. 
Like literary critics, theatrical critics have puzzled over the structure of Macbeth 
and its special challenges for actors. Without the language of rhythm or of bipartite or 
tripartite structure, James Agate shouldered the journalist's burden of instant criti-
cism and identified a capital problem: 

I have to admit that for the first time in my experience Macbeth [here, John Gielgud] retained 
his hold upon this play till the end. There is a technical reason for the difficulty, the fact that 
Macbeth is given hardly anything to grip the play with. With the banqueting scene [Act 3, Scene 
4], which is only half-way, the part is almost over. After that we have the apparition scene [Act 
4, Scene 1], in which Macbeth is virtually a spectator. Then comes the murder of Lady Macduff 
[Act 4, Scene 2], the long business about Malcolm, the revelation to Macduff [i.e. Act 4, Scene 
3], and the sleep-walking scene. Macbeth's next appearance is with Seyton, and whether the 
play is to stand or fall depends upon the power of the actor to suggest the ravages of mind, soul, 
and even body endured since we saw him last.1 

From an actor's point of view, Michael Redgrave echoed Agate's worries,2 but critics 
have found Act 5 'a carefully thought out and superbly rhythmical solution to a large 
structural problem'. This 'solution' is 'a ritualistic unfolding: everything is taken in its 
due time', a structure 'which gives this final phase a movement suggestive of pre-
ordained ceremony'.3 The Macbeth here rhythmically and structurally described is 
also a play deeply committed to order, the order of refined dramatic structure and the 
order of political and historically endorsed orthodoxy. 
Most unusually for a Shakespearean tragedy, Macbeth contains little overt comedy 
(principally the Porter in Act 2, Scene 3) and little bawdy (principally the Porter, 
again, and the sisters in Act 1, Scene 3, and in Act 4, Scene 1, where the lines may not 
be Shakespeare's at all).4 The absence of comedy may result from the absence of a sub-
plot. While it is true, and consonant with Renaissance learned theory, that Shake-
speare's tragedies often contain but do not develop stunted or stifled gestures toward 
sub-plots, and while Macbeth is also arguably Shakespeare's most history-play-
like tragedy, his 'true' histories spawn additional plots great and small. Here are no

in Agate, Brief Chronicles, 1943, p. 227. Agate goes on to praise Gielgud's Macbeth in Act 5. To some 
degree, Agate here complains about a fact of early Stuart drama: Antony is absent from the final act of 
Antony and Cleopatra and the Duchess is missing from the last act of Webster's The Duchess of Malfi; 
Coriolanus has relatively few lines in the last act of Coriolanus.

4 On theatrical attempts to introduce comedy, see p. 68 below, and for the original Porter, see Appendix 1, 
p. 264. Very rarely, Macbeth himself is a successful comic. In Adrian Noble's RSC production (with 
Sinead Cusack as Lady Macbeth), a 'Freudian study in childlessness' (Michael Billington, The Guardian, 
27 September 1995), for instance, one critic found Jonathan Pryce (Macbeth) 'a bogeyman, a joker, a card, 
a childless husband who delights in the company of children. In the banquet scene [3.4], flailing his hands 
and shaking his head like a dog coming out of water, he clowns his way out of a real fit into a false one so 
plausibly that though we know the jest will be shattered on the third [sic] appearance of Banquo's ghost, 
the foaming fury of Macbeth's reaction prickles the scalp when it comes' (The Observer, 16 September 
1986). For a general view of this production, see Roger Warren, 'Shakespeare in England, 1986-87', SQ 
38 (1987), 363. 

Macbeth 
[28] 

tavern roisterers (Falstaff, Poins, Bardolph, and their ilk), hardly any common, non-
aristocratic characters, no sybaritic hangers-on, no bastards, few talkative, satirical 
soldiers, no brawlers of whatever social status, no social or cultural outsiders. 
Except for the three sisters, the reporting soldier of Act 1, Scene 2, the Porter 
(briefly), and the Old Man of Act 2, Scene 4 (also briefly), Macbeth largely lacks the 
commonsensical, humorous, salacious, scatological, 'foreign' or non-naturalised voices 
that typically diminish and thereby evaluate the speech, values, and behaviour of high-
status, 'heroic' characters in Shakespeare's other tragedies and histories.1 When 
Macduff threatens to make dead or captured Macbeth 'the show and gaze o'th'time', 
a 'rarer monster . . . / Painted upon a pole' (5.8.24-0),2 he offers a humiliation Cleo-
patra fears (see p. 7 above), but not a 'popular' re-evaluation of Macbeth's deeds. 
Macduff s imagined carnivalesque display diminishes Macbeth without judging and 
therefore without valuing his acts: the victim (Macbeth) is diminished, the audience 
amused but unenlightened. 
'Except for the three sisters'. The sisters - only once named 'witch' (1.3.5) m the 
dialogue, though always Witch and Witches in speech headings and stage directions -
provide the ironic and satiric, the unconventional or demystifying, views otherwise 
almost absent from Macbeth, barring the highly personal, psychological modes of Lady 
Macbeth's somniloquy (Act 5, Scene 1) and her husband's increasingly grim reflec-
tions on what he has done and has to do.3 Terry Eagleton declares 'that positive value 
in Macbeth lies with the three witches' and that 'The witches are the heroines of the 
piece', because they 'expose a reverence for hierarchical social order for what it is' 
and inhabit 'their own sisterly community' on that social order's 'shadowy border-
lands', though he does not explain what 'positive value' or the sisters' status as 
'heroines' might mean.4 These imagined 'sisters', with their communal and anti-
militaristic values, may be contrasted with the comic (or perhaps anxiously dismissive) 
treatment of witches and witchcraft in other early modern English plays and with 
Samuel Johnson's view of the comic, 'ridiculed' witches that prevailed in the 

1 Among Shakespeare's other tragedies, Cleopatra's conversation (Ant. 5.2.242-79) with the countryman-
clown who provides the asp that poisons her most nearly approaches the dramatic effect - high seriousness 
clashing with humdrum concerns laconically expressed - of the Porter's monologue with himself. That 
the Porter's speeches are monologue rather than dialogue, however, forces the audience to join disparate 
verbal and emotional registers and, as so often in Macbeth, denies the audience even minimal guidance 
from the dramatist; see Appendix 1, p. 264 below. In the handling of comic viewpoints that both deflate 
high seriousness and evaluate it, Macbeth and Antony and Cleopatra represent one range of dramaturgical 
choices, Lear (with the Fool) and Coriolanus (with the Citizens and tribunes) another. 
2 On this speech, see 5.8.25-7n.; see also Halio and p. 7 above. 
3 Lady Macbeth's actions have been found a 'sub-plot': 'In Macbeth there is a great deal of focus devoted 
to the actions of the tyrant to the exclusion of any sub-plot activity, but we are concerned also with the 
power of Lady Macbeth in urging on her husband and then with the decline of her influence and its 
consequences as he isolates himself from her' (Anthony Brennan, Onstage and Offstage Worlds in Shake-

Introduction 

eighteenth-century theatre Johnson knew.1 One way of dealing with a real or perceived 
fear of witchcraft is to make witches not fearsome but silly, comic, and ridiculous; the 
eighteenth-century English theatre typically took this course, perhaps unthinkingly, 
perhaps out of the practical need to provide work for the company's comic actors. In 
nineteenth-century productions, the witches eventually achieved both respectful and 
terrific treatment. 

PROSPECT OF BELIEF: WITCHES, WOMEN, AND MEDIATED KNOWLEDGE 
For most audiences of Macbeth, the ideas of witchcraft, more particularly the violent 
and sometimes socially pervasive persecutions of the 'witch' those ideas sponsored 
(and that prevailed in Europe and North America from the fifteenth to the eighteenth 
century), are incomprehensible, repellent, temporally 'foreign' and even alien. And yet 
rural and/or unlettered people and the most intellectually sophisticated European 
élites accepted the existence of witches and witchcraft and proceeded, more often 
legally than illegally, to impose their beliefs, with fatal results. Stuart Clark eloquently 
rebukes the unthinking modern view: 

The idea of witchcraft was not then a bizarre incongruity in an otherwise normal world; like all 
manifestations of misrule it was that world mirrored in reverse, and the practices of the alleged 
witches were no less (and no more) meaningful than those of ordinary men and women.2 

Persecution of the witch and of witchcraft made 'meaningful' the ordinary, seemingly 
natural, daily practice of the great mass of individuals - learned or not, poor or rich, 
influential or powerless, or somewhere among these classifications - who defined 
themselves as not-witch, not practising witchcraft, not politically and socially aberrant 
or, in Clark's terms, not 'inverted'. 
In early modern England, witches and witchcraft were political matters as well as 
personal, familial, and communal ones. Biblical precedent identified witchcraft with 
treason: 'For rebellion is as the sinne of witchcraft' (i Sam. 15.23). Following that 
precedent as well as their own self-interested desire for public order, Tudor and Stuart 
governments sought to regulate and, if possible, extirpate various practices labelled 
'witchcraft' by common folk, local magistrates, the legal apparatus, and learned au-
thorities.3 Ordinary people, scholars, courtiers, and royalty all considered witches or 
other figures associated with a hard-to-define 'magic' or supernatural - 'cunning' or 
'wise' women and men, magicians, sorcerers, etc. - to be sometimes useful, but often 
threatening, to a variety of familial, social, and political structures, assumptions, and 
values.4

passage from William Perkins's Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft comprehensively identifying 
enmity to the state with the witch's acceptance of the devil. Clark, 'Inversion', esp. pp. 117-19, elaborates 
this view.

Macbeth 
[30} 

Historians find it difficult to decide whether the witch-persecutions of the late 
sixteenth century in England and Scotland were driven by popular or élite anxieties 
and purposes, varied as those anxieties and purposes were, and shifting, perhaps 
imponderable, as such designations as 'popular' and 'élite' prove to be.' What seems 
undebatable, however, is that post-Reformation Scottish beliefs about and attitudes 
toward witches, and conceptions of their supposed practices, were quite different from 
English ones, especially during the 1590s, a period when witch-prosecutions increased 
in both Scotland and England and a period that must have influenced Shakespeare and 
the audiences of the first performances of Macbeth. The main difference between 
Scotland and England in these matters 'was not in the content, but in the relative 
significance of diabolism in the two countries and in the relative ferocity of the 
punishments for convicted witches'.2 

English 'witches' were typically old women without familial or communal support; 
their supposed 'crimes' were practical and often economically destructive - causing a 
cow to stop giving milk or some other domestic beast to die, causing butter not to 
churn properly, crops to fail - or highly personal - causing a family member to die 
inexplicably, or a man to become sexually incapable, or a woman to be infertile. 
According to both popular belief and legal claims, accused witches contracted their 
souls to the devil in return for a 'familiar', usually a common animal such as a toad, cat, 
fly, or dog, which assisted her (only rarely 'his') demonic designs. 
In 1590, King James VI visited Denmark to meet and marry King Christian IV's 
daughter, Anna. During that visit James may have learned and certainly debated 
continental European witch-theories, which were much more virulent and lurid than 
contemporary English ones. He apparently took these ideas back to Scotland and there 
introduced them to public circulation.3 These beliefs included not merely the witch's 
contracting her or his soul to the devil, but a demonic 'pact' that involved sexual 
intercourse with Satan ('the witches' Sabbath'), the 'black Mass' and other inverted 
religious practices, and numerous activities such as stealing and eating children, 
exhuming bodies, parodying baptism using cats and other animals, flying through the 
air, and sailing the sea in sieves.4 

How the play's 'sisters' are to be portrayed and understood has proved a continuing 
problem for both producers and readers of Macbeth. Indeed, critics and producers 
have puzzled over precisely why the sisters appear in the play. For much of the play's 
performance history, they have been comic figures, wearing 'blue-checked aprons' and 
'high crowned black hats' even early in the twentieth century, and providing spectacle 

witch-beliefs and practices and details of witch-persecutions. For the more general ambivalence towards 
magical thought and practices, see Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, 1971, passim.

The exhibiting of an enemy's severed head is an ignominious punishment that figures twice in Macbeth: 
see 1.2.23 and 5-9-20 SD. This engraving from J. C. Visscher, Londinium Florentiss[i]ma Britanniae Urbs 
(1616), shows the heads of traitors displayed on London Bridge. A Swiss visitor who saw the bridge counted 
'more than thirty skulls', boiled and tarred for preservation, 'of noble men who had been executed and 
beheaded for treason and other reasons' {Thomas Platter's Travels in England, 1599, trans. Clare Williams, 
1937, P- 155) 

(they gave the performance song, dance, and occasions for ever more elaborate dem-
onstrations of'flying' and other forms of'vanishing').1 Gradually, however, the thea-
tre's witches grew more fearsome and demonic and consequently harder to integrate 
into conceptions of'heroic' behaviour and tragic responsibility. By the mid nineteenth 
century, they had achieved psychological status, at least for critics.2 

1 Kalman A. Burnim, David Gamck, Director, 1961, p. 109. 
2 See William Wetmore Story, cited at p. 71 below. Hazlitt had earlier recognised how important a 'serious' 
treatment of the witches was: 'The Witches . . . are indeed ridiculous on the modern stage, and we doubt 
if the Furies of Aeschylus would be more respected' (William Hazlitt, The Characters of Shakespeare Plays 
(1817), ed. A. W. Pollard, 1903, p. 19). 

Macbeth 
M 

Later critics unfamiliar with the theatre and without, seemingly, much interest in 
theatrical history have also puzzled over the witches. Willard Farnham's learned 
account finds them 'demons of the fairy order . . . fiends in the shape of old women 
who do evil wherever and however they can', though they do not 'resemble human 
witches' (i.e. the supposed 'witches' of Elizabethan and Jacobean prosecutions),1 and 
W. C. Curry, equally learned, imagines - from an arm-chair, not a place in the theatre 
- a stage-spectacle where beings he calls the 'Weird Sisters' (who have 'a dark 
grandeur, and a terror-inspiring aspect') 'surmise with comparative accuracy' 
Macbeth's 'inmost thoughts' 'from observation of facial expression and other bodily 
manifestations'.2 For G. L. Kittredge, 'The Weird Sisters . . . are the Norns of 
Scandinavian mythology. The Norns were goddesses who shaped beforehand the life 
of every man . . . for their office was not to prophesy only, but to determine.'3 

Notoriously, Tyrone Guthrie cut the play's first (Folio) scene from his 1934 Old Vic 
production on the joint grounds that the scene was not by Shakespeare (an improbable 
claim) and that 'by making the three Weird Sisters open the play, one cannot avoid the 
implication that they are a governing influence of the tragedy . . . Surely the grandeur 
of the tragedy lies in the fact that Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are ruined by precisely 
those qualities which make them great. . . All this is undermined by any suggestion 
that the Weird Sisters are in control of events',4 and directors no less than critics5 have 
struggled with the sisters' part in the dramatic architecture as well as in the moral and 
tragic meanings of the play. Are the sisters, for instance, subordinate to other, still 
more powerful, demonic forces? Hecate, who clearly arrives to rebuke them as their 
superior in Act 3, Scene 5, may not have been part of the play's original conception, 
but what of'our masters' (4.1.62), perhaps the Apparitions or perhaps some force or 
forces sending the Apparitions? Glen Byam Shaw (Stratford, 1955) and Peter Hall 
(Stratford, 1967) sternly rejected the sisters and Lady Macbeth as determining forces. 
In Hall's words, 

It has been said that he [Macbeth] wouldn't have done it if he hadn't met the witches; but the 
witches are not the three Fates saying go and do it, they see into the seeds of time, they know 
what can happen and what Macbeth wants to happen, but they certainly don't make him do it.6

possible sources (pp. 79-91) is valuable.

William Shakespeare'. 
5 Farnham, Shakespeare's Tragic Frontier, p. 81: 'The witches . . . never, even by suggestion, bind him 
[Macbeth] to evil-doing . . . they tempt him to commit crimes for which he is to assume full moral 
responsibility . . .'

1967 RSC production; see also Samuel L. Leiter (éd.), Shakespeare Around the Globe, 1986, p. 377. 
Contradicting centuries of stage practice, Hall continues: 'It has also been said that without Lady Macbeth 
he wouldn't have done it; but if you take that view you must endorse a weak vacillating Macbeth with a 
tough virago of a lady booting him from behind. I do not believe that either.' For Byam Shaw's view, see 
p. 82 below.

Introduction 

Spectators of Macbeth will probably agree, however, that 'he wouldn't have done it' 

- Macbeth would not have killed Duncan - without Lady Macbeth's urgent sexual 
taunts and insinuations: 

Was the hope drunk 
Wherein you dressed yourself? Hath it slept since? 
And wakes it now to look so green and pale 
At what it did so freely? From this time, 
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard 
To be the same in thine own act and valour, 
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that 
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, 
And live a coward in thine own esteem, 
Letting I dare not wait upon I would, 
Like the poor cat i'th'adage? . . . 
What beast was't then 
That made you break this enterprise to me? 
When you durst do it, then you were a man. 
And to be more than what you were, you would 
Be so much more the man. 
( Ï ^ S S - 4 5 , 47-51)1 

As motivation, these lines ally Lady Macbeth with the sisters, and early audiences 
might have understood Lady Macbeth as a witch, or as possessed by the devil, long 
before her sleepwalking in Act 5, Scene 1. Her extraordinary invocation of the 'spirits 

/ That tend on mortal thoughts' (1.5.38-9) especially pleads: 

make thick my blood, 
Stop up th'access and passage to remorse 
That no compunctious visitings of nature 
Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between 
Th'effect and it. Come to my woman's breasts 
And take my milk for gall, you murd'ring ministers, 
Wherever in your sightless substances 
You wait on nature's mischief. 
(1.5.41-8) 

Here Lady Macbeth invokes two 'unnatural' conditions: stopping up the circulation 
(or in Jacobean scientific terms, the ebbing and flowing) of blood that makes her more 
compassionate ('compunctious') than a male, and ending her menstruation ('visitings 

of nature'), the shedding of blood that typified a female in contemporary English 
culture and signified her ability to bear children.2 

Pierre Le Loyer's French treatise on fantasy, translated into English and published 
(1605) about the time of Macbeth''s composition, discusses the unusual psychological 
state male doctors supposed a woman underwent when menstruation ceased: 

the blood of their monthly disease [i.e. unease, discomfort] being stopped from his course, 
through the ordinary passages and by the matrix dooth redound and beate backe again by the 
heart. . . Then the same blood, not finding any passage, troubleth the braine in such sorte,

that... it causeth many of them to have idle fancies and fond conceipts, and tormenteth them 
with diverse imaginations of horrible specters, and fearefull sights . . . with which being so 
afflicted, some of them doe seeke to throwe and cast themselves into wells or pittes, and others 
to destroy themselves by hanging, or some such miserable end.1 

Like Le Loyer's normative amenorrheal woman, Lady Macbeth suffers 'diverse im-
aginations of horrible specters, and fearefull sights' in Act 5, Scene 1, and the play's 
most unreliable narrative moment claims that Lady Macbeth destroyed herself 'by 
hanging, or some such miserable end' (Le Loyer): the 'fiend-like queen', Malcolm 
says, 'as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands / Took off her life' (5.9.37-8).2 

This same physical condition, or its absence, also linked women with witches. The 
valiantly sceptical Reginald Scot records medical scholars' claim that amenorrhea, the 
absence of menstruation that might mark menopause, also defines female witches, who 
constitute a sub-category of 'melancholike' persons: 

Now, if the fansie of a melancholike person may be occupied in causes which are both false and 
impossible; why should an old witch be thought free from such fantasies, who (as the learned 
philosophers and physicians saie) upon the stopping of their monethlie melancholike flux or 
issue of bloud, in their age must needs increase therein [i.e. in melancholy], as (through their 
weaknesse both of bodie and braine) the aptest persons to meete with such melancholike 
imaginations: with whome their imaginations remaine, even when their senses are gone.3 

King James, sometimes notably rationalist, recognised and was puzzled by the fact 
modern scholars stress: accused witches were overwhelmingly female and usually 
old/ 
Shakespeare's earliest audiences might thus associate Lady Macbeth's invocation in 
Act 1, Scene 5, with an aberrant desire to be both a fantast (a 'melancholike') and a 
witch, a woman seeking to deny what her culture understood as a woman's defining 
'nature' - her ability to bear children - and a woman seeking to become what estab-
lished doctrine most feared, a renegade or 'wayward' woman, a witch or uncontrolled 
wife.5 

Post-menopausal women - 'some of them beyng a while frutefull, but after 
widowes, and for that suppressed of naturall course [menstruation]' - were also, 
according to the surgeon-anatomist John Banister, supposed to 'have beardes . . .

'Attitudes to menstruation in seventeenth-century England', P&P 91 (1981), 47-73. 
2 Malcolm's 'as 'tis thought' is an extraordinary qualification, marking the narrative's uncertainty and, 
perhaps, Malcolm's politically motivated effort to portray the previous régime as insane or despairing.

to Billy Phelan. For a sapient analysis of Scot's work, especially in comparison with Johan Weyer's De 
Praestigiis Daemonum, see Sydney Anglo, 'Reginald Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft: scepticism and 
sadduceeism', in Damned Art, pp. 106-39. 
4 Daemonologie, pp. 43-4; years later, when James questioned Sir John Harington on the point, Harington 
could only offer a coarse joke (see N. E. McClure (éd.), The Letters and Epigrams of Sir John Harington, 
1930, p. no; letter 35 (.'December 1603)). For contemporary views of post-menopausal women as 
'witches', see G. R. Quaife, Godly Zeal and Furious Rage: The Witch in Early Modern Europe, 1987, p. 163, 
and, more significantly, Ralph A. Houlbrooke, The English Family 1450-1700, 1984, p. 213. 
5 '[T]he play [Macbeth] also offers, in the figure of Lady Macbeth, the drama's most vivid manifestation of 
the witch as a dangerous familiar and her witchcraft as "malice domestic," as an invasion of the household 
and its daily life' (Dolan, p. 226).

Introduction 

being then [as widows and non-menstruating women] bearded, hearie [hairy], and 
chaunged in voyceV The description may only hypothetically suit Lady Macbeth, but 
its most provocative claim - 'bearded, hearie' - concerning women whose 'naturall 
course' has been 'suppressed' anticipates Banquo's view of the sisters: 

You seem to understand me, 
By each at once her choppy finger laying 
Upon her skinny lips; you should be women, 
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret 
That you are so. 
(1.3.41-5) 

According to one popular play, 'the women that / came to us, for disguises must weare 
beardes, / & thats they saie the token of a witch'.2 Melancholy, fantasy, amenorrhea, 
bearded women form what seems a conventional series of cultural assumptions. They 
suggest that Lady Macbeth seeks to become, or is, what her culture considered a 
witch. She has also sought, or been associated with, characteristics traditionally 'male' 
- lack of compunction, a beard, no menstruation. 
Macbeth makes some of these associations clear: 

Bring forth men-children only, 
For thy undaunted mettle should compose 
Nothing but males. 
(1.7.72-4) 

Another Shakespearean character explicitly joins ideas of witchcraft with a woman's 
'unfeminine', 'masculine' behaviour when Leontes angrily derides Paulina as 'A man-
kind witch' (Winter's Tale 2.3.67). Leontes' epithet combines humanity ('mankind') 
with a woman's 'male' ('mankind') aggressiveness and with demonhood ('witch'). 
Closer in time to Lady Macbeth's creation, the characterisation of Volumnia, 
Coriolanus's mother, shows a similarly complex - and arguably for Shakespeare and at 
least the male spectators a similarly disturbing - mixture of stereotypical gender-
types, though the added demonising quality of'witch' does not appear in Coriolanus.* 
Rather surprisingly, given the frequent application of 'witch' to Cleopatra and the 
word's use elsewhere as opprobrium (see 1.3.5 n.), n 0 speaker calls Volumnia 'witch'. 
Indeed, 'witch' does not occur in Coriolanus; there, the only 'witchcraft' is 
Coriolanus's own: 

I do not know what witchcraft's in him [Coriolanus], but 
Your [Aufidius's] soldiers use him as the grace fore meat, 
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end, 
And you [Aufidius] are darkened in this action, sir, 
Even by your own . . . 
(Coriolanus 4.7.2-6) 

John Banister, The Historié of Man, 1578, sig. B2v. Banister is never very original and cites pseudo-
Hippocrates {Epidemics vi) here. On how hair might discriminate masculine from feminine, see Joan

Sweno, the 'Norwegian lord' whose invasion of Scotland fails at the beginning of Macbeth, is remem-
bered in the name 'Sueno's Stone', which is given to this pillar (dating from some time between the ninth 
century and the eleventh) which still stands near Forres in Scotland. See 1.2.58-63 and the Commentary at 
1.2.31-62. This engraving from Vetvsta monvmenta (1747-1835), plate 49, shows the south face of the stone 

For some members of MacbetWs earliest audiences, another of Lady Macbeth's 
claims would have been memorable and unusual, to say the least. Urging Macbeth to 
kill Duncan, she invokes a terrible analogy: 

I have given suck and know 
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me: 
I would, while it was smiling in my face, 
Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums 
And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn 
As you have done to this. 
(1.7.54-9) 

Special terror here depends upon the nursing mother's closeness to, and tenderness 
for, the suckling child. While '[cjontemporary opinion was strongly in favour of a

Introduction 

mother feeding her own child',1 English royal, aristocratic, and 'gentle' women (i.e. 
members of the gentry) did not typically nurse their own children. Instead, they 
employed wet-nurses, lactating (usually lower-class) women who nursed the child.2 

Elizabeth Clinton, dowager Countess of Lincoln, described and attacked the snobbery 
such nursing practices encouraged: 

And this unthankfulnesse [not breast-feeding], and unnaturalnesse is oftner the sinne of the 
Higher, and the richer sort, then of the meaner, and poorer, except some nice and prowd idle 
dames, who will imitate their betters, till they make their poore husbands beggars. And this is 
one hurt which the better ranke doe by their ill example; egge, and imbolden the lower ones to 
follow them to their losse . . ? 

We may suppose that the countess's remarks are deeply influenced by her elevated 
social class and its attendant privileges and contempts, not to mention her regretful 
admission that she did not breast-feed her own eighteen children.* Still and yet, 
Elizabeth Clinton's concern for babies remains, along with her stiletto dissection of 
upward mobility. 
Upper-class English women did not nurse their children, unlike the majority of 
mothers. The presumably wide knowledge of this practice - it marked social distinc-
tion (as Elizabeth Clinton demonstrates) and therefore must have been emphasised 
and publicised - supports Coleridge's independent, critical, unhistoricised comment 
when he disagreed with the then-prevailing view of Lady Macbeth as a monster.5 A 
possibly singular bequest may suggest the culture's general attitude. John Greene, a 
lawyer who eventually became Recorder of London, specified in his will that his 
daughters should have £1000 apiece 'except Margaret who was to have a further £100 
"because her mother nursed her" '.6 Whatever the aristocracy's practice, indeed what-
ever the practice of those lower in the social order, a mother's nurturing attachment to 
her child affected in this single instance how a father bequeathed his wealth. 

In William Harrison's 'Description of Scotland' we read, as Shakespeare almost 
certainly did: 

sith it was [in ancient Scotland] a cause of suspicion of the mothers fidel[i]tie toward hir 
husband, to seeke a strange nurse for hir children (although hir milke failed) each woman would

century England', Continuity and Change 1 (1986), 31. 
2 Regular playgoers would have been reminded of this aristocratic practice: see e.g. Giovanni of his mother, 
Isabella: 'I have often heard her say she gave me suck, / And it should seem by that she dearly loved me, 
/ Since princes seldom do it' (Webster, White Devil 3.2.336-8), and Dekker, Westward Ho 1.2.117-20, for 
the supposed damage suckling did to a woman's beauty. In The White Devil, Richard Burbage, who may 
have been the first Macbeth, acted Ferdinand (see Appendix 1, p. 264 below, and Edwin Nungezer, A 
Dictionary of Actors, 1929). See, generally, Valerie Fildes, Breasts, Bottles and Babies: A History of Infant 
Feeding, 1986.

5 Lady Macbeth's assertion (1.7.54-9, quoted above), Coleridge said, 'though usually thought to prove a

to Macbeth of the solemnity of his promise'; she tries 'to bully conscience'. See Samuel Taylor Coleridge,

Here, Harrison translates and distorts John Bellenden's Scots translation of Hector 
Boece's Scotorum historiae (1526, 1575), where Scottish mothers are specifically distin-
guished from English mothers. Bellenden writes: 

Ilk moder wes nurice to hir awin barne [Each mother was nurse to her own child]. It was ane 
suspition of adultre [adultery] aganis ony woman quhare hir milk failzeit, the wemen thocht yair

breist, as thay war nurist afore with the blude of thair wambe. Attoure [Moreover] thay held that 
thair barnis war dégénérât fra thair nature and kynd, gif thay war nurist with uncouth mylk.2 

Harrison omits Boece's claim that where the mother's milk 'fails' ('quhare hir milk 
failzeit'), the failure signals the mother's adultery. Further, Boece and Bellenden 
claim, milk from any woman other than the biological mother made the child so nursed 
'degenerate from their nature and kind' - that is, wet-nursing made the child non-
natural and from a genealogical or dynastic point of view invalid, a failed heir. 
However distortedly information about Scottish maternal practice may have de-
scended to Shakespeare and his audiences, Lady Macbeth's claim was at once terrible 
and unusual. An aristocratic, a royal, woman had 'given suck' and that nurturance 
would have been foreign to English aristocratic practice and her rejection of the 'babe' 
repulsive. Considered within the play's arguments over various lineal successions -
'proper' dynastic orderings - Lady Macbeth's vow and threat (1.7.54-9) violate not 
only a local, 'strange' Scottish practice, but also invalidate possibly royal succession 
from her body. Her language and that of Boece and Bellenden return the audience to 
the succession-crises in Act 1, Scenes 3 and 4, where the political conflicts with the 
familial and biological. 
Words and images of birth enter the play's dialogue often, but nowhere so compli-
catedly as in the choric Act 2, Scene 4: 

Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act, 
Threatens his bloody stage. By th'clock 'tis day 
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp. 
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame, 
That darkness does the face of earth entomb 
When living light should kiss it? 
(2.4.5-10) 

The heavens' 'bloody stage' is, of course, the theatre where we learn of Duncan's 
murder and the theatre where the murderous battles of Acts 1 and 5 take place, but it 
is also the 'bloody' moment of birth: 'travelling lamp' (the sun) puns through the 
Folio's spelling ('trauailing') on 'travailing' (labouring), a word that includes the

voyages around the Mediterranean: see the First Witch's mention of'th'shipman's card' at 1.3.16. Here, 
'Aleppo' (1.3.6) is marked, and a castle at the western end of the Mediterranean, indicating the mapmaker's

'labour' or 'travail' of giving birth.1 Here, the 'travelling [or 'trauailing', birthing] 
lamp', the sun (or son), contends with strangling night. Soon, murderous dark kills the 
light - 'Who did strike out the light?' (3.3.22) - and the witches later invoke a 'birth-
strangled babe', a child strangled in labour ('travail') or just after birth.2 In Act 3, 
Scene 3, Macbeth's hired murderers attack Fleance, a son who may grow up to be the 
'sun' to darkened Scotland; so, too, 'dark night' strangles the moving ('travelling') 
light of the sun, which is also the 'travailing' source, the mother-giving-birth, and 
son/sun of hope for the future. 
Prophecy is perhaps the sisters' most significant contribution to the play's intellec-
tual complexity and at the same time one of the play's most memorable theatrical and 
emotional effects. And the prophecies they offer are not only of future kingship ('All 
hail Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter' (1.3.48)), but of secure future kingship: 

Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn 
The power of man, for none of woman born 
Shall harm Macbeth. 
(4.1.78-80)3 

1 See OED Travail v and Travel v. 
z On the two possibilities, see 4.i.3on. below. 
3 Discussing similar political prophecies in 2H6, Jean E. Howard, The Stage and Social Struggle in Early 
Modern England, 1994, p. 135, appropriately cites Howard Dobin, Merlin's Disciples: Prophecy, Poetry and 

Macbeth 
yo] 

Tragic plots deeply involved with prophecy - the plots of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex or 
Macbeth, for example - paradoxically confound tragedy and human speculation about 
the tragic.1 Macbeth himself early and late understands prophetic irony: 

If chance will have me king, why chance may crown me 
Without my stir. 
(1.3.142-3) 

And be these juggling fiends no more believed 
That palter with us in a double sense, 
That keep the word of promise to our ear 
And break it to our hope . . . 
(5.8.19-22) 

To recognise irony is not to escape either irony or the temptations of prophecy, as 
Macbeth's response to the sisters' display in Act 4, Scene 1, shows: 

Then live, Macduff, what need I fear of thee? 
But yet I'll make assurance double sure 
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live, 
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies, 
And sleep in spite of thunder. 
(4.1.81-5) 

Macbeth instantly acts to confirm what he believes needs no confirmation. His 
planned and accomplished action, the murder of Lady Macduff and her children, 
makes fatal reality out of his over-confidence and his insecurity. Doubt and deaths are 
the paradoxical result of prophecy and paltering. 
Macbeth's perceptions prove otherwise diminished and diminishing. The destruc-
tive actions they justify make Macbeth a destructive fool, or a dupe, or the self-aware 
automaton who says: 

I am in blood 
Stepped in so far that should I wade no more, 
Returning were as tedious as go o'er. 
(3.4.136-8) 

and 

Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow 
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day 
To the last syllable of recorded time; 
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools 
The way to dusty death. 
(5.5.18-22) 
Macbeth's reflections are trapped at the level of human agency. He understands, but 
understands only, the tactics needed to become king and fulfil what he construes as 
prophecy. He castigates himself not for seeking the murderous ends he sought but for 
seeking them in an ineffective way, as he had in lamenting the failure of 'our poor 
malice' (3.2.14).

Macbeth

Unexpressed in Macbeth's seemingly helpless ironic perceptions is a larger diffi-
culty the prophecies pose - choice, or intended action, and hence responsibility for 
one's acts. If the prophecies are true before the play begins, or before Macbeth and 
Banquo hear them, or before Macbeth and Banquo have acted, where is the willed 
action that allows the audience to discover responsibility and hence to experience 
guilt? If Macbeth could never act otherwise, could never not choose to murder 
Duncan, and if, putatively, Banquo could never resist thoughts of usurpation, 'the 
cursed thoughts that nature / Gives way to in repose' (2.1.8-9), where is the tragedy, 
the dire consequence of an ignorant or misunderstood act, of these events? If, alterna-
tively, the prophecies only become true when they are enacted by responsible and 
hence arguably tragic and guilty human agents, how may they be called 'prophecies' at 
all? 
From a Christian perspective, the likely perspective of both Shakespeare and most 
of the original audiences, this conundrum represents 'the great debate of the [Euro-
pean] sixteenth and seventeenth centuries on the freedom of the will being turned into 
drama', as Helen Gardner remarked in a classic essay.1 According to Gardner, 'It 
never occurs to us that Macbeth will turn back, or indeed that he can . . . [A]long with 
this incapacity for change to a better state, or repentance, go two other closely related 
ideas': 

The initial act [i.e. the murder of Duncan] is an act against nature, it is a primal sin . . . and its 
author knows that it. . . [is] so. It is not an act committed by mistake; it is not an error of 
judgment, it is an error of will. The act is unnatural and so are its results; it deforms the nature 
which performs it. The second idea is the irony of retributive justice. The act is performed for 
an imagined good . . . but a rigorous necessity reigns and sees to it that. . . the desire is only 
granted ironically . . . [because] the desire is for something forbidden by the very nature of 
man.2 

While we should not unthinkingly assent to Gardner's Christian assertion (or assump-
tion) of 'the very nature of man', it seems unquestionable that Macbeth has not, as 
Gardner says of Marlowe's Dr Faustus, 'escaped the necessity of choice'.3 

Questions of the individual's freedom or boundedness in action and questions of the 
individual's responsibility or submission to some external agent (God, Fate, Neces-
sity) are the basic but not simple questions any prophetic act raises.4 By incorporating

know are wrong, citing Kierkegaard's 'dread of sin produces sin' (p. 435). Macbeth's purported inability 
to turn back is one version of the deadly Christian sin of despair; see Bettie Anne Doebler, "Rooted

Macbeth, at any rate in this first part of the play, the "virtual future" is not only the mode of the dramatic 
genre to which Macbeth belongs: it is also its subject. The early scenes of Macbeth are "about" the 
immediate future . . .' Compare G. K. Hunter's excellent discussion of the complex word 'security' 
(3.5.32) in his edition of the play, pp. 21-3, and the more general issue of whether the sisters act 
independently or as subordinates to still larger demonic energies.

Introduction 

prophecy in what the First Folio termed a 'Tragédie', Shakespeare, like Sophocles, 
presents but does not solve ageless human anxieties about how freely we may act in 
time. These anxieties are especially present for a Christian audience. A great deal of 
the play's emotional power derives from raising these complex anxieties and denying 
them resolution. Trying to decide whether the effect is 'tragic' or the play a 'tragedy' 
is beside the point. The point lies in the effort to resolve those questions, the effort to 
tame into thought and language what remains wild, inexplicable, compellingly dis-
turbing. Indeed, the play achieves its effects by not solving its questions and by 
conveying their undecidability through a brutal plot, magnificent language, and above 
all, the sisters. 

'WHAT DO YOU MEAN?': THE LANGUAGES OF 
MACBETH 
At least since the Restoration diarist Samuel Pepys recorded attending Macbeth - 'a 
pretty good play, but admirably acted'1 - on the fifty-ninth anniversary of the Gun-
powder Plot, 5 November 1664, and undoubtedly long before that, audiences have 
enjoyed its theatrical spectacle, its marvels and magic - what Pepys later called 
'variety' and 'divertisement'.2 Shakespeare's play has equal pleasures for the listening 
imagination. 
Despite the play's exciting linguistic variety, hostile comments from the seven-
teenth and the twentieth century attack its language. On unknown authority, John 
Dryden cited Ben Jonson, Shakespeare's greatest rival and (at least by the time he 
wrote a fine commendatory poem for the 1623 First Folio) eloquent admirer: 'In 
reading some bombast speeches of Macbeth, which are not to be understood, he 
[Jonson] used to say that it was horror; and I am much afraid that this is so.'3 Dryden 
himself asserted: 

he [Shakespeare] often obscures his meaning by his words, and sometimes makes it unintelligi-
ble .. . the fury of his fancy often transported him beyond the bounds of judgement, either in 
coining of new words and phrases, or racking words which were in use into the violence of a 
catachresis. 'Tis not that I would explode the use of metaphors from passions . . . but to use 'em 
at every word, to say nothing without a metaphor, a simile, an image, or description, is I doubt 
to smell a little too strongly of the buskin.4 

1 Robert Latham and William Matthews (eds.), The Diary of Samuel Pepys, 11 vols., 1970-83, v, 314. On 
this anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot, Pepys almost certainly saw William Davenant's adaptation, quite 
possibly its première; see Arthur H. Scouten, 'The premiere of Davenant's adaptation of Macbeth'1 in W. 
R. Elton and William B. Long (eds.), Shakespeare and Dramatic Tradition, 1989, pp. 286-93. 
2 Pepys, vu, 423 (28 December 1666), and vm, 7 (7 January 1667); Pepys describes William Davenant's 
adapted text which indeed contained, as he said, 'variety of dancing and music' (vm, 171; 19 April 1667). 
3 John Dryden, 'Defence of the epilogue', in George Watson (éd.), Of Dramatic Poesy and Other Critical 
Essays, 2 vols., 1962,1, 173. Dryden may be putting words in an elder and deeply respected playwright's 
mouth here, but 'it was horror' is none the less a peculiar phrase, allowing one to imagine Dryden's 
'Jonson' saying that the play's occasional linguistic confusion conveys 'horror' rather than that the play's 
language is horribly confused. 
4 'The grounds of criticism in tragedy', prefixed to Troilus and Cressida (1679), in Watson (éd.), Of Dramatic 
Poesy, 1, 257. Dryden gives no examples, but Macbeth is full of evocative but logically confusing (and 
therefore neo-classically offensive) figurative language: 'Was the hope drunk / Wherein you dressed 
yourself? Hath it slept since? / And wakes it now to look so green and pale / At what it did so freely?' 
(1.7.35-8), for example. 

Macbeth 
U4\ 

A. C. Bradley, a sympathetic late-Victorian reader of Macbeth, partly agrees: 'The 
diction has in places a huge and rugged grandeur, which degenerates here and there 
into tumidity.'1 Almost two-and-a-half centuries after Dryden's death, James Thurber 
imagined himself marooned in a hotel with reading matter as random and ill-assorted 
as that found in a dentist's waiting-room. One fellow-resident was stuck with Macbeth, 
which she found, Thurber says, 'a Murder Mystery'. She especially notes the moment 
when Macduff describes finding Duncan's body: 

'Macduff discovers it,' she said, slipping into the historical present. 'Then he comes running 
downstairs and shouts, "Confusion has broke open the Lord's anointed temple" and "Sacrile-
gious murder has made his masterpiece" and on and on like that.' The good lady tapped me on 
the knee. 'All that stuff was rehearsed,' she said. 'You wouldn't say a lot of stuff like that, 
offhand, would you - if you had found a body? . . . You wouldn't! Unless you had practiced it 
in advance. "My God, there's a body in here!" is what an innocent man would say.'2 

The lady's complaint echoes Dr Johnson on Milton's Lycidas: 'Where there is leisure 
for fiction there is little grief.' Here, Thurber's reader concludes, where there is leisure 
for personification there is little personal feeling. 
Dryden's possibly fictitious Jonson, and Dryden himself, and Bradley, and 
Thurber's imaginary reader all hear the play's linguistic, especially metaphorical, 
volatility, a volatility that sometimes reaches near-incomprehensibility in marvellous 
but unparaphrasable language: 

this Duncan 
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been 
So clear in his great office, that his virtues 
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued against 
The deep damnation of his taking-off. 
And pity, like a naked newborn babe 
Striding the blast, or heaven's chérubin horsed 
Upon the sightless couriers of the air, 
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, 
That tears shall drown the wind. 
(1.7.16-25) 

Come, seeling night, 
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day 
And with thy bloody and invisible hand 
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond 
Which keeps me pale. Light thickens, 
And the crow makes wing to th'rooky wood; 
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse, 
Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse. 
(3.2.46-53) 

Writers bold enough to comment on these speeches have generally admitted both 
defeat and admiration. Of the first passage, Dr Johnson said, 'the meaning is not very 

1 Bradley, p. 265; in a later (p. 310) comparison of Macbeth with Seneca, Bradley describes some of the 
play's language as 'turgid bombast'. 
2 James Thurber, My World-And Welcome To It, 1942, pp. 35-6. George Bernard Shaw achieves a similar 
effect in a burlesque of Act 1, Scenes 5 and 7, where Lady Macbeth's lines are mostly intact and Macbeth's 
are modern and colloquial (e.g. 'What the devil is a limbec?'); see Bernard Dukore (éd.), George Bernard 
Shaw, 'Macbeth Skit', Educational Theatre Journal 19 (1967), 343-8.

Introduction 

clear; I have never found the readers of Shakespeare agreeing about it'.1 The play has 
language to puzzle not only Johnson, but anyone. 
Rather than offer yet another interpretation of Macbeth's extraordinary speech on 
'pity, like a naked newborn babe', a speech eloquently discussed by Cleanth Brooks 
and Helen Gardner among many others,21 offer a shorter example, equally condensed 
and equally typical of the play's most complex way with words. When Ross and Angus 
ceremonially announce that Duncan has granted Macbeth a new title, 'Thane of 
Cawdor' (1.3.87-105), Macbeth divides into a public man, publicly acknowledging a 
deliberately public honour - 'Thanks for your pains', 'I thank you, gentlemen' 
(1.3.116, 128) - and into a musing, reflective mind seeking the links among sudden, 
new honour and the sisters' earlier predictions: 

Two truths are told, 
As happy prologues to the swelling act 
Of the imperial theme. 
(1.3.126-8) 

This small portion of Macbeth's speech shows the way the play's language, or, more 
precisely, the way this character's language, shifts from one verbal register or matrix 
to another. One matrix is the language of the theatre: 'prologues' are familiar introduc-
tory or explanatory figures who preface an entire play or an 'act' of one; after the 
prologue, an audience would expect the stage to fill (or 'swell') with other actors 
representing the persons and enacting the events the prologic character predicted or 
promised. Another matrix is the language of rhetoric and of music: 'theme' is a 
speaker's or thinker's subject or topic, or possibly (the meaning is barely established in 
the late sixteenth century) a recognisable - 'hearable' - set of repeated or varied notes.3 

'Two truths', Macbeth says, introduce an extended passage (of thought, argument, 
music) leading metaphorically to empery or kingship, and the 'imperial theme' turns 
from static to active, from contemplation to incitement. From mentally debating what 
it might be like to be king, Macbeth's reflection (or rather the highly compressed 
language Shakespeare gives the character) now introduces the possibility of acting to 
achieve kingship.4 A final linguistic matrix arises from the 'swelling' of a pregnant 
woman's body. Speaking to Banquo - 'Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none' 
(1.3.65) - the sisters raise the play's most intractable and profound issue, the questions 
of generation, children, inheritance, the prolonging of a familial line. Their emphasis 
is almost but not quite unremarked - 'Do you not hope your children shall be kings,

speech, see William Empson, Seven Types of Ambiguity, 1930, 3rd edn, 1953, pp. 18-20 and 81-2, and 
R. A. Foakes, 'Poetic language and dramatic significance in Shakespeare', in Philip Edwards et al. (eds.), 
Shakespeare's Styles, 1980, pp. 79-83. On their Hebridean walking tour, Samuel Johnson had to endure 
James BoswelPs numerous quotations ofMacbeth; see James Boswell, Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, ed. 
Frederick A. Pottle and Charles H. Bennett, 1961, passim, but esp. the entry (29 August 1773) recording 
their visit to 'Macbeth's Castle'.

3 On the musical meaning of 'theme', dated to 1597, see OED Theme 4; the rhetorical meaning (see 
1.3.128 n.) is far older. 
4 This shift or glide from a more or less abstract and static mental consideration to an active intention occurs 
often in the play; see, e.g., 1.5.14-23 and n.

'memory . . . Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason / A limbeck only' (1.7.65-7). The two limbecks 
shown here illustrate alchemical distillation in The Works ofGeber (1678), reproducing an image from the 
Latin edition of 1545. The limbeck on the right is set on a furnace. See Gareth Roberts, The Mirror of 
Alchemy, 1994 

/ When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me / Promised no less to them?' 
(1.3.117-19) - but with 'swelling' (of pregnancy or of impregnating penis) this brief 
passage acknowledges the possibility that the 'imperial' or royal goal might be barren, 
that the sisters 'Upon my head . . . placed a fruitless crown / And put a barren sceptre 
in my gripe'(3.1.62-3). 
In these passages, the play's language moves rapidly among many images and many 
linguistic possibilities; this shifting brings together the eloquent, the homely, the 
proverbial, and the brilliantly theatrical helter-skelter. Among many extraordinary 
verbal effects in Macbeth's reflection upon killing Duncan (i.7.i2ff.), for example, 
'waked newborn babe* subtly patterns the sounds of n and of />, making a rhetorical 
chiasmus of the middle term, 'newborn', where the sounds 'cross' and coexist.1 

This later passage, when Macbeth has determined to kill Banquo and Fleance, 
begins with Macbeth's intimate endearment, 'Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest 

1 A similar, more extended antimetabole using d and h appears in 'I will not be afraid of </eath and />ane / 
Till .Sirnam Forest come to Dunsinane' (5.3.60-1). Compare the different but similar auditory experience 
of'bear [bare?] the knife myself (16) and 'borne his faculties' (17).

Introduction 

chuck, / Till thou applaud the deed' (3.2.45-6). If a 'noble' hero may be so tender 
amidst the slaughter past and to come, and so bourgeois as to use 'chuck', a 'citizen' 
term,' then so too the man and child he would kill employ an innocently 'humble' 
diction: 

BANQUO How goes the night, boy? 
FLEANCE The moon is down; I have not heard the clock. 
BANQUO And she goes down at twelve. 
FLEANCE 
I take't, 'tis later, sir. 
(2.1.1-3) 

And when Banquo dies, a single pentameter unites a passing comment about the 
weather with the command for his death: 

BANQUO It will be rain tonight. 
FIRST MURDERER 
Let it come down. 
(3-3-i8) 

With little help from the dialogue, the actor playing Lady Macbeth must shift the 
audience's imagination from plot-orientated fact to gnawing moral self-examination: 

LADY MACBETH Is Banquo gone from court? 
SERVANT Ay, madam, but returns again tonight. 
LADY MACBETH Say to the king, I would attend his leisure 
For a few words. 
SERVANT 
Madam, I will. 
Exit 
LADYMACBETH 
Nought's had, all's spent 
Where our desire is got without content. 
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy 
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy. 
(3.2.1-7) 

Almost at once, Lady Macbeth must turn from self-reflection and seek to assuage 
Macbeth's scorpion-filled mind. 
Lady Macbeth's couplets (3.2.4-7) have a quasi-proverbial force, and many well-
known lines quote proverbs or have a substratum of proverbial language or thought.2 

One proverb, 'Things done cannot be undone', contributes to three strategically 
placed moments, at the beginning, the middle, and the end of the play: 

If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well 
It were done quickly. 
(1.7.1-2) 

Things without all remedy 
Should be without regard; what's done, is done. 
(3.2.11-12)3 

Come, come, come, come, give me your hand; what's done cannot be undone. To bed, to 
bed, to bed. 
(5-1-57-8) 

Sedimented, even ossified, commonplaces of wisdom or observation, proverbs and 
proverbial language make ordinary the play's events and the speakers' reactions while

simultaneously and starkly showing how far beyond the ordinary, the proverbial, the 
stony, these events and attitudes are: proverbs toll through important moments in Act 
3 - 'Men are but men'; 'Fair face foul heart'; 'And there's an end'; 'Blood will have 
blood.' 
The language of Macbeth combines sublime magniloquence - which the neo-
classical critics Ben Jonson, Dry den, and Dr Johnson found distasteful - with every-
day language that also has great theatrical power. After Duncan's murder is 
discovered, Macbeth has two speeches that certainly 'say nothing without a metaphor, 
a simile, an image': 

Had I but died an hour before this chance, 
I had lived a blessed time, for from this instant, 
There's nothing serious in mortality. 
All is but toys; renown and grace is dead, 
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees 
Is left this vault to brag of. 
(2.3.84-9) 
And then: 

Who can be wise, amazed, temp'rate, and furious, 
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man. 
Th'expedition of my violent love 
Outran the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan, 
His silver skin laced with his golden blood 
And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature, 
For ruin's wasteful entrance. There the murderers, 
Steeped in the colours of their trade; their daggers 
Unmannerly breeched with gore. Who could refrain, 
That had a heart to love and in that heart 
Courage to make's love known? 
(2.3.101-11) 
These speeches mix Macbeth's sorrow, which may be genuine, or partly so, with the 
lies needed to conceal guilt and win the kingship. 
In the brief interval between Duncan's murder and its discovery, Shakespeare faced 
a different dramatic problem. As in the aftermath of the discovery, Macbeth must 
conceal and deceive, but here - before Duncan's death is known - the problem is 
more acute because the moment (the porter with a hangover, the impatient noblemen) 
has a lower emotional temperature. Plainer, everyday language and rhetoric must 
convey the deceit. Thus, Macbeth's simple answer to Macduff's 'Is the king stirring, 
worthy thane?' so perfectly mixes deceit and truth that it deserves the gasp the line 
sometimes earns: 'Not yet' (2.3.38). 'Not yet' means, of course, both 'Duncan has not 
awakened until now' and 'Duncan will never again stir.' ('Not yet' = 'not so far' and 
'no longer'.) The effect is repeated and intensified when Lennox asks, 'Goes the king 
hence today?', and Macbeth replies, 'He does - he did appoint so.'1 Once again, 
Macbeth deceives and tells the truth as the witches do. He is the serpent but looks like 
the flower. The nerve-wrenching sequence concludes with Lennox's grand catalogue 

1 'Goes the king hence' is a euphemism for 'Does the king die'; see 1.5.57^

of portents, to which Macbeth replies truthfully and laconically, "Twas a rough night' 

(2-3-53)-1 

In the following act, similarly complex verbal simplicity greets the murderers: 'Well 
then, now have you considered of my speeches?' (3.1.77). Those first three words offer 
the actor an enormous range of possibilities.2 Are they off-hand conversational filler 
('Stand at ease', or 'Please be seated', or 'Listen to me', or 'Thank you for coming'), 
or the hesitant stutterings of a man ordering death, or the abrupt autocratic directions 
of a feared tyrant? At Stratford in 1955, Laurence Olivier 
stood centre-stage . . . The murderers stood down-stage, left and right respectively. Olivier 
glanced arrogantly from one to the other, crooked the index finger of each hand in terrible 
invitation and made 'well' into a question. He paused. The murderers looked at one another. The 
index fingers swept downwards and pointed straight at the floor on each side of him. He said 
'then' as a command. They moved slowly towards him like frightened stoats. Almost humor-
ously, but with an edge of impatience, he said 'now', and an act of hypnosis was completed.3 

Simple language, particularly euphemistic or indefinite language, continually coun-
terpoints the play's extravagant rhetoric and dense metaphor. Thus, murder appears 
as 'it' - 'If it were done' (1.7.1), 'so, it will make us mad' (2.2.37), 'Thou canst not say 
I did it' (3.4.50) - and the grooms' guilt-dispelling drunkenness joins Lady Macbeth's 
half-manic excitement at committing murder as 'that' - 'That which hath made them 
drunk, hath made me bold' (2.2.1). Later, death is 'absence' (3.1.135) and 'safe' 
(3.4.25), and 'sent to peace' (3.2.20), dead. 
A related linguistic register makes such indefinition a source of comedy: millions of 
obscene jokes and hundreds of dramatic scenes turn upon double, triple, or uncertain 
referents for 'it', or 'that', or equally innocuous words and phrases. While Macbeth has 
few comic moments and its wordplay is more often grim than fanciful, the way 
language blurs rather than clarifies, confuses rather than makes plain, connects palter-
ing sisters and self-deceiving criminals and jokey Porter. Thus, the Porter's words -
'come in', 'stealing out', 'it' (again), 'lie' (and 'lye'), 'shift' - duplicate, make more 
intense and trivial and painful, the same linguistic acts when Macbeth and his lady 
speak them. 
Appropriately for a play where prophecy and misunderstanding propel the action, 
paradox, oxymoron, antithesis, and self-contradiction fill the dialogue: 

One of the play's most haunting and pervasive stylistic characteristics is a speech-rhythm that 
constantly contracts into self-checking half-rhyming half-lines: a device, surely, that realizes the 
foreshortening, the terrible presentness which Macbeth forces on himself, an existence without 
breadth and without perspective.4 

1 Speaking this line, David Garrick 'shew[ed] as much self-condemnation, as much fear of discovery, as 
much endeavour to conquer inquietude and assume ease, as ever was infused into, or intended for, the 
character' (Thomas Wilkes, A General View of the Stage, 1759, p. 249).

Introduction 

Macbeth echoes the 'paltering' sisters - 'Fair is foul, and foul is fair' (1.1.12) - when 
he observes that the pathetic fallacy has failed: 'So foul and fair a day I have not seen' 
(1.3.36). It is a stormy yet victorious day, but victory and storm has each its place, its 
category, and neither can influence or change the other. They coexist, but they do not 
interpenetrate, and only the musing mind would or could find sunshine and victory 
appropriate, if unpredictable, companions. By contrast, the words Macbeth uncon-
sciously echoes are not a stable antithesis, a conversational bon mot as his remark is, but 
rather a worrying, endless, finally 'tedious' (3.4.138) and idiot-like (see 5.5.26) alterna-
tion: 'Fair is foul, and foul is fair' (1.1.12). For the witches, distinction exists only in 
its annihilation by or in alternation with its opposite. Categories - fair, foul - exist, but 
rather than being defined by difference or opposition, each is the other. 
Macbeth's speech absorbs the 'sickening see-saw rhythm'1 of witch-language -
'This supernatural soliciting / Cannot be ill, cannot be good' (1.3.129-30) - and he 
accurately echoes witch-thinking when he claims, 'nothing is, / But what is not' 
(1.3.140-1), a formulation precisely anticipating the Second Apparition's promise that 
'none of woman born / Shall harm Macbeth' (4.1.79-80) and encapsulating at this 
moment and the later one time, birth, imagination, ambition, and their various defects. 
The initial paradox (how can one predicate anything of 'nothing'?) is explained by a 
further paradox (all that is, is not), and both are understood when we recognise that 
Macbeth speaks of the difference between 'present' conditions and 'imaginings' of the 
future, though the former are 'fears' and the latter 'horrible'.2 None the less, his phrase 
denies reality or existence to both that which is and that which is not, to what he 
fantasises and what he imagines, to killing the king and being the king. In a play where 
submitting to or commanding time becomes a dominant issue, rhetorical conflict 
invades even the act of telling the time: echoing Banquo (2.1.1), Macbeth asks, 'What 
is the night?', and his wife replies, 'Almost at odds with morning, which is which' 
(3.4.126-7). Struggling with time and its consequences - birth and death, usurpation 
and punishment - Lord and Lady Macbeth sense time 'at odds' with itself, time now 
conflicting with time then and time to come. 
Lady Macbeth's 'which is which' echoes the play's varied use of repetition, ranging 
from alliteration and assonance to repeated words and phrases, and rhyme.3 Rhymes 
are the most easily heard and most easily remembered repetitions. They fill the sisters' 
speeches, which generally use trochaic tetrameter couplets, 'the fairy dialect of English 
literature', and Macbeth has more scenes that end with one or more couplets than any 
other Shakespearean play - both a higher proportion of such scenes, and the highest 

1 Knights, p. 20. 
2 Much later, Lady Macbeth speaks a similarly self-cancelling phrase, "Tis safer to be that which we 
destroy' (3.2.6). Here, the word 'present', as in 'Present fears', has already been used once of death 
(1.2.64) and o n c e of the honours Duncan bestows on Macbeth (1.3.53) a nd therefore represents both foul 
and fair. In Poets' Grammar, 1958, pp. 48-57, Francis Berry argues that 'the whole play is Future minded' 
and that the future indicative, especially associated with Lady Macbeth, 'drives the play', while Macbeth 
in this speech and elsewhere (e.g. 1.7.1 ff.) employs the future subjunctive.

10 'The King' by Hans Holbein the Younger (1538): an image from the 'dance of death', showing Death

absolute number of them.1 As well as rhyming, witch-language also alliterates - 'nine 
times nine . . . peak, and pine' (1.3.21-2) - but so does Macbeth's language: 

I had else been perfect; 
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, 
As broad and general as the casing air: 
But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in 
To saucy doubts and fears. 
(3.4.21-5) 

Beside the alliteration on c ('casing . . . cabined, cribbed, confined') and the abrupt 
tremor, ck, in 'rock', this passage exemplifies many of the play's more subtle verbal 
effects: the way 'doubts' echoes the ds of the past participles and the vowels of'bound' 
and 'founded', for example, or the way the 5-sound runs from 'else' to 'as' to 'casing' 
to 'saucy' and 'fears'.2 The word 'perfect' repeats more largely in the play and weaves

Introduction 

solicitation and over-confidence with guilt and death: it begins in Macbeth's 'Stay, you 
imperfect speakers' (1.3.68), continues in his letter ('the perfectest report' (1.5.2)), 
reappears in Banquo's death, which will make Macbeth's health 'perfect' (3.1.107) and 
require 'the perfect spy o'th'time' (3.1.129), and concludes in the Messenger's assur-
ance that he is 'perfect' in Lady Macduff's 'state of honour' (4.2.63).' 'Issue' also 
occurs frequently in the play. Before Act 5, Scene 4, we have heard it five times, each 
time with the meaning 'progeny' or 'children'; Siward then uses the word to mean 
'result, outcome': 'But certain issue strokes must arbitrate. / Towards which, advance 
the war' (5.4.20-1). At once, varied meanings - children, the future, a dynasty's 
existence, the outcome of war against a tyrant - coalesce. Macbeth's fear of the 
'unlineal hand' (3.1.64) depriving him of a 'fruitless crown' and Banquo's witch-
inspired hope of'children [who] shall be kings' (1.3.84) collide in 'issue', a word that 
now means not only 'children', but also victory or defeat, the result (the 'issue' and 
outcome) of an Anglo-Scottish war against Macbeth. 
These rhetorical, sonic, and logical devices spin the mind, whirl it into endless 
oscillation, but the play, brief and with an angrily forceful plot, also imposes a kind of 
imagistic claustrophobia. A. C. Bradley identified important features of the play's 
figurative language: 

Darkness . . . even . . . blackness, broods over this tragedy ... it [gives]... the impression of a 
black night broken by flashes of light and colour, sometimes vivid and even glaring . . . above all, 
the colour is the colour of blood.2 

Yet, like other critics eager to see bipolar oppositions in the play's language and 
structures, Bradley does not notice how complex the colour-associations are. 
Macbeth's famous 

Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood 
Clean from my hand? No: this my hand will rather 
The multitudinous seas incarnadine, 
Making the green one red. 
(2.2.63-6) 

powerfully puns on 'incarnadine', which means 'make red' and 'make flesh' or 'make 
flesh-coloured'. For a murderer, his own flesh, or his victim's, might be blood-red, or 
bloody, whatever the colour of the skin that covered that flesh. No simple code will 
decipher the play's chromatic figures. Black and darkness may often be evil, white and 
light good, red bloody, but the white of lily and linen is also cowardly, brightness 

a singular act - for Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, that act is murder - or move forward in time beyond or 
after the act. Compare Macbeth's soliloquy, 'Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow . . .' (5.5.18-27). 
1 For a discussion of the play's uses of'clear', see Doran, pp. 163-5. 'Present' is another repeated word; see 
e.g. 1.2.64, I-3-53> I-3-I36. Jûrgen Schàfer, Shakespeares Stil: Germanisches und Romanisches Vokabular, 
1973, Appendix 2, details Shakespeare's characteristic pairing of Germanic and romance synonyms in the 
play. Among many other significantly repeated words in Macbeth, consider 'strange', used in Macbeth 
more frequently (sixteen times) than in any other Shakespearean text except The Tempest (eighteen times), 
and note that both The Tempest and Macbeth are unusually short Shakespearean plays (see pp. 23-4 above) 
and that the audience might therefore hear the word's repetition with unusual force. Only Measure for 
Measure (fifteen times), Antony and Cleopatra (fourteen times), and Much Ado About Nothing (eleven 
times) use 'strange' more frequently than ten times among the First Folio plays. 
2 Bradley, pp. 266^-7. 

Macbeth 
\54\ 

Satanic, red the colour of courage and the 'painting' of a drunkard's nose, and dark 
night the time of restorative sleep.1 Shakespeare often uses repeated (or 'iterative') 
images and 'image clusters',2 and Macbeth brims with images of light and dark, of 
contraction and expansion (dwarf and giant, for example), of liquids (water, wine, 
milk, urine, blood), of horses that throw their riders or eat each other, of birds good 
and bad (owls, ravens, wrens, sparrows, hawks, eagles, martlets), of clothing (robes, 
seams, linings, sleeves, breeches), of procreation (children, eggs), and of sounds 
(knells, crickets, owls, clocks, bells, trumpets, knockings).3 

Verbal and non-verbal sounds are especially prominent as fact and image in Act 2, 
Scene 2, where Macbeth hallucinates, it seems, a voice murdering sleep and Lady 
Macbeth hears both the sounds of nature (the owl's shriek, the crickets' cry) and her 
husband's steps as he returns from killing Duncan. The uncanny and indefinite 'voice' 
Macbeth hears (2.2.38) echoes the 'voice' of the crown Lady Macbeth hears, or says or 
thinks she hears, in Act 1, Scene 5. Later, with a gallantry both futile and ironic, 
Macduff tries to shield Lady Macbeth from knowledge of her crime: 

O gentle lady, 
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak. 
The repetition in a woman's ear 
Would murder as it fell. 
(2.3.76-9) 

'Repetition in a woman's ear' murders as it falls again and again in Act 5, Scene 1, 
when Lady Macbeth repeats the echoing Knock of Act 2, Scene 3, and obsessively 
repeats words and actions: 

No more o'that, my lord, no more o'that. . . To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate. Come, 
come, come, come, give me your hand; what's done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed. 
(5.1.37-8, 56-8) 

Sound-as-sound and sound-as-image make a brief moment wonderfully evocative. 
Macbeth reassures his wife: 

ere the bat hath flown 
His cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate's summons 
The shard-born beetle with his drowsy hums 
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done 
A deed of dreadful note. 
LADY MACBETH 
What's to be done? 
MACBETH Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, 
Till thou applaud the deed. 
(3.2.40-6) 

1 Notable productions or adaptations of Macbeth in Africa and elsewhere demonstrate the imagery's 
malleability; consider e.g. Adrian Stanley's so-called 'Zulu' Macbeth, Glamis («V!) Stadium, 1961, in what 
was then Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (see Johannesburg Star, 5 April 1961, and The Sphere, 3 June 
1961); The Black Macbeth, London, March 1972; Natal Theatre Workshop's production of Welcome 
Msomi's UMabatha, Aldwych Theatre, London, April 1972, which was revived at the Civic Theatre, 
Johannesburg, June 1995 (see Philip Revzin, 'A Zuluized "Macbeth'", The Wall Street Journal, 14 June 
1995, p. A16). For U.S. examples, see Ruby Cohn, Modern Shakespeare Offshoots, 1976, pp. 60-73, starting 
with Orson Welles's 'voodoo' Macbeth (New York, 14 April 1936).

Before Lady Macbeth may applaud, before she claps as a theatre audience might (or so 
Macbeth hopes), at the deaths of Banquo and Fleance, husband, wife, and audience 
must hear an insect's sleepy humming as the sound of a church bell ringing the death 
of a day's labour, or the death of a parishioner. Tolling, the bell's open 'mouth' seems 
a human yawn, but its sound - its 'note' - marks and invites murder, the dreadful 
deed, the 'dreadful note', and the notably infamous. Hearing another, not metaphori-
cal, bell, Macbeth went to an earlier crime: 

The bell invites me. 
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell 
That summons thee to heaven or to hell. 
(2.1.62-4) 

Macbeth 
[56] 

The 'knelP returns twice more, tolling for the dead of Scotland, especially Macduff s 
family and retainers (4.3.172-3), and then for Siward's son (5.9.17). 
With so much else that has become drained of meaning, sound loses its terror 
for Macbeth when he nears his end. Senses - taste, hearing, vision - marry in 
death: 

I have almost forgot the taste of fears; 
The time has been, my senses would have cooled 
To hear a night-shriek and my fell of hair 
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir 
As life were in't. I have supped full with horrors; 
Direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts 
Cannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry? 
SEYTON The queen, my lord, is dead. 
MACBETH 
She should have died hereafter; 
There would have been a time for such a word. 
(5-5-9-1?) 
Macbeth's last phrase, 'a time for such a word', joins time with language, timing 
with speech, and directs us to the characters' recurrent failures to synchronise their 
words with events. There never should have been a 'time' for a word so infective as 
'hail' - 'All hail Macbeth, that shalt be king' nor, Macbeth wishes, should there ever 
have been a time for so profoundly weary a word - 'She should have died' - as 
'hereafter'. This moment's 'hereafter' became inevitable once there was a time when 
Macbeth heard the word first: 'All hail Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter" (1.3.48; 
my italics). 

Macbeth in performance 

The history of Macbeth performed shows that there are only a few main production 
decisions. The answers make a performance taxonomy that persists through changes 
in costume and cast, changes in political and social emphases, changes in ideas of 
heroism, of the supernatural, and of the relation between women and men, parents and 
children, humankind and time. Equally, the history of Macbeth on stage shows how 
difficult theatrical interpretation, like dramatic criticism, has found those decisions. 
How should the sisters be represented? When did the idea of killing Duncan occur to 
Macbeth or Lady Macbeth? Which of the two is the stronger, the more resourcefully 
dedicated to death and supremacy? How should an actor perform what Michael 
Redgrave called the 'notoriously' difficult part of Macbeth? Redgrave specified the 
apparent contradiction that Macbeth 'is described as noble and valiant', although 
'during the whole play we see him do nothing that is either noble or valiant'.1 Should 
the audience witness a palpable Ghost of Banquo in Act 3, Scene 4, or should the actor 
playing Macbeth in sheer imagination create the ghost as he created the dagger in Act

Lady Macbeth not only appears more than in the second but exerts the ultimate deciding influence on the 
action'.

PERFORMANCE AND ADAPTATION 
BEFORE 180O 
Macbeth seems always to have been a popular play on stage and in print. It is one of 
Shakespeare's most frequently performed plays since 1660 in England and later in 
other places and has been often revised, reimagined, and adapted to other media 
(opera, crime and historical novels, popular songs, silent and sound films, television, 
video, etc.), travestied, burlesqued, used as a starting point for satire, and employed in 
political cartoons and commercial advertising.2 

Although no one can know how Jacobean professionals presented Macbeth (see 
Appendix 1, pp. 264-7 below), it is one of the handful of Shakespearean plays for 
which an early eyewitness account survives. Dr Simon Forman - astrologer, quack, 
accomplice in the poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury, adviser to the Privy Council 
during the investigation of the Gunpowder Plot3 - claims he witnessed a Globe 
performance of Macbeth, most likely in 1611: 

In Mackbeth at the Glob[e], 1610 [i.e. 1611?], the 20 of Aprill. . . [Saturday], ther was to be 
observed, firste, howe Mackbeth and Bancko, 2 noble men of Scotland, Ridinge thorowe a wod 
[wood], the[re] stode before them 3 women feiries or Nimphes, And saluted Mackbeth, sayinge, 
3 tyms unto him, haille Mackbeth, king of Codon; for thou shalt be a kinge, but shalt beget No 
kinges, &c. Then said Bancko, What all to Mackbeth And nothing to me. Yes, said the nimphes, 
haille to thee Bancko, thou shalt beget kinges, yet be no kinge. And so they departed & cam to 
the Courte of Scotland to Dunkin king of Scotes, and yt was in the dais of Edward the 
Confessor. And Dunkin bad them both kindly wellcome, And made Mackbeth forth with Prince 
of Northumberland, and sent him horn to his own castell, and appointed Mackbeth to provid 
for him, for he would sup with him the next dai at night, & did soe. And Mackebeth contrived 
to kill Dunkin, & thorowe the persuasion of his wife did that night Murder the kinge in his own 
Castell, beinge his guest. And ther were many prodigies seen that night & the dai before. And 
when Mack Beth had murdred the kinge, the blod on his handes could not be washed of[f] by 

1 Commenting on productions since 1955, Michael Billington offers this summary view: 'First, the play 
cannot work without a magnetic central pair: it is much more a star vehicle than a company show. Second, 
though it needs a consistent imaginative world, no amount of hectic design can compete with Shake-
speare's poetic scene painting. Third[,] it is a play of breathless narrative excitement which appears 
broken-backed once you slice it in half [by introducing an interval]' (The Guardian, 27 September 1995).

Kliman, Shakespeare in Performance: 'Macbeth', 1992; Cohn, chapter 2. There is no narrative history of 
Macbeth's uses in song, novel, advertisement, etc., but see Thomas Wheeler, 'Macbeth': An Annotated

Macbeth, which are second in number only to those of Hamlet. For actors' written discussions of the

slewe Mackbet. 
Observe Also howe Mackbetes quen did Rise in the night in her slepe, & walke and talked and

Forman's description deviates from the Folio narrative (e.g. Macbeth as 'Prince of 
Northumberland' rather than Malcolm as Prince of Cumberland; Macbeth as 'king of 
Codon' rather than Thane of Cawdor; a scene of bloody handwashing after the 
murder) and records some questionable details - Raphael Holinshed's account of 
Macbeth's reign (read or remembered) apparently 'contaminates' Forman's diary-
entry - but there can be little doubt that Forman saw Macbeth, probably on the day, 
month, and year (adjusted for an easy error)2 he says he did. 
Aside from Forman's account and the probable early revision of the play by Thomas 
Middleton (see Textual Analysis, pp. 255-9 below), evidence of the play's history 
before 1660 is mostly speculative: John Webster echoes Macbeth 2.2.57-8,4.3.221, and 
5.1.37 in The White Devil (c. 1612); ghost-scenes in Thomas Middleton's The Puritan 
(1607) and Francis Beaumont's The Knight of the Burning Pestle (c. 1608, printed 1613) 
may record other dramatists' responses to Banquo's Ghost in Macbeth Act 3, Scene 
4; the anonymous Thorny Abbey, or The London Maid (c. 1615, first printed in 
Gratiae Théâtrales, 1662) uses Holinshed's King Duff narrative, probably because 
Macbeth did; Middleton's A Game at Chess (1624) imitates Macbeth Act 4, Scene 3; 
Henry Killigrew's The Conspiracy (1635) may imitate the use of the Murderers in

2 20 April was a Saturday in 1611, not 1610 (as Forman's manuscript has it): the error (if it is one) is 
plausible because Jacobeans dated the new year in two ways, from 1 January, the modern practice, and 
from 25 March (the legal year); if Forman thought about years in the latter style, '1611' would have been 
less than a month old on 20 April, and he might have made what is still a common mistake after the 'new' 
year begins. Forman's probable borrowings from Holinshed are discussed by Leah Scragg, 'Macbeth on 
horseback', S.Sur. 26 (1973), 81-8, and the critical significance of Forman's 'errors' by Stephen Orgel,

or another early actor of the part reacted to Banquo's Ghost, or how an early audience 
expected an actor to react upon seeing a stage-ghost: 

When thou art at thy Table with thy friends 
Merry in heart, and fild with swelling wine, 
Il'e come in midst of all thy pride and mirth, 
Invisible to all men but thy selfe, 
And whisper such a sad tale in thine eare, 
Shall make thee let the Cuppe fall from thy hand, 
And stand as mute and pale as Death it selfe.1 

About 1639-42, John Milton jotted notes on subjects for plays or poems, including 
- after a detailed outline of'Adam unparadiz'd' - 'Scotch [histories or rather brittish 
of the north parts'. Among his proposed subjects were: 

Duffe, & Donwald 
a strange story of [deleted: revenging] witchcraft, & murder discover'd, & reveng'd. Scotch 
[hi]story. 149. &c. 

Kenneth 
who having privily poison'd Malcolm Duffe, that his own son might succeed is slain by Fenela. 
Scotch hist[ory]. p. 157. 158. &c. 
Macbeth 
beginning at the arrivall of Malcolm at Mackduffe. The matter of Duncan may be express't by 
the appearing of his ghost.2 

Milton's numerals refer to pages in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), and Milton's sub-
jects include the three Holinshed-narratives Shakespeare apparently consulted in 
writing Macbeth. The note on 'Macbeth' envisages a Greek-derived tragedy, like 
Milton's Samson Agonistes, in which the action would begin with Macbeth Act 4, Scene 
3, and use Duncan's ghost as a narrator of prior events.3 While these notes do not 
mention Shakespeare's Macbeth, Milton could certainly have known the performed 
and printed play; he wrote a splendid commendatory poem for the Second Folio 
(1632), and in his Poems (1645) famously described 'the well-trod stage' where 'sweet-
est Shakespear fancies childe / Warble[s] his native Wood-notes wilde' ('L'Allegro', 
lines 131 and 133-4). Milton's knowledge of both Shakespeare performed and the 
theatre may have been direct: his father (also John Milton) apparently served as a 
trustee of the King's Men's Blackfriars theatre property for Richard Burbage's widow 
Winifred and her children after the famous actor's death in 161 g.4 

From the period of Milton, two important promptbooks of Macbeth have been 
identified: the 'Padua' promptbook of c. 1625-35 (a copy of the 1623 Folio named for 

1 The Knight of the Burning Pestle, 1613, sig. r$r, slightly modernised.

its present custodian, the University of Padua library) and the 'Smock Alley' 
promptbook of c. 1674-82 (a copy of the 1663-4 Folio named for the Dublin theatre 
in which it was performed).1 Although the Padua promptbook may not report the 
earliest public theatre-practices, it fascinatingly records a performance text predating 
those that the Restoration's very different cultural and professional circumstances 
created. Remarkably, the Padua promptbook anticipates later acting texts by reducing 
the Folio's verbal density: the 'hard' language of Macbeth's speeches in Act 1, Scenes 
3 and 7, is trimmed; the Porter's part is cut entirely, as is Macbeth's interview with the 
murderers in Act 3, Scene 1; in Act 4, Scene 2, Ross loses his most impenetrable 
language (from 'I dare not speak' to 'Each way and none'); Macbeth's powerful 
soliloquy (Act 5, Scene 3) on 'the sere, the yellow leaf is cut; the other three Witches of 
Act 4, Scene 1, disappear, though Hecate may remain. 
Political or religious concerns may have motivated some of these and other cuts: 
Macbeth's soliloquy on royal pathos ('To be thus is nothing . . .') in Act 3, Scene 1, is 
harshly treated, and his now celebrated soliloquy, 'I have lived long enough . . .' 
(5.3.22 ff.), implying a desire for death, may have been cut for the same reason; 
concerns about blasphemy, profanity or simply 'inappropriate' comedy might account 
for the Porter's disappearance here as they seem to do in later theatrical versions. 
Padua also makes more obviously practical (and later very popular) cuts: Act 3, Scene 
6, is deleted, for instance, and Act 4, Scene 3, loses more than sixty lines, though part 
of the English Doctor episode remains. The Padua promptbook is also the first known 
document to specify a 'Cauldrone' in the opening stage direction for Act 4, Scene 1, 
and interestingly directs Macbeth to enter before the last line of Lady Macbeth's 
opening speech of Act 2, Scene 2, 'Whether they [the comatose grooms] live or die'.2 

The Smock Alley promptbook has been influenced by William Davenant's Restora-
tion adaptation, possibly as seen in the theatre rather than read in the 1674 text. Like 
Davenant, the persons who marked the Dublin promptbook reduced the Jacobean 
text's verbal complexity, cut or combined several of Shakespeare's thanes and messen-
gers, and severely reduced the Porter's rôle, but allowed Lady Macbeth to appear in 
Act 2, Scene 3, as many later theatre texts did not. The adapters 'Clearly . . . have one 
aim in mind: entertainment at any cost'.3 

The quarto Macbeth published in 1673 may represent a revised version performed 
before the theatres were closed in 1642 or just after professional playing legally 
resumed about 1660. William Davenant's adaptation, published posthumously in

1, i (General Introduction, Introduction to Padua Macbeth, collations), 1, ii (facsimile of Padua Macbeth), 
and v, i (Introduction and collations to Smock Alley Macbeth) and v, ii (facsimile of Smock Alley

Macbeth, based on F2 and probably prepared for amateur performance at an English Roman Catholic 
foundation in France; see G. Blakemore Evans, 'The Douai Manuscript - six Shakespearean transcripts

1674, but probably performed in 'December 1666 or . . . [in] November 1664',' sup-
planted the Folio version until 1744, when David Garrick offered London audiences 
a text closer to the Folio.2 Thereafter, Davenant's version gave way slowly (Spranger 
Barry used it at Covent Garden in the 1750s, for example), and some of Davenant's 
lines and stage business have persisted into twentieth-century productions.3 Colley 
Cibber, who knew only Davenant's adaptation on stage, thought that Mrs Betterton, 
'tho' far advanc'd in Years', outstripped her younger competitor Mrs Barry - superior 
in 'Strength, and Melody of Voice' - because Mrs Betterton commanded 'quick and 
careless Strokes of Terror, from the Disorder of a guilty Mind'.4 Samuel Pepys, also 
knowing only Davenant's adapted spectacle, identified a singular oddity: the play 
'appears a most excellent play in all respects, but especially in divertisement, though 
it be a deep tragedy; which is a strange perfection in a tragedy, it being most proper 
here and suitable'.5 

An anonymous pamphlet, An Essay on Acting. . . of a certain fashionable faulty 
actor. . . [with] A short criticism on his acting of Macbeth (1744), apparently David 
Garrick's effort to promote his own first appearance in the part (7 January 1744),6 

satirises the acting tradition as Garrick found it. Garrick's contemporary rival was 
James Quin, and the pamphlet attacks Quin's Macbeth - a 'Man . . . out of his Depth' 
- in Act 2, Scene 2, by pretending to criticise Garrick's performance: 

he [the actor playing Macbeth] should not rivet his Eyes to an imaginary Object [the dagger], as 
if it really was there, but should shew an unsettled Motion in his Eye, like one not quite awak'd 
from some disordering Dream; his Hands and Fingers should not be immoveable, but 
restless . .. Come let me clutch theel is not to be done by one Motion only, but by several succes

almost feel the Agonies of the Murderer himself.7 

Whatever any spectator felt then, my blood runs as cold as Quin's must have done at 
this savaging of a style now found over-declamatory and over-acted. Garrick's own

'Shakespeare's play' (Scouten, p. 290), since it makes some 'editorial' changes and includes two additional 
witch song-routines; see Appendix 2, pp. 268-70 below. Some of Davenant's changes are discussed in 
Appendix 2, but they are too extensive and interesting for easy summary; see, in part, Hazelton Spencer,

Introduction 

Object, as if it really was there' - became a kind of hallmark and travelling party-piece 
which received extravagant praise.1 

Satire obscures Garrick's complaints, but he apparently attacks a traditional piece of 
business when he pretends to praise the way Macbeth first toasts the absent Banquo 
and then recognises the Ghost: 

the Glass of Wine in his Hand should not be dash'd upon the Ground, but it should fall gently 
from him, and he should not discover the least Consciousness of having such a Vehicle in his 
Hand, his Memory being quite lost in the present Guilt and Horror of his Imagination.2 

This passage seemingly means that Garrick found Quin's nerveless 'Horror' inappro-
priate and preferred a violent dashing of the glass. Later anecdote records Quin's 
reactions to his young rival's performance, including surprise at the 'new' (actually 
Shakespearean and newly restored) imprecation, 'The devil damn thee black, thou 
cream-faced loon. / Where got'st thou that goose-look?' (5.3.11-12).3 

Through superb talent, assiduous amateur scholarship, and adroit self-promotion, 
Garrick made himself a star not only in the theatre but among an Enlightenment 
constellation - Samuel Johnson, David Hume, Joshua Reynolds - that equalled any in 
the continental European galaxy. One contemporary is wholly adulatory and, signifi-
cantly, praises Garrick's performance of the later acts: 

Garrick could alone comprehend and execute the complicated passages of Macbeth. From the 
first scene, in which he was accosted by the witches to the end of the part, he was animated and 
consistent.4 

While Garrick's Macbeth exploited the best contemporary scholarship (that of 
Theobald, Johnson, Warburton, and Styan Thirlby),5 his text also made many of the 
same cuts as Davenant and included a good deal of Davenant's supposedly unaccept-
able writing.6 Davenant had Macbeth die on-stage with a single line, 'Farewell vain 

1 On Garrick's second Parisian visit in July 1765, 'en chambre, dans son habit ordinaire, sans aucun secours 
de l'illusion théâtrale', Garrick delivered the speech to a rapt audience; see F. A. Hedgcock, Un Acteur 
cosmopolite: David Garrick et ses amis français, 1911, p. 25. On the same tour, Charles Collé's diary records 
another semi-private performance of the dagger-scene as 'une espèce de pantomime tragique' (Hedgcock, 
p. 65). Such recital-demonstrations, including scores of dagger-scenes where Garrick's powers before a 
non-English-speaking audience were especially praised, became common during his continental visits; see 
Hedgcock, pp. 115-19, for France, and Thomas Davies, Dramatic Micellanies [sic], 3 vols., 1783-4,11,141, 
for Italy.

3 'And when he [Quin] heard Garrick declaiming: "The devil damn . . . that goose-look?" he asked him 
where he had found such strange language' (Percy Fitzgerald, A New History of the English Stage, 2 vols., 
1882, 11, 162). Garrick's promptbook omits the oath, though it keeps the 'undignified' goose-reference 
(Bartholomeusz, p. 74).

6 Like Davenant, Garrick omitted the Porter of Macbeth 2.3, most of 4.2 (Lady Macduff and her son), most 
of Malcolm's self-accusation in 4.3, and 5.2; see Stone; Burnim, chap. 6, esp. p. 104; Bartholomeusz, chap. 
4. Garrick also retained many of Davenant's genteelisms - e.g. replacing 'stool' (3.4.68) with 'chair', a 
change that remained in Macready's text (Downer, p. 332). 

Macbeth 
[64] 

World, and what's most vain in it, Ambition*, which Garrick replaced with his own 
execrable pastiche - a blend of Dryden and Marlowe: 

'Tis done! the scene of life will quickly close. 
Ambition's vain, delusive dreams are fled, 
And now I wake to darkness, guilt and horror; 
I cannot bear it! let me shake it off-
'Two' not be; my soul is clogg'd with blood -
I cannot rise! I dare not ask for mercy -
It is too late, hell drags me down; I sink, 
I sink - Oh! - my soul is lost for ever! 
Oh!1 

David Garrick's performances as Macbeth were supported by those of Hannah 
Pritchard as Lady Macbeth - he effectively abandoned the rôle after her retirement -
and he remains perhaps the only English actor to have conquered the part (see 
illustration 13). Almost two centuries later, a distinguished critic succinctly praised 
and faulted Laurence Olivier by comparing him to Garrick: 'Since it would seem that 
with the exception of Garrick a great Macbeth has never been in the calendar, it is 
reasonable to expect that the new one should be lacking in perfect adequacy.'2 

John Philip Kemble, eighteenth-century London's other memorable Macbeth, was, 
like Garrick, a distinguished actor-manager; like Garrick, Kemble rejoiced in a superb 
Lady Macbeth (Sarah Siddons, his sister); like Garrick, Kemble cultivated a reputa-
tion as a scholarly exponent of the 'true', as opposed to the adapted or revised, 
Shakespearean text. Contemporary accounts and Kemble's promptbook show that his 
performances, also like Garrick's, kept much of Davenant's adaptation and even 
further reduced the material which neo-classical taste found unacceptable. Kemble's 
performances also increased the spectacle: though Shakespeare's three witches were 
treated fairly seriously, Kemble deployed a chorus of fifty or more singing, dancing, 
comic witches from at least 1794 onward.3 Lady Macduff and her son vanish, and their 
deaths are reported only; the Porter is omitted. And, continuing long theatrical 
practice, the dialogue's coruscating metaphor is reduced yet further.4 

Kemble was 'An actor whose style combined an unswerving, even regularity with 
occasional outbursts of great emotion'; his manner and physique made him an excep-
tional Coriolanus but a less exceptional Macbeth. Since, however, he 'specialized in

the subjective presentation of excited mental states in characters whose grip on ex-
terior reality was at best tenuous',1 his Macbeth complemented Sarah Siddons's 
famous Lady Macbeth: 

Macbeth in Kemble's hand is only a co-operating part. I can conceive Garrick to have sunk Lady 
Macbeth as much as Mrs Siddons does Macbeth, yet when you see Mrs Siddons play this part 
you scarcely can believe that any acting could make her part subordinate . . . She turns Macbeth 
to her purpose, makes him her mere instrument, guides, directs, and inspires the whole plot. 
Like Macbeth's evil genius she hurries him on in the mad career of ambition and cruelty from 
which his nature would have shrunk.2

Macbeth 
[66] 

The actor who - quite contrary to Garrick's lunging astonishment - greeted the sisters 
in Act i, Scene 3, 'with marked inattention and indifference . . . in a stately posture, 
waving the hand with studied dignity', became at the end of Act 1, Scene 5, a much 
subdued figure, with Siddons's Lady Macbeth 'Leading him out, cajoling him, her 
hand on his shoulder clapping him'.1 

Returning with the bloody daggers and uncertain of the Lady's whereabouts, 
Kemble's Macbeth spoke the lines from 'Didst thou not hear a noise?' (2.2.14) 'like a 
horrid secret - a whisper in the dark' and at the end of the scene stood 
'motionless . . . his eye fixed . . . quite rooted to the spot', and Siddons's Lady 
Macbeth repeats some of the action from Act 1, Scene 5: 

Then alarm steals on her, increasing to agony lest his reason be quite gone and discovery be 
inevitable. Strikes him on the shoulder, pulls him from his fixed posture, forces him away, he 
talking as he goes.2 

Sarah Siddons's Lady Macbeth overshadowed her brother's Macbeth,3 though the 
turning-point in the characters' relative 'strength' occurred, in their performances as 
in so many others, during the banquet scene (Act 3, Scene 4). More than 150 years 
later, Edith Evans commented on Lady Macbeth's 'usually inexplicable collapse' in 
Act 3, Scene 4 (or somewhere unseen by the audience between that scene and Act 5, 
Scene 1), and explained why she had never taken the part: 'there's a page missing' -
that is, Shakespeare did not supply the character with a bridge or motivation for the 
change.4 Kemble - repeating Garrick's business - violently threw his cup of wine 
when the Ghost first appears; one commentator sarcastically demanded a return to 
Quin's 'Horror of his Imagination'.5 On the Ghost's second appearance, Garrick's

Facsimile of Glen Byam Shaw's 7955 Promptbook, 1976, p. 91). 
3 Many observers commented on what one called Kemble's 'calm, slow, phlegmatic enunciation, oftentimes 
carried to affectation' and did not enjoy the way he spoke Macbeth's soliloquy opening Act 1, Scene 7: 
iike a speech to be recited' and 'the sedate, determined reasoning of a cool logician . . . the serene and calm 
reflection of a metaphysical speculator'. See, respectively, for the first and third quotations, A. B. G., 
Critical Observations, pp. 21 and 24, and for the second, G. J. Bell in Jenkin, p. 45. The same criticism was 
made much later of Henry Irving's delivery of this soliloquy as 'calm, cold, over-logical. . . passionless' 
{Sheridan Knowles' Conception, p. 13). 
4 Edith Evans, quoted in Jack Tinker's review of the Dench-McKellen Macbeth, Daily Mail, 10 September 
1976; Tinker continues: 'Miss Dench . . . lets us read that missing page. First, by exerting a powerful 
sexual sway over her husband . . . Then, finding her support brusquely rejected once he has come to 
power, she is a shattered ghost by the time she has to officiate at the otherwise ghostless feast.' The Edith 
Evans anecdote may well be apocryphal: another 'nice story' attributes her refusal to play Lady Macbeth 
to 'the lady's "lack of hospitality"' (Janet Suzman in Carole Woddis (éd.), 'Sheer Bloody Magic': 
Conversations with Actresses, 1991, p. 105). For other twentieth-century testimony here, see Maxine 
Audley (Lady Macduff, Stratford, 1955), p. 81 below.

Introduction 

practice seems to have been undecided, sometimes horrified and immobile, sometimes 
vigorously forcing the Ghost off-stage.1 

The moment raises two further questions: does the audience see the Ghost? and 
how does Lady Macbeth respond to the Ghost? Literary and theatrical critics made 
the first choice turn on some over-realistic questions: if the Ghost of Act 3, Scene 4, 
is visible to Macbeth and the audience but not to the guests or to Lady Macbeth, then 
(critics agree) our awareness associates us with guilty Macbeth. Shakespeare was not 
so logically scrupulous. Both Banquo and Macbeth see the witches in Act 1, Scene 3, 
and the Folio text clearly expects the audience to see the witches in Act 3, Scene 5, and 
Act 4, Scene 1, though in the last case, Lennox has witnessed neither witches nor 
apparitions. If we believe Simon Forman's Jacobean account, the Ghost seems to have 
been visible from the earliest performances, but when Kemble reopened Drury Lane 
on 21 April 1794 with the young Edmund Kean, according to legend, as one of the 
many goblins, Kemble omitted a visible Ghost of Banquo and thus initiated a long 
theatrical and critical debate.2 Kemble 'chid and scolded' the Ghost, imagined or not, 
'and rose in vehemence and courage as he went on', but Mrs Siddons, defying 
contemporary critics - who generally maintained that Lady Macbeth does not here 
know of Banquo's death and supposes Macbeth is reliving the murder of Duncan -
'imagined that the last appearance of Banquo's ghost became no less visible to her 
[Lady Macbeth's] eyes than it became to those of her husband'.3 Once the Ghost 
(invisible to the audience) is driven off and the guests are chaotically dismissed, Mrs 
Siddons's Lady Macbeth was 'Very sorrowful. Quite exhausted'. Kemble exited 
strongly, leaving her to follow.4 

LATER STAGINGS AND 
VERSIONS 
The theatrical and critical history of Macbeth often reflects changing social attitudes 
towards women and towards the relations between women and men.s Even after David 

1 See Bartholomeusz, pp. 67-8. 
2 For the possibility that Kemble was the first producer to omit the visible ghost, and for Kean as 'goblin', 
see William Winter, Shakespeare on the Stage, series 1, 1911, pp. 461 and 466, respectively. For Banquo's 
Ghost, see Mrs Siddons's account in Campbell, Life, 11, 185-7. Kemble 'restored it [the Ghost] only some 
years later' (Donohue, 'Kemble and Mrs Siddons in Macbeth'1, p. 82); the Ghost does not enter in the late 
Siddons promptbook (Mrs Inchbald's British Theatre, 1808, vol. 4, p. 44; compare Bell in Jenkin, p. 35) 
until about 3.4.88, but the Ghost's two entrances (3.4.37 SD and 3.4.88 SD) had been fully restored by 1811 
(Donohue, Dramatic Character, p. 265 n. 59). So far as I can find, the experiment of omitting a visible 
ghost was next tried in a Drury Lane (London) revival, 2 December 1876, when Joseph Knight {Theatrical 
Notes, 1893, p. 162) objected to it, although Irving used some sort of optical illusion in 1875, later replaced 
with a physical actor (Hughes, Irving, p. 107), and still later replaced with another illusion (see p. 78 
below). 
3 See, respectively, G. J. Bell in Jenkin, p. 63, and Siddons, 'Remarks', in Campbell, Life, 11, 30. Siddons 
prefaces her conclusion: 'it is not possible that she [Lady Macbeth] should hear all these ambiguous hints 
about Banquo [in Act 3, Scene 2] without being too well aware that a sudden, lamentable fate awaits him'. 
On whose ghost the on-stage audience imagines, see also Robert F. Willson, Jr, 'Macbeth the player king: 
the banquet scene as frustrated play within the play', Shakespeare Jfahrbuch (Weimar), 114 (1978), 107-14. 
At Stratford in 1955, the Ghost exited (at 3.4.71) by walking between Lord and Lady Macbeth, thereby 
demonstrating that it is invisible to her; see Macbeth Onstage, p. 147. 
4 See Bell in Jenkin, p. 65, and Donohue, 'Kemble and Mrs Siddons in Macbeth', p. 84. W. C. Macready

[68] 

Garrick removed from the staged play some of Davenant's crowd-pleasing witch-
business - they sang, they danced, they flew - the witches were still (in 1833) treated 
primarily as comic rather than as threatening, ominous, or indefinably evil: 

It has been always customary, - heaven only knows why, - to make low comedians act the 
witches, and to dress them like old fishwomen . . . with as due a proportion of petticoats as any 
woman, letting alone witch, might desire, jocose red faces, peaked hats, and broomsticks.1 

If theatrical or cultural conceptions or prejudices stipulate witches who do not some-
how radiate danger or threaten evil, productions will stress Lady Macbeth as instigator 
or promoter of regicide and violence. Alternatively, the less comical the witches, the 
more they appear causative. And the more they seem to be causative agents, the more 
they will be associated with, or represented as, demonic women.2 For more than 150 
years after the Restoration, performances usually represented Lady Macbeth as a 
'bloody-minded virago' or 'female fiend', driving her heroic, noble husband - 'even 
the dupe of his uxoriousness' - to more and more violent acts.3 Hannah Pritchard and 
Sarah Siddons adopted this characterisation, or so those who saw them thought, 
though in retirement Mrs Siddons described the character quite differently.4 

The necessarily twinned possibilities that Lady Macbeth might be a tender, com-
panionate wife, eager to advance her husband's career and to please him, and that 
Macbeth himself is not an heroic dupe and/or a superstitious warrior but the main, 
controlling criminal, arose in the aftermath of the long-dominant Pritchard-Siddons 
tradition.5 By the late 1830s and early 1840s, these ideas entered English-language 
criticism. William Maginn commented: 

evidence is not to despair of theatre history. Rather it serves to rescue it from mere antiquarian accumu-
lation of memorabilia, providing a point of access into cultural history, a means of exploring the dynamic 
created by the interaction of the culture of the past on the culture of the present' (John Webster, The 
Duchess ofMalfi, ed. Kathleen McLuskie and Jennifer Uglow, 1989, p. 3), and for the wider implications 
of performances in the nineteenth century, see e.g. Nina Auerbach's characterisation of the Victorian 
woman-mythos: 'victim and queen, domestic angel and demonic outcast' (Woman and the Demon: The Life 
of a Victorian Myth, 1982, p. 9). 
1 Fanny Kemble, Journal, 18 February 1833, quoted in Sprague, p. 224. Laughable witches - almost always 
men - persisted in the theatre partly because Macbeth provides few opportunities for a company's comic 
specialists. Powerful as modern audiences find his contribution, the Porter may have originated as a 
practical concession to the King's Men's main comic actor (see Appendix 1, p. 264 below). Like the Padua 
promptbook, many post-Restoration productions cut the Porter (probably for his obscenity), but (as 
compensation?) Davenant's ludicrous witches continued well into the nineteenth century, though per-
formances as early as that of Powell and Yates on 20 January 1768 and those of Macklin in the next decade 
presented the witches 'seriously' (Bartholomeusz, pp. 95 and 89). 
2 This latter reflection (not obvious to me), I owe to Christine Krueger; here, theatrical performance 
substantiates Adelman's critical approach to Macbeth. 
3 See, respectively, [Francis Gentleman,] Dramatic Censor, 1, 87 and 89, and William Hazlitt, 'Mr 
[Edmund] Kean's Macbeth', The Champion, 13 November 1814, rpt. in Hazlitt, Dramatic Essays, ed. 
William Archer and Robert W. Lowe, 1895, p. 30. Significant portions of Hazlitt's review are reprinted 
in his Characters of Shakespear's Plays, 1817. Notably, the two 'historical' narratives in Holinshed's 
Chronicles that Shakespeare most relies on, the reigns of King Duff and King Duncan, both contain wives 
who are labelled as ambitious and homicidal. 
4 See her 'Remarks' in Campbell, Life, 11, 10-34; among others, J. Comyns Carr, Macbeth and Lady 
Macbeth, 1889, notes (p. 11) the discrepancy between Siddons's 'Remarks' and her recorded perform-
ances; see also G. J. Bell in Jenkin, passim.

Introduction 

To a mind so disposed, temptation is unnecessary. The thing [the planned regicide] was done 
[in Act i, Scene 3]. Duncan was marked out for murder before the letter [of Act 1, Scene 5] was 
written to Lady Macbeth, and she only followed the thought of her husband. Love for him is in 
fact her guiding passion . . . Bold was her bearing, reckless and defying her tongue, when her 
husband was to be served or saved . . .' 

A few years later, presciently joining textual, critical, and theatrical insight, George 
Fletcher absolves the witches and Lady Macbeth and arraigns Macbeth, who has 'the 
purpose, not suggested to him by any one, but gratuitously and deliberately formed 
within his own breast, of murdering his royal kinsman . . . to usurp his crown'.2 

Fletcher's essay is far more comprehensive, though less eye-catching, than 
Maginn's similarly character-centred, moralistic analysis. Fletcher wrote at a major 
turning-point in conceptions of Macbeth, and he advocates controversial propositions 
that governed criticism and performance well into the twentieth century,3 judging 
Macbeth a 'moral coward' given to ''poetical whining' (pp. 125 and 152). Lady Macbeth 
is a loving wife who 'covets the crown for her husband even more eagerly than he 
desires it for himself and wants to make him 'happier as well as greater' (pp. 119 and 
118); she goes mad when she discovers 'that all she had mistaken in Macbeth for "the 
milk of human kindness" was but mere selfish apprehensiveness' and 'that he is 
capable of no true affection . . . even towards her' (p. 157). The weird sisters are 
neither comedians nor the phantoms of superstition, but 'spirits of darkness' which 
Shakespeare uses to develop 'the evil tendencies inherent in [Macbeth]' (pp. 143 and 
141). Splenetically, Fletcher inveighs against the Davenant-Garrick-Kemble textual 
tradition: cutting the Porter 'destroys . . . the coherence and probability of the inci-
dent' (p. 163); keeping Lady Macbeth off-stage in Act 2, Scene 3, produces 'doubly 
gross improbability' (p. 164);4 suppressing 'the scenes [sic] in Macduff s castle' - the 
murder of Lady Macduff and her son - is 'most injurious of all' (p. 166). 

Fletcher admired Helen Faucit as Constance in King John and proposed her as a 
Lady Macbeth potentially greater than Sarah Siddons. London theatregoers could 
have seen Faucit's Lady Macbeth for one performance with William Charles

reprinted and slightly revised as 'Characters in "Macbeth'" in his Studies of Shakespeare, 1847, pp. 109-
98; quotation from p. 113. Fletcher seems to be the first writer to claim that Macbeth planned usurpation 
prior to the action dramatised in the play. 
3 Character-analysis dominates Fletcher's essay until its final sections on textual 'corruptions' and the 
acting tradition. Fletcher's views of the sisters partly arise from moral anxiety: 'we should not mistake him 
[Shakespeare] as having represented that spirits of darkness are here permitted absolutely and gratuitously 
to seduce his hero from a state of perfectly innocent intention . . . such an error . . . vitiates and debases 
the moral to be drawn from the whole piece. Macbeth does not project the murder of Duncan because of 
his encounter with the weird sisters; the weird sisters encounter him because he has projected the 
murder . . .' (p. 143). Parenthetical references in this paragraph are to Fletcher's Studies in Shakespeare. 
Fletcher's views reappear at least as recently as Byam Shaw's 1955 production; see p. 82 below.

cut Lady Macbeth from this scene: see Davies, Micellanies, 11, 152-3. 

Macbeth 
[70] 

Macready at Drury Lane on 17 April 1843, but reports from Dublin, Paris, and 
Edinburgh allowed Fletcher to add a postscript (21 December 1846): 

her possession of that essentially feminine person . . . together with that energy of intellect and of 
will, which this personation equally demands, - have enabled her to interpret the character with 
a convincing truth of nature and of feeling, more awfully thrilling than the imposing but less 
natural, and therefore less impressive grandeur of Mrs Siddons's representation. Her perform-
ance, in short, would seem to have exhibited . . . not the 'fiend' that Mrs Siddons presented to 
her most ardent admirers - but the far more interesting picture of a naturally generous woman, 
depraved by her very self-devotion to the ambitious purpose of a merely selfish man.1 

Two decades later, Henry Morley confirmed these accounts: Faucit's Lady Macbeth 
is 'essentially feminine, too exclusively gifted with the art of expressing all that is most 
graceful and beautiful in womanhood, to succeed in inspiring anything like awe or 
terror'; at the end of Act 3, Scene 4, she 'collapse[d] into [the] weariness of life-long 
torture'.2 This production included the wholly unShakespearean but not entirely 
Victorian detail of Fleance's silent presence in Act 3, Scene 1, where Faucit's Lady 
Macbeth played 'her fingers about the head of the child Fleance . . . The fingers of the 
woman who has been a mother, and has murder on her soul, wander sadly and tenderly 
over the type of her lost innocence.'3 

Just what this Victorian conception of Lady Macbeth as 'essentially feminine' 
meant, appears from Henry Morley's admiring description of Faucit's Imogen (in 
Cymbeline), 'the purest and most womanly of Shakespeare's women': 

all the qualities that blend to form a womanly perfection, - simple piety, wifely devotion, 
instinctive, unobtrusive modesty, gentle courtesy, moral heroism, with all physical cowardice, 
- no thin ideal, but a very woman, who includes among her virtues aptitude for cookery.4 

Stereotyped and culturally determined as this view of'womanly perfection' is, Morley 
knew it deviated sharply from the Betterton-Barry-Pritchard-Siddons Lady 
Macbeth: Faucit offered 'a most harmonious interpretation of the part according to 
that reading which finds all its womanhood in Lady Macbeth's character'.5 Fletcher 
praised (9 October 1847) Samuel Phelps's then-new Sadler's Wells production for 

1 Fletcher, Studies, p. 198; 'fiend' had been used by Siddons ('Remarks' in Campbell, Life, 11, 19) and her 
admirers. Other English-language critics found Faucit's Lady Macbeth revolutionary: see William 
Carleton to William Stokes, letter, Dublin, 27 November 1846, quoted in Helen Faucit, On Some of 
Shakespeare's Female Characters, enlarged edn, 1891, pp. 401-3, and Theodore Martin, Helena Faucit, 
2nd edn, 1900, pp. 159-60 (an anecdote not substantiated by 'Christopher North' [i.e. John Wilson], 'Dies 
Boréales. No. V, Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine 66 (November 1849), 620-54). 
2 Henry Morley, The Journal of a London Playgoer, from 1851 to 1866, 1866, pp. 350 and 353, discussing a 
Faucit-Samuel Phelps Drury Lane performance, 3 December 1864. Carol J. Carlisle, 'Helen Faucit's 
Lady Macbeth', S.St. 16 (1983), 205-33, reprints many contemporary criticisms with a scene-by-scene 
reconstruction of Faucit's performance; my account is independent of Carlisle's and sometimes disagrees 
with it. 
3 Morley, pp. 352-3. Faucit apparently adopted the gesture from Macready (see Downer, p. 329). Sprague 
(pp. 247-8) reports that Kemble brought on Fleance in this scene, as did Herbert Beerbohm Tree (see 
Gordon Crosse, Shakespearean Playgoing, I8QO-IÇ52, 
1953, p. 39), and Fleance appeared in 3.1 as 
recently as Byam Shaw's 1955 Stratford production (Macbeth Onstage, p. 118) and Roman Polanski's film 
of Macbeth (1971), where Macbeth tweaks Fleance's cheek at this moment. Late in her career, Faucit 
seems to have been the first English actress since before Garrick's time to appear in Act 2, Scene 3 
(Carlisle, 'Helen Faucit's Lady Macbeth', pp. 218-19), and see headnote to Act 2, Scene 3.

Introduction 

'dismissing in toto the operatic insertions, and restoring the suppressed characters, 
scenes, and speeches', though Fletcher still grumbled over Banquo's visible ghost and 
thought 'The "weird sisters," though divested in great part of their former grossness 
by Mr Phelps's treatment, still need a little more refining.'1 

Theatre dotes on old tradition and new fashion. While some audiences, actors, and 
critics continued to espouse earlier ideas, theatrical and critical perception of the 
witches gradually changed in concert with Faucit's 'new', 'feminine' Lady Macbeth 
and the Lady's newly independent, criminal and/or cowardly husband. By the middle 
of the nineteenth century, William Wetmore Story's observations had become fairly 
conventional: Lady Macbeth, 'having committed one crime, dies of remorse'; 
Macbeth 'is a thorough hypocrite' and 'a victim of superstitious fears, and a mere 
coward'; 'The witches are a projection of his [Macbeth's] own desires and super-
stitions. They . . . prophes[y] in response to his own desires' and are therefore neither 
instigators nor determinants of his behaviour.2 

Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century critics often compared Richard III with 
Macbeth - the two were the most notable Shakespearean villain-heroes - and 
Edmund Kean, the tragic actor whose brief career spanned the end of Kemble's and 
the beginning of Macready's, was an unsurpassable Richard III, but a relatively weak 
Macbeth, 'deficient in the poetry of the character'.3 Macready, unremittingly competi-
tive and relentlessly self-critical, probably spoke true when he complained that 'a 
newspaper . . . gave me very moderate praise for Macbeth, observing that though 
good, it was not so good as Kean's, which was a total failure'.4 

Macready was one of the few to criticise Helen Faucit, 'whom I do not like; she 
wants heart';5 he was also the earliest and finest Macbeth to play opposite her Lady 
Macbeth, and he generously recognised her new interpretation: 

Rehearsed Macbeth; was very much struck with Miss Faucit's rehearsal of Lady Macbeth, 
which surprised and gratified me very much. Acted [that night] Macbeth as well as my harassed 
mind and worn-down body would let me. Called for [by the audience] and well received. Would 
have taken on [stage, for a curtain call] Miss Faucit, but she [had taken off her costume] 
. . . Spoke . . . afterwards . . . with her about her acting, which was remarkably good.6 

1 Fletcher, Studies, p. 383. Specifically, Phelps 'dropped the music and the interpolated words, restored 
Lady Macduff and her son, killed Macbeth off-stage and brought on his head on a pole'; see Muriel St 
Clare Byrne, 'Fifty years of Shakespearian production: 1898-1948', S.Sur. 2 (1949), 2.

5; Donohue, Dramatic Character, chapter 8. The Richard Ill-Macbeth comparison is so ingrained that

to Richard III.

Edinburgh and Paris. Faucit's later Macbeth, Samuel Phelps, a manager justly honoured for recovering 

Macbeth 
[72} 

Macready compromised between the 'old' heroic Macbeth and the 'new' weak but 
criminal Macbeth.1 One 'judicious and effective innovation' was his 'air of bewildered 
agitation upon coming on the stage [in Act 1, Scene 5, presumably] after the interview 
with the weird sisters', and George Bell, an experienced playgoer, describes Macbeth 
facing Banquo's Ghost on its second appearance: 

Macready plays this well. Even Kemble chid and scolded the ghost out! and rose in vehemence 
and courage as he went on. Macready began in the vehemence of despair, but, overcome by 
terror as he continued to gaze on the apparition, dropped his voice lower and lower till he 
became tremulous and inarticulate, and at last uttering a subdued cry of mortal agony and 
horror, he suddenly cast his mantle over his face, and sank back almost lifeless on his seat.2 

It is noticeable that Macready, the unnerved and superstitious victim, was quite ready 
to use his hero's truncheon on other actors or impertinent members of the audience 
(see illustration 14).3 

Macready, having played opposite Faucit's 'new' Lady Macbeth, was also partner 
to one of his era's most violent (or 'most imperial')4 Lady Macbeths, the American 
Charlotte Cushman, whose 

style of acting, while it lacked imagination, possessed in a remarkable degree the elements of 
force . . . [s]he was intensely prosaic, definitely practical, and hence her perfect identity 
with . . . the materialism of Lady Macbeth . . . [Cushman exhibited] the coarse features and 
harsh voice of the heroine of a melodrama . . . Thus is one of Shakespeare's grandest dramatic 
conceptions dragged down to the lowest level of a mere sensational exhibition.5 

After his first performance with Cushman in Boston, Macready commented: 'Miss 
Cushman . . . interested me much. She has to learn her art, but she showed mind and 
sympathy with me; a novelty so refreshing to me on the stage.'6 Macready grew more 
critical of Cushman, especially after her first, highly successful visit to England, but 
she learned from him and seems to have repeated some of his technique, and even in 
these early performances an English observer could consciously compare the two: 

Shakespeare's texts theatrically, was also, Faucit said, a 'very inadequate successor' to Macready, who 
himself regarded Phelps as an actor who was 'afraid to play the first and averse to take the second 
characters'. See Faucit, Shakespeare's Female Characters, p. 234, and Macready, Diaries, 1, 427. 
1 See G. H. Lewes, On Actors and the Art of Acting, Leipzig, 1875 (not the '2nd edn' of London, also 1875), 
pp. 46-7: 'nothing could have been less heroic than his [Macready's] presentation of the great criminal. 
He [Macready] was fretful and impatient under the taunts and provocations of his wife; he was ignoble 
under the terrors of remorse; he stole into the sleeping-chamber of Duncan [2.2] like a man going to 
purloin a purse, not like a warrior going to snatch a crown.'

58. Downer, pp. 318-38, reconstructs Macready's Macbeth, with its 'elaborate scenery and crowds of well-
drilled supers' (Crosse, p. 35).

Macbeth 
[74] 

with this great and cultivated artist she held her own. She had not had his experience, but she 
had genius. There were times when she more than rivalled him; when in truth she made him 
play second ... I have seen her throw such energy, physical and mental, into her performance, 
as to weaken for the time the impression of Mr Macready's magnificent acting.1 

Macready seems to have been proudest of his performance in the fifth act (after Lady 
Macbeth is finally off the stage!), where he emphasised both 'pathos' and a kind of 
desperate physical heroism.2 

Macbeth is not the only Shakespearean play to have provoked riots, but it has 
occasioned several, including the most deadly one of all. Chance or commercial 
shrewdness may explain why Kemble chose Macbeth for the first night (18 September 
1809) when new prices were demanded for many places in the rebuilt Covent Garden 
Theatre: the 'O. P.' ('Old Price') disturbances ensued for seventy days. Earlier, in 
October 1773, Charles Macklin, an actor then in his seventies and famed for comedy 
and for an innovative Shylock, had played Macbeth at Covent Garden. Macklin's 
enemies, perhaps a pro-Garrick group, and the partisans of 'Gentleman' Smith (the 
actor of Macbeth whom Macklin had displaced) objected and hired a claque who 
fomented another destructive but non-fatal riot at a performance of The Merchant of 
Venice (18 November 1773).3 If Charlotte Cushman was a throwback to earlier ideas of 
Lady Macbeth, her countryman Edwin Forrest, who also had a successful career in 
England, was 'the robust warrior'4 Macbeth in the older mould. In New York in 1849, 
he and Macready (who was appearing at the Astor Place Opera House) offered two 
directly competing interpretations, and the ensuing public disagreements, fuelled by 
the actors' well-publicised antagonism and by jingoistic, xenophobic, and dimly 'patri-
otic' energies, produced the 'Astor Place riot' in which twenty or more people died (10 
May 1849).5 

Although Helen Faucit's 'new' Lady Macbeth had been anticipated in Germany,6 

the older conception of the part remained, and remains today, a living theatrical 
possibility. In 1857, Adelaide Ristori (illustration 15), then Italy's greatest tragedienne

and first international star, and later to be mentioned by George Eliot and James Joyce, 
travelled to London with Macbetto, an Italian verse-adaptation by Giulio Carcano 
which Verdi used as a basis for his opera, Macbeth.1 Ristori gave a traditional, Siddons-
like performance, albeit underplayed and nuanced so that critics were struck by her 
subtle facial and postural acting and the way she ignored traditional actor's 'points': 

Madame Ristori conceives Lady Macbeth as a woman who pens up her emotions, who is 
watchful, self-contained, who fights against compunctious visitings of nature without letting a 
stir be seen ... [In Act i, Scene 6,] [t]here is ... a false expression playing faintly now and then 
across her face . . . When at the close [of Act i, Scene 7] he [Macbeth], for the first time, speaks 
as an accomplice, her face brightens with exultation . . . and . . . she repeats the . . . exit [of Act 
1, Scene 5].2 

Having 'hurried over' Lady Macbeth's admission, 'Had he not resembled / My father 
as he slept, I had done't' (2.2.12-13), Ristori reacted emotionally to Macbeth's de-
scription of Duncan's body (2.3.104-7): 'and then the point is made that ninety-nine 
actresses in a hundred would assuredly have tried to make before'.3 

Ristori performed Lady Macbeth in English in London (Drury Lane, 3 July 1882) 
and, later, in New York and Philadelphia with Edwin Booth, but she made her earliest 
impression supported 'feebly enough' by a cast speaking Italian before an English 
audience (who could refer, like some modern opera audiences, to a parallel-text 
Italian-English libretto).4 While that libretto by Carcano followed the Folio fairly 
closely, it was also severely cut: all of Lady Macbeth's scenes are present except Act 3, 
Scene 1; only the first seven lines of Act 3, Scene 2, remain. The libretto ends barely 
a page after Lady Macbeth's final appearance in Act 5, Scene i.s 

In this emphasis upon Lady Macbeth, in its consequent diminution of her hus-
band's part, as well as in many other cuts and shifts of emphasis, the Ristori version 
echoes the greatest adaptation of Macbeth and the only one in which we may today

Introduction 

have a sense of the play's nineteenth-century, and perhaps earlier, form and appeal: 
Giuseppi Verdi's Macbeth. '[T]he first Italian opera to make a real attempt to be 
Shakespearean', Verdi's Macbeth is not his finest operatic response to 'a favorite poet 
of mine, whom I have had in my hands from earliest youth, and whom I read and 
reread constantly' - Verdi's Otello and Falstaff are undeniably greater and usually 
more beautiful - but '[staging] ideas from London, where this tragedy has been 
produced continually for over 200 years' influenced his first Macbeth (1847), and Verdi 
apparently knew Macready's London performance and, certainly, Ristori's later ones, 
and they influenced the revised version (Paris, 1865).1 I n Verdi's opera, along with the 
intensification of Lady Macbeth there went an immediately controversial 
treatment of the witches and other supernatural or 'grotesque' material, redolent of 
Victorian non-musical stagings.2 

After W. C. Macready, only two Victorian-Edwardian English actor-managers, Sir 
Henry Irving (the first theatre knight) and Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree (the second), 
contributed significantly to views of Macbeth. As a young actor, Irving had been 
'instructed' by Charlotte Cushman,3 and in 1875 he offered a controversial, anti-
Cushman interpretation when Kate Bateman was an undistinguished Lady Macbeth. 
Though his Lyceum Theatre became 'a national institution', this first Macbeth was 
instantly attacked: 'the irresolution' Macbeth 'displays in the earlier scenes' of the 
play arises from 'personal fear', and Irving's Macbeth is a 'cowardly, remorseless 
villain . . . from the very first'.4 In 1888 Irving played Macbeth again, in a fresh 
interpretation, with Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth,5 and Percy Fitzgerald reviewed the 
new production more positively: 'The Scotch chieftain and his lady are shown, not 
simply as mere human, but almost creatures of necessity, subservient to the pressure 
of a weak, nerveless nature in the one case, and of a devoted conjugal affection in the 
other.'6 Some critical views changed between 1875 ana" 1888, and part of the reason 
must be the change from Kate Bateman to Ellen Terry, who had already established 
a reputation as 'feminine' and 'gentle' and claims in her diary that 'Those who don't 
like me in it [Macbeth] are those who don't want, and don't like to read it fresh from 
Shakespeare, and who hold by the "fiend" reading of the character.'7 

Terry had no doubts about Irving's choices: 

1 See, respectively, the following in Rosen and Porter: William Weaver (p. 147); Verdi to Léon Escudier, 
28 April 1865 (p. 144); Verdi to Alessandro Lanari, 22 December 1846 (p. 27), and (on later stagings) 
Verdi to Escudier, 23 January 1865 (p. 90); Weaver (p. 144, on Verdi and Macready); Verdi to Escudier,

Macbeth, see Jonas Barish, 'Madness, hallucination, and sleepwalking', ibid., pp. 149-55. 
3 Leach, Bright Particular Star, p. 267. 
4 See Crosse, p. 18, and Sheridan Knorvles ' Conception, p. 7. The anonymous author goes on to complain that 
Irving's Macbeth 'has no genuine conscientious scruples. He never really hesitates in his purpose, but 
simply lacks the pluck or the nerve necessary for its execution. Lady Macbeth is the opposite of all this 
- the man irresolute and weak, the wife strong and determined' (p. 15).

Macbeth 
[78} 

His view of 'Macbeth,' though attacked and derided and put to shame in many quarters, is as 
clear to me as the sunlight itself. To me it seems as stupid to quarrel with the conception as to 
deny the nose on one's face. But the carrying out of the conception was unequal. Henry's 
imagination was sometimes his worst enemy.1 

All the old arguments over the relative strengths and relative heroisms of Lord and 
Lady Macbeth returned. 'The reading of the character [Macbeth] is robbed of one of 
its most effective dramatic elements in the loss of the contrast between a noble and 
ignoble side of Macbeth's nature'; Ellen Terry's performance, though beautiful, is 'the 
whitewashing of Lady Macbeth'.2 Twenty years after she first played Lady Macbeth, 
Terry rebutted this view of Irving's Macbeth when she famously recalled him 'in the 
last act after the battle when he looked like a great famished wolf, weak with the 
weakness of a giant exhausted, spent as one whose exertions have been ten times as 
great as those of commoner men of rougher fibre and coarser strength'.3 

After Macready withdrew from the stage, the nineteenth-century theatre saw in-
creasingly tender, 'feminine', 'wifely' Lady Macbeths and increasingly criminal and 
violent Macbeths, in no small part because the play's spectacle was shifted from comic 
and mechanically equipped witches to witches, no less spectacular and no less 
equipped, but now having supernatural and demonic mystery. Whatever the com-
plaints about Irving's cowardly Macbeth or Terry's too tenderly beautiful Lady 
Macbeth, critics agreed on the power of the witches in their performances: 

they are always enveloped in awe-inspiring gloom . . . or by . . . ruddy glow . . . even the nil 
admirari materialist spectator of today is more inclined to shudder than to sneer.4 

And Irving found, when he took his Macbeth to the United States in 1895, a 'solution' 
to the problem of Banquo's Ghost - 'a greenish light shining on an empty stool' - that 
satisfied his audience.5 

Herbert Beerbohm Tree, 'rising into the second place [after Irving] as a producer of 
Shakespeare'6 on the London stage, could have known A. C. Bradley's influential 
critical account (1904) of Macbeth. Tree is usually remembered for his elaborate and 
highly detailed illusionistic productions, in which he raised 'illustrative' Shakespeare 
to new and eventually self-defeating heights, taking hints from the text to produce 
finical, time-consuming, and unscripted tableaux vivants.1 Yet Ellen Terry's son,

extensively and gratefully.

December 1888, quoted in W. Moelwyn Merchant, Shakespeare and the Artist, 1959, p. 139), Irving 
accepted Holinshed's chronology and played Macbeth as an old man in Act 5; the Byam Shaw production 
(Stratford, 1955) made the same choice (see p. 80 below, n. 3).

Ball, Shakespeare on Silent Film, 1968, pp. 229-35, amusingly recounts how London's West End met 
Hollywood. 

[79] 
Introduction 

Edward Gordon Craig, who played Malcolm in Irving's tours in the 1890s and was 
himself an innovative artist ahead of his time, originally designed (1908) the sets for 
what became Tree's 1911 Macbeth.1 Those designs never reached the stage, but they 
deeply influenced the production, helping to make it at least semi-expressionistic and 
to thrust the audience into an experience of the text as if from Macbeth's point of view: 
'Our attempt. . . will be to create . . . that awe-inspiring atmosphere which is sug-
gested by the poet.'2 

Edward Gordon Craig, one hopes, had little to do with Tree's version of Act 1, 
Scene 7, where the dialogue 'was performed with the [audible accompaniment] . . . of 
Duncan and the court at dinner', or with Duncan's and his followers' silent appear-
ance at the end of the scene, 'to give a blessing to his hosts and their house', followed 
by the cackling re-entrance of the witches.3 (Off-stage sounds of revelry here have 
since become commonplace.) Tree's 'Cauldron scene' (Shakespeare's Act 4, Scene 1), 
however, recalls productions stretching back to Kemble and before; the witches, 
omnipresent if unShakespearean witnesses throughout the play, now multiply into a 
demonic, ghostly chorus surrounding this scene.4 Weak, conventional, or unmemor-
able as Tree's performance as Macbeth may have been - few contemporary accounts 
even mention his Lady - his production did anticipate such theatrically important 
versions as Theodore Komisarjevsky's 1933 Stratford production, where the audience 
shared Macbeth's mental experience, including an Act 4, Scene 1, in which Macbeth 
spoke the Apparitions' prophecies during a dream-sequence.5 

Following Irving's and Tree's, there are no enduringly important English-language 
stagings of Macbeth until Glen Byam Shaw's 1955 production at Stratford and Trevor 
Nunn's 1976-8 productions at Stratford and in London.6 Byam Shaw's production, 
explicitly 'starring' Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh (illustration 16), was much 
anticipated and people agreed that, once the 'strangeness' of the 'unfamiliar stresses' 
that Olivier gave the verse had worn off, it was 'much the best performance of the part

witch chorus's 'positively . . . last appearance' (Byrne, p. 2).

6 This sentence uncharitably passes over many significant productions. For instance, F. R. Benson's early-
twentieth-century performances (see Crosse, p. 31); Barry Jackson's production (London, 1928), the first 
in modern dress, which also gave 'blasted heath' and 'bloody man' their modern British slang rather than 
their Jacobean resonances (see, in general, Michael Mullin, ''Macbeth in modern dress: Royal Court 
Theatre, 1928', Theatre Journal 30 (1978), 176-85); Komisarjevsky's production (Stratford, 1933), dis-
cussed above; Donald Wolfit's performances (see e.g. Crosse, p. 147); not to mention Christopher 
Plummer's widely admired performance (Stratford, Ontario, 1962; see Leiter, p. 375), or Maggie Smith's 
in the same place, 1978 (see Leiter, p. 385), or the Simone Signoret-Alec Guinness production (directed 
by William Gaskill, Royal Court, London, 1966), or Glenda Jackson's fascinating and Plummer's lamen-
table performances (New York and elsewhere in North America, 1988). Richard Eyre's otherwise undis-
tinguished Royal National Theatre, London, production (1993) offered a fine Macduff (James 
Laurenson). For the remarkable changes in British Shakespearean productions from the mid nineteenth 
century to the mid twentieth, see Byrne and Crosse, passim. 

Macbeth 
[80] 

16 Act 2, Scene 3, in Glen Byam Shaw's 1955 Stratford Memorial Theatre production. Macbeth 
(Laurence Olivier) attends the fainting Lady Macbeth (Vivien Leigh) 

in our time', according to J. C. Trewin, who went on to say that it might even be 'the 
best since William Charles Macready's' (which Trewin could not possibly have seen); 
Olivier's 'interpretation of Macbeth met with the kind of consensus of approval among 
critics given in earlier years to players like Garrick and Mrs Siddons'.1 Leigh's 'frail, 
porcelain beauty' (much admired) and her 'kind of coldness, even hardness' (much 
criticised) did not satisfy those who expected Siddons-like domination, though one 
critic praised her for showing 'that Macbeth and his Lady were lovers before they were 
criminals'.2 Leigh's performance of Act 5, Scene 1, when, grey-haired and staring, she 
alternated 'senile and childish tones', was also effective.3 

1 See George Scott, Truth 155 (17 June 1955), p. 770; J. C. Trewin, Birmingham Post, 15 June 1955 (second 
notice); Macbeth Onstage, p. [249], citing Richard David, 'The tragic curve', S.Sur. 9 (1956), 122-31, 
where the remark does not appear. Macbeth Onstage, p. 11 n. 3, lists 48 periodical reviews of the 
production. Byam Shaw's text closely paralleled Henry Irving's (see Hughes, Irving, p. 91). 
2 See, respectively: Daily Mail, 8 June 1955; Patrick Gibbs, Daily Telegraph, 8 June 1955; Ivor Brown, 
Drama, Autumn 1955, p. 34. Leigh's performance of Lady Macbeth, like Ann Todd's (Old Vic, 
London, 1954, directed by Michael Benthall; see also David, 'Tragic curve') probably suffered from 
critics' assumptions or preconceptions based on the actress's cinematic appearances, especially in non-
Shakespearean roles; see, generally, Byrne, p. 11. 
3 Patrick Gibbs, Daily Telegraph, 8 June 1955. Here Byam Shaw and Leigh duplicated the 1888 Irving-
Terry production, where, more or less following Holinshed's account, many years were supposed to have 
passed between the end of the Folio's Act 3 and the beginning of its Act 5; see Hughes, Irving, pp. 109 and 
112. 

[Si] 
Introduction 

Maxine Audley (Lady Macduff), one of the few actors praised for a supporting 
performance here,1 identifies a pattern that recalls many earlier productions: 

what I thought was so clever of Olivier was to realize that the part of Macbeth is one long build 
up to the end . . . it's a long, straight line upwards, ending with the great fight. . . When he 
comes to his wife [in 1.5], she's up, she goes completely the other way. I always feel very strongly 
he's at his lowest ebb and she's absolutely at her peak and they completely change over. I think 
they cross at the end of the Banquet Scene. She's geared herself and steeled herself to get 
through this terrific ordeal, and by the time . . . [the guests have] all gone, she has already gone. 
She's finished. 

And indeed Byam Shaw directed that Leigh 'sinks down on her knees leaning against 
Kings [sic] throne' before she manages to exit when Olivier, renewed, summoned her, 
'Come, we'll to sleep . . .'2 This pattern necessarily meant that Olivier's Macbeth 
began quietly, with, for example, only a 'slight start' when all-hailed as 'king here-
after'; critics complained about this restraint, which extended until the discovery of 
Duncan's murder, the first great 'explosion' of this production, followed by two later 
peaks in the banquet scene and the final duel.3 Byam Shaw exploited the actor's great 
physical presence and gymnastic agility in these later climaxes. When the Ghost re-
entered Act 3, Scene 4, upstage and between two royal thrones, immediately after 
Macbeth's 'Would he were here', Olivier initially recoiled, but then, pushing Lady 
Macbeth and her excuses aside ('Think of this, good peers, / But as a thing of 
custom'), Olivier jumped upon the banqueting table in a great swirl of robes and 
desperate bravery.4 

Byam Shaw's directorial notes stress how much he sought the audience's admira-
tion for Macbeth and Lady Macbeth: 

After he has committed the crime . . . all that is bad in his character bursts out. . . but the 
magnificence & courage of his nature remain till the end. He never becomes a brutish villain like 
Iago [in Othello] or Aaron [in Titus Andronicus]. 

Her loyalty to her husband is magnificent. The way she behaves in the banquet scene is beyond 
praise. In spite of her complete lack of compassion & goodness of heart one cannot but have the 
greatest admiration for her courage & loyalty.5 

Byam Shaw's comment on Lady Macbeth has a Victorian flavour, and in performance 
Vivien Leigh made a relatively weak and certainly a subordinate impression, but 
Olivier managed to fascinate, rather than repel, the audience, or at least the critics, 
right through the final, dangerously violent battle with Macduff. This concentration

2 Macbeth Onstage, pp. [251] and 153. In the Irving-Terry production Macbeth and Lady Macbeth 
'crossed' (i.e. their respective strengths changed) at the beginning of Shakespeare's Act 3 (Hughes, Irving, 
p. 105) as they did in the 1996 Stratford production directed by Tim Albery with Brid Brennan and Roger 
Allam. 
3 See, respectively: Macbeth Onstage, pp. 43 and [249], and Milton Shulman's famous remark, 'restraint run 
amok' (Evening Standard, 8 June 1955). 
4 For the Ghost's and Macbeth's action, see Macbeth Onstage, p. 149; most contemporary critics praised 
Olivier's extraordinary effects here. 
5 Macbeth Onstage, pp. 152-3. Commenting on Act 1, Scene 5, Shaw wrote: 'She has . . . an extraordinary 
intensity of purpose. She adores her husband. Her ambition for him is beyond everything' (ibid., p. 59). 

Macbeth 
[82] 

on flawed heroism meant in turn that the witches 'are certainly not the Fates. If we felt 
that Macbeth was, through them, fated to murder the King it would completely 
destroy the tragedy of the story'; yet, in keeping with Macbeth's paradoxical 'heroism', 
the witches 'should be terrible & yet strangely wonderful - because anything evil is, 
always, fascinating & wonderful in some way . . . They must have tragic stature.'1 At 
the first rehearsal, Shaw spoke frequently of hell, damnation, and the devil, and 
generalised still further, 'this is the most moral play, & is the strongest possible 
warning against evil & sin'.2 

Only one other English-language staging since 1945 merits comparison with the 
1955 Stratford production, and it could not be more different. Following an unsuc-
cessful Christian-demonic production of Macbeth with Helen Mirren (Lady Macbeth) 
and Nicol Williamson (Macbeth), where 'sex [was] the essence o f the Macbeths' 
'tragedy' (Stratford and London, 1974-5),3 Trevor Nunn directed Judi Dench (Lady 
Macbeth) and Ian McKellen (Macbeth) in a sternly 'ensemble', not 'star', production 
(1976-8), first at The Other Place (Stratford), later in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, later at 
the RSC's main house (also Stratford), and still later at the Warehouse, then a Royal 
Shakespeare Company London venue. Unlike most English-language productions 
since 1660, this one deployed a small cast, fourteen persons according to Nunn, but 
varying slightly from year to year.4 Nunn's production expressed the demonic freshly 
and seriously, making witchcraft vital in a way Orson Welles's 'voodoo' Macbeth (New 
York, 1936) did not and replacing Welles's more than faintly racist view with an 
anthropologically sophisticated version.5 These witches have true and complete pow-
ers. They cannot be distanced or ignored as 'primitive' or 'other'. They are at once 
psychologically explicable and irrational. 
A strongly marked chalk circle circumscribed the playing space (barely visible at the 
top of illustration 17), and the audience saw a rehearsal studio rather than a formal 
stage: actors not needed for the moment sat or stood circumferentially, sometimes 
reacting to the events within the circled 'acting' space, sometimes simply awaiting 
their moments to perform.6 Macbeth (McKellen) always traversed the circle anti-
clockwise or 'widdershins' - a reversal traditionally thought of as Satanic or unlucky 
- whereas other characters moved in a 'moral' or 'virtuous' clockwise way to their 
places and eventually their exits.7 Nunn's production made no attempt at realistic

Cushman, The Observer, 12 September 1976, put the cast he saw at sixteen. 
5 Nunn's version here, so different from the generally Christian interpretation he earlier adopted (Strat-
ford, 1974), may owe something to Charles Marowitz's radical adaptation (Wiesbaden, May 1969; see next 
note). 
6 Charles Marowitz's A Macbeth (1971), with a cast of eleven, including three Macbeths (representing 'the 
Timorous, the Ambitious, the Nefarious'), probably influenced this and other elements (e.g. the demon-
ism permeating the cast) in Nunn's production. See 'Exercises to A Macbeth [sic\ in The Marowitz

Introduction 

17 Act 4, Scene 1, in Trevor Nunn's 1976-8 RSC production. The sisters (Marie Kean, Judith Harte, 
Susan Dury) present figures of the Apparitions to a drugged, hallucinating Macbeth (Ian McKellen). A 
strongly marked black circle circumscribes the playing space, and the audience sees a rehearsal studio rather 
than a formal stage 

illusion; when theatrical effects were needed, the audience saw how those effects -
thunder, lightning - came about. A great 'thunder-sheet' was the stage's backdrop, 
and when thunder was needed, the audience saw it made. Paradoxically, the sensation 
was the reverse of artificial. Seeing sounds and lightning made, the audience under-
stood they were not 'natural' but created, created - violently and with an absolute evil 

Macbeth 
[84]

- by forces not theatrical but far beyond the theatre or indeed Shakespeare. These
effects were not 'effects', but something, some things, happening outside human
comprehension and beyond human explanation.
In a further paradox, this extraordinary production did not relieve Macbeth and
Lady Macbeth of responsibility. They discussed, undertook, consciously chose to
perform terrible acts, but while they did so from calculated ambition they were also
seen to be environed by forces which no audience could understand and no character
resist. They were at once responsible and unknowing, in a powerful and ultimately
tragic fashion. And still, the acts were committed. In a way quite beyond the reach of
rational explanation, but a way also full of theatrical energy and emotional power,
Nunn's production made Macbeth and Lady Macbeth simultaneously guilty agents
and victims.
Theatrical tradition is a powerful drug, narcotic or ecstatic. Henry Irving having
once hoisted Macbeth's sword onto his shoulder in 1888, John Gielgud would con-
sciously imitate him in 1930,1 and more than a century after Irving and more than half
a century after Gielgud, so would Alan Howard (Royal National Theatre, London,
1993). Less happily, Davenant's spectacle and Davenant's witches, however trans-
mogrified, always trivialising and intrusive, long plagued even the most distinguished
performances: Garrick—Pritchard, Kemble-Siddons, Macready-Faucit. Sometimes
leading, sometimes following theatrical practice, literary critics have been likewise
bemused, likewise puzzled. And always the simplest questions have proved the hard-
est to answer in both performance and criticism.

FURTHER VARIATIONS: KUROSAWA, POLANSKI, NINAGAWA
There have been two distinguished cinematic versions of Macbeth, one a medieval
Japanese adaptation, Kumonosu-ju (Throne of Blood in English, but more accurately
and revealingly, The Castle of the Spider's Web) directed by Akira Kurosawa (1957), the
other a film much closer to Shakespeare's text, Macbeth, directed by Roman Polanski
(1971).2 The third 'variation' I consider here is Yukio Ninagawa's theatrical produc-
tion, also placed in a feudal Japanese milieu.

1 See John Gielgud, Early Stages, 1939, p. 168, on his performance in the 1930 Harcourt Williams
production at the Old Vic (London), and Sprague, p. 230.
2 In Kurosawa's film, Toshiro Mifune plays Macbeth and Isuzu Yamada, Lady Macbeth; in Polanski's, the
roles were taken by two actors untraditionally young for the parts, Jon Finch and Francesca Annis. Other
notable cinematic and television versions include: Orson Welles's Macbeth (1948), based on Welles's
earlier theatrical production mentioned above; Joe Macbeth (1955; directed by Ken Hughes with Paul
Douglas as Macbeth and Ruth Roman as Lady Macbeth); the later of two (1954, i960) Maurice Evans-
Judith Anderson Hallmark Hall of Fame television versions (i960, directed by George Schaefer); the Eric
Porter-Janet Suzman Macbeth (1970, BBC TV, directed by John Gorrie); the Thames Television version
(directed by Philip Casson, 1978) of the Judi Dench-Ian McKellen RSC theatrical production discussed
above (for staged versus televised versions, see Michael Mullin, 'Stage and screen: the Trevor Nunn
Macbeth\ ££) 38 (1987), 350-9); the Nicol Williamson-Jane Lapotaire television production in the BBC
'The Shakespeare Plays' series (1982, directed by Jack Gold); Men of Respect, 'Written and directed by
William Reilly adapted from the "Tragedy of Macbeth" by William Shakespeare' (Columbia Pictures,
1990). For further details of, and a summary of critical reaction and printed responses to, all but the last,
see Rothwell and Melzer, pp. 155 ff. Both Joe Macbeth and Men of Respect transpose Shakespeare's plot
and characters into criminal environments roughly contemporary with the making of the two films

[85] 
Introduction

Kurosawa's subtle, learned adaptation of Macbeth is far too complex for summary,
and I do not mention many of the film's extraordinary effects.1 To the dismay of many
critics, Throne of Blood does not use Shakespeare's text, often replacing the most
verbally complex moments with tiny, silent gestures and absences of movement. The
film's visual imagery exploits the play's metaphors (of birds and their cries, for
example, of a horse wildly uncontrolled, of darkness and light), but its narrative
deletes entirely Shakespeare's Malcolm and related matters, including the 'English
Scene' (Act 4, Scene 3) and the Porter (conversing soldiers fill some of the expository
gaps). Captain Washizu (the figure equivalent to Macbeth) and Captain Miki (the
figure equivalent to Banquo) encounter a single androgynous witch, spinning thread
like a Greco-Roman Fate, in the 'Cobweb Forest' near the 'Cobweb Castle' all seek to
control, and Washizu much later returns to the witch and her/his environment to hear
a prophecy - Washizu will reign until the Cobweb Forest moves - recalling the Third
Apparition's prediction in Macbeth Act 4, Scene 1. Toshiro Mifune (Washizu) offers
a superb performance, combining vocal range with superlative physical acting; he is
matched (at least for a western audience) by Isuzu Yamada (Lady Asaji, Washizu's
wife and the figure equivalent to Lady Macbeth). She persuades Washizu to murder
Tsuzuki (the film's equivalent to Duncan) by voicing the film's emphatic view of
human submission to fate and prophecy when she points out that Tsuzuki 'killed his
own master to become what he is now'2 (an observation true to Holinshed's narrative
of Scottish history), and she persuades Washizu to persevere in killing Miki/Banquo
and Yoshiteru/Fleance by telling him 'I am with child' when Washizu/Macbeth seeks
to fulfil the witch's prophecy (and avoid any dire consequences) by appointing
Yoshiteru/Fleance his heir. In a creative revision of Macbeth, Kurosawa finds the
stillborn child of Asaji a source of the couple's political collapse and part of her
subsequent madness. Kurosawa's film echoes Shakespeare's ghostly banquet (Act 3,
Scene 4), but places the Murderer's announcement of Miki's death and Yoshiteru's
survival after (not before, as in Macbeth) the gathered nobles have departed. Washizu

(compare Kurosawa's similar translation to a period in Japanese history more-or-less analogous to
medieval Scotland and Jacobean England, when the Duncan figure is as violently regicidal as the Macbeth
figure). In Men of Respect, for example, Macbeth becomes 'Mike Battaglia [= Battle]' (John Turturro),
Lady Macbeth, 'Ruth' (Katherine Borowitz), and Duncan, 'Charlie D'Amico [= Friend]' (Rod Steiger);
here, the conflict lies among an entirely criminal or near-criminal cast, and D'Amico (Duncan) is just
another crime-boss to be toppled. Thus, the characters equivalent to Lady Macduff and her son die in a
car-bombing while the husband is detained by a chance telephone call; the witches are a palm-reader/
fortune-teller/tealeaf-reader and her husband (compare 'Rosie' in Joe Macbeth and see Rothwell and
Melzer, p. 155); the Lady Macbeth character worries about cleanliness and walks madly around the
restaurant the couple manage as a 'front' for their criminal activities, and she later commits suicide.
Birnam Wood disappears, and the Shakespearean prophecy is changed to 'until the stars fall', which they
do in a fireworks show.
1 See James Goodwin, Akira Kurosawa and Intertextual Cinema, 1994, pp. 169-91, for a basic analysis of the
relations between Shakespeare's play and Kurosawa's film. Useful studies of Kurosawa's film (with
references to the substantial number of other critical works) are: Anthony Davies, Filming Shakespeare's
Plays, 1988, pp. 152-66, and Peter S. Donaldson, Shakespearean Films/Shakespearean Directors, 1990, pp.
71-91.
2 English quotations from the film's dialogue cite the sub-titles, translated by Donald Richie, of the
vidéocassette (see Goodwin, p. 242 n. 11). For an English translation of the script by Hisae Niki, see Akira
Kurosawa, 'Seven Samurai' and Other Screenplays, 1992.

Macbeth 
[86]

then kills the Murderer. Just as Kurosawa's later Ran (1985) combines Shakespeare's
King Lear with Macbeth, Throne of Blood alludes momentarily to Hamlet when a Noh-
like poet-dancer (in the scene that echoes Macbeth Act 3, Scene 4) tells an interrupted
tale that anticipates or recalls or reveals Washizu's treasonable acts. Throughout the
film, Lady Asaji's stillness of face and body and her almost mechanical movements, all
of which recall or duplicate Noh conventions, are terrifying. Nearly silent, almost
always inhumanly composed until the very end (though, for example, she dances
frenziedly while Washizu kills Tsuzuki/Duncan out of the audience's view), she
prompts Washizu to ever more horrific acts.
Critics originally dismissed Roman Polanski's Macbeth (1971) as a serious presenta-
tion of Shakespeare's play because the participation of Hugh Hefner, the executive
producer, and of Playboy Productions, seemed to be sponsoring a vulgarisation of the
play - naked witches (in the film's version of Act 4, Scene 1) and a nude Lady Macbeth
(in the equivalent of Act 5, Scene 1) do indeed appear - but later reflection shows this
film to be the most distinguished cinematic version of the play, as the presence of
Kenneth Tynan as co-author of the screenplay (with Polanski) suggests.
Polanski and Tynan produce an illuminatingly creative revision and echo of theat-
rical performances, especially of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, while also
adapting the play to film. Thus, as in many earlier theatrical productions, we see
enacted, often violently, moments the Folio's text represents only verbally: the execu-
tion of Cawdor; the stormy night that accompanies Duncan's arrival at, and death in,
Macbeth's castle; the banquet of Act 1, Scene 7; the drugging of the grooms and the
murder of Duncan (where Duncan awakes to see his murderer's indecision before the
bloody moment); the wakening grooms, looking at their smeared hands and faces
before the avenging Macbeth grasps Lennox's sword to kill them; Duncan's funeral
cortège (only alluded to, if that, in Act 2, Scene 4, of Shakespeare's text); Macbeth's
installation as king at Scone; the extraordinarily violent murders of Lady Macduff, her
children, and her retainers. Soliloquies in Shakespeare's text are sometimes repre-
sented as spoken, sometimes as 'voice-over' (where the actor does not visibly speak but
the audience hears the actor's voice), sometimes as a combination of 'spoken' and
'over-heard' sounds.
The film also reorders the play's scenes and the sequence of events within scenes.
First Murderer self-satisfiedly reports his 'success' in killing Banquo (Shakespeare's
Act 3, Scene 4) quite privately, for instance, before he and his murderous colleague are
led away to incarceration, and, we assume, death, in an oubliette; the second appearance
of Banquo's Ghost (in the Folio's Act 3, Scene 4) is omitted; Act 3, Scenes 5 and 6, are
deleted from the Folio's sequence (the film moves directly from the banquet to
Macbeth's last visit to the sisters) and lines from those scenes are inserted later;
offering a cinematic, not theatrical, continuity, the film follows its version of Act 5,
Scene 1, with Macbeth's medical-political conversation ('How does your patient,
doctor?') from Act 5, Scene 3, and, reversing the Folio's order, the film then turns to
an elaborate representation of the flight of the 'false thanes' (5.3.7). The film now
introduces lines from the Folio's Act 4, Scene 3, including a powerful moment when
Malcolm hands his own sword to the newly bereaved Macduff and says, 'Be this the

[8/] 
Introduction

whetstone of your sword' (4.3.231), and a plangent moment in which Lady Macbeth,
distraught, reappears (as, of course, she does not in the Folio) to speak the lines from
her husband's letter (Act 1, Scene 5) she had not spoken earlier. Almost at once, the
film presents Lady Macbeth's corpse, to which Macbeth speaks 'Out, out, brief
candle. . .' (5.5.22ff.). The film concludes with a sequence of violent, acrobatic,
highly persuasive sword-fights, ending with Macbeth's decapitation and (in Grand
Guignol style) the head's presentation on a pole. Macbeth remains resolute and, until
his final moments, invulnerable, as the sisters and apparitions had promised.
Polanski's film, or Polanski and Tynan's script, should be noted for several other
innovations. It introduces a young central couple (Jon Finch and Francesca Annis),
whose sexuality is an important dramatic element. It treats the Thane of Ross (played
by John Stride) as a thoroughly self-serving figure, whose political behaviour repeats,
emphasises, and contrasts with that of others (Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Macduff, for
instance): in the film, Ross is the Third Murderer of the Folio's Act 3, Scene 3, an
accomplice in the deaths of Lady Macduff and her family and retainers, and he is an
overt time-server in following Macbeth and then siding with Malcolm and Macduff.
The film concludes with Donaldbain turning back to the witches, in evident hope that
they will help him gain the throne (and therefore overthrow Malcolm), as they had
earlier led Macbeth to the kingship.
Yukio Ninagawa's Japanese adaptation of Macbeth came west in 1985 when Mikijiro
Hira portrayed Macbeth and Komaki Kurihara Lady Macbeth at the Edinburgh
Festival,1 and in 1987, when Masane Tsukayama replaced Hira, at the National
Theatre, London.2 Ninagawa's 'achingly beautiful' production was not well received
in Japan - it was regarded as a false version or translation of medieval Japanese culture
- but in European theatres the production was greeted rapturously.3 Ninagawa said, 'It
[the play, Macbeth] is set within a Buddhist family altar and everything happens within
that frame. There is such an altar in all Japanese houses, but that does not mean that
it is a religious frame. The altar is where your ancestors dwell, and the Japanese will
talk to their ancestors within this setting quite naturally. It is a link between
the living and the world of death . . .'4 This altar - 'a huge Butsudan . . . closed off
downstage by a pair of slatted doors across the whole stage-width'5 - framed and
enclosed the play's performance. The Butsudan's doors are moved 'by two aged

thoughtful and not entirely complimentary review, Plays and Players 410 (November 1987), 18-19.
Gordon notes (p. 18) that 'The musical score . . . is, somewhat deviously, derived from European
composers . . .'

crones', who sometimes respond to the play's events1 and who are Ninagawa's version
of the sisters and the Porter of Shakespeare's Macbeth, but the 'most pervasive visual
image' of the production 'is cherry blossom'.2 These blossoms, beautiful, fragile,
transitory, '[combine] regret at human madness and folly with awareness of earthly
beauty'3 and also recall Kurosawa's cinematic emphasis upon fatality and Polanski's
upon repetition.

Macbeth in the mind and in performance: Act 4, Scene 3

Macbeth has some curious narrative discontinuities (or irregularities, or illogicalities),
especially in the places - at the end of Act 3 and beginning of Act 4 - where material
by another author (probably Thomas Middleton) has probably been inserted into a
pre-existing and perhaps wholly Shakespearean text (see Textual Analysis, pp. 255-9
below). Such are the ills that any evolving theatrical text inherits as its producers seek
to make it new, fashionable, and commercially attractive, but the dramatic rhythm
here is also curious: first, a leisurely and cryptic conversation between Malcolm and
Macduff, then an abrupt, even discontinuous, passage (the English Doctor and the
King's Evil), followed by Ross's obliquely introduced and brutally announced news
from Scotland concluded by the patently 'stirring' move to free Scotland from the
tyrant's oppression.
Act 4, Scene 3, may have been maladroitly revised to include references to a disease,
the King's Evil, and the English monarch's supposed ability to cure it. King James was
interested in this 'magical' power; and it attracted his subjects' attention throughout
his reign.4 Whether or not it was revised, and whether or not it was well revised,
Macbeth Act 4, Scene 3, poses some extraordinary theatrical, dramatic, and intellectual
puzzles for producers, audiences, and critics.
Before this conversation in the English court (Act 4, Scene 3), Malcolm last ap-
peared discussing his father's murder with Donaldbain:

MALCOLM [To Donaldbain] Why do we hold our tongues, that most may claim
This argument for ours?
DONALDBAIN [To Malcolm] What should be spoken here,
Where our fate hid in an auger hole may rush
And seize us? Let's away. Our tears are not yet brewed.
MALCOLM [To Donaldbain] Nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion.
(2.3.113-17)

After this sotto voce conversation - the other characters are busy guessing at the
murderer's identity and reacting to Macbeth's announcement that he has killed the
grooms - the focus shifts to Lady Macbeth, who may faint here, or pretend to do so

Introduction

(see 2.3.112 n.), and the other characters' decision to put on 'manly readiness'. The
stage empties, leaving the two sons to make their decision.
This dialogue of unbrewed tears and unmoved sorrow may be a later interpolation
(see Textual Analysis, pp. 259-61 below); whether it is a second thought or not, one
of its evident purposes is to explain the sons' passivity, or their cowardice, which
'generally create[s] laughter', according to an eighteenth-century critic.1 Their only
previous contributions to the scene were two brief questions: Donaldbain's maladroit
'What is amiss?' (2.3.90) and Malcolm's grotesquely fatuous response to Macduff s
'Your royal father's murdered' - 'O, by whom?' (2.3.93). Malcolm and Donaldbain are
otherwise silent, and some contributor to the Folio text apparently sought to explain
that silence. Explanation paradoxically emphasises the passivity it would justify. What
needs no excuse gets none; what does, does. True, the sons' pallid lines underscore the
baroque imagery of blood, death, and Doomsday the other characters use, and true,
they may indeed have awakened not from beds but graves as Macduff says (2.3.72-4),
but it is true also that Donaldbain's fear over their 'fate hid in an auger hole' provides
an adequate reason for their silence. As Lady Macbeth's sleepy remarks on knowledge
and power suggest - 'Who knows it, when none can call our power to account?'
(5.1.32-3) - it may be better to remain silent than to draw attention, even if, or
especially if, one is Prince of Cumberland and Duncan's heir-designate (1.4.37-9).
With this ambiguous prelude, the royal sons, now alone on stage, share their last
exchange:

MALCOLM What will you do? Let's not consort with them.
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.
DONALDBAIN To Ireland, I. Our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are,
There's daggers in men's smiles; the nea'er in blood,
The nearer bloody.
MALCOLM 
This murderous shaft that's shot
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse,
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
But shift away. There's warrant in that theft
Which steals itself when there's no mercy left. 
(2.3.128-39)2

Here the issue of self-preservation is palpably central, while in the earlier conversation
it is only arguably so. Indeed, the first exchange may have been inserted to explain the
second and to diminish what looks suspiciously like cowardice or at least political
indifference and a rather unusual failure of the Shakespearean child to mourn its

1 See Francis Gentleman in Bell's Edition of Shakespeare's Plays, 1, Macbeth pagination sequence, p. 27:
'they [Malcolm, Donaldbain] generally create laughter, and their pusillanimous resolution of depar-
ture . . . deserves no better treatment'. Gentleman wrote in a theatrical era when Lady Macbeth's part
(played by Sarah Siddons, no less) was cut from Act 2, Scene 3. Byam Shaw thought Malcolm and
Donaldbain 'begin to panic' here (Macbeth Onstage, p. 103).
2 This passage is not so textually suspect as the sons' earlier conversation; Brooke seems to find this passage
textually puzzling (see his notes ad loc. and his Appendix A, pp. 220-1), but erroneous line numbers make
his views uncertain.

parent.1 Besides his ugly punning on 'theft' and 'warrant', Malcolm makes one par-
ticularly Janus-faced remark: 'To show an unfelt sorrow is an office / Which the
false man does easy.' Some members of the audience (especially, perhaps, the students
at the Inns of Court, ever watchful for fashionable phrases) may have reached for their
notebooks to record the speech under 'Hypocrisy', but the sententious remark really
challenges all shows of sorrow and indeed all absences of shows of sorrow. Where does
its stress lie? On 'unfelt', on 'false', or on 'easy'? Does the non-false man show an
unfelt sorrow with great difficulty, but show it none the less? Does a son, like
Malcolm, who is not showing sorrow for his father's death therefore qualify as non-
false because his unshown sorrow is in fact unfelt?2

I propose that someone involved in the making of Macbeth thought an audience
seeing Act 4, Scene 3, for the first time might find both Malcolm and Macduff
somehow suspect or unfixed, their traits either vague or unstable.3 That 'someone'
inserted two choric scenes to stabilise the audience's attitudes: in Act 2, Scene 4, we
first hear Macduff characterised as 'good' (line 20), and the scene supports the adjec-
tive through his refusal to attend Macbeth's coronation; in Act 3, Scene 6, Lennox and
an anonymous Lord testify to Malcolm's and Macduff s goodness and applaud their
alliance with England's holy Edward. Unfortunately, this putative effort confuses the
play's narrative, and one desperate critic goes so far as to claim that the pertinent lines
of Act 3, Scene 6, are ironic and that Lennox tests the Lord as Malcolm will test
Macduff.4

As with the epithet 'good Macduff, Act 3, Scene 6, proposes that Malcolm and
Macduff hold Scotland's future hopes, but Macduff has fled under mysterious, if not
morally ambiguous, circumstances, and his flight creates such extreme dramatic prob-

1 A telling analogy, if it is one, might be Hal's seizing the crown when he thinks Henry IV is dead; like
Duncan's sons, Hal reacts pragmatically first and mourns later. See Giorgio Melchiori (éd.), 2H4, 1989,
4.2.167-73 and 211-16.
2 Note, too, the use of'office' with its plural significations: 'That which one ought, or has, to do in the way
of service; that which is required or expected'; 'A position or place to which certain duties are attached';
'A ceremonial duty or service' (OED Office sb 2, 4, 5, respectively). The dutiful and the potentially
hypocritical elements in these definitions cut against both the 'false man' and the speaker.
3 So Barbara Riebling finds Malcolm at least; see 'Virtue's sacrifice: a machiavellian reading of Macbeth',
Studies in English Literature, 1500-1 goo, 31 (1991), 277-9. What I have said and will say about Act 4,
Scene 3, may seem no more than a footnote to the second section of Stephen Booth's 'King Lear',
'Macbeth ', Indefinition, and Tragedy, 1983; I hope not, but if so, it is an honourable estate. In Booth's view,
the audience believes, falsely but for a time comfortingly, 'that the comprehensibility of the container
[here, Macbeth] is of the nature of the thing ["tragedy"] contained' (p. 89), and he then argues, a little
equivocally, 'that Macbeth is itself, as a whole, a kind of equivocation between the fact of limitlessness -
indefinition, tragedy - and the duty of art to limit and define' (p. 98). I propose that Macbeth represents
or dramatises this equivocation and therefore smudges, however momentarily, the difference that Booth
finds between the play and the experience of it, between tragedy represented or dramatic tragedy
experienced in retrospect, and tragedy experienced in life — the fire that destroys a family Christmas, the
golden wedding anniversary heart-attack. That is, Macbeth knows what it is doing and what Stephen
Booth is thinking; on the other hand, 'If audiences were led to take conscious notice of the inconsistency
in their evaluations . . . they would presumably set about rationalizing . . . in an effort to make their
responses consistent' (p. 115), and I may be doing just that.
4 See Paul, p. 276, where he claims that Lennox is 'ironical' in Act 3, Scene 6, because 'Lennox knows that
Macduff has fled to England but is cautiously trying to find out whether the other lord knows this, and
what he thinks about it. . .'

Introduction

lems that William Davenant rewrote this section of the play and inserted a scene
elaborately justifying MacdufPs abandonment of his family.1 According to Davenant,
regicide is the unacceptable alternative to flight, and his solution to the problem
anticipated Nahum Tate's 1681 revision of King Lear, where Gloucester's good son
(Edgar) and Lear's good daughter (Cordelia) fall in love, partly to give 'Countenance
to Edgar's Disguise [as Tom o'Bedlam], making that a generous Design that was before
[in Shakespeare's play] a poor Shift to save his Life'.2 Davenant and Tate justify or
palliate what they construe as the 'poor Shift[s]' Shakespeare's characters employ 'to
save [their lives]' - that is, Davenant and Tate justify or palliate the characters'
represented cowardice.
In Macbeth Act 4, Scene 3 - 'slow', 'perverse', 'irritating', 'frustrating', and 'un-
pleasant' as it is3 - Malcolm elaborately indicts himself of hyperbolic evil:

there's no bottom, none,
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up
The cistern of my lust, and my desire
All continent impediments would o'erbear
That did oppose my will. . .
With this, there grows
In my most ill-composed affection such
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
Desire his jewels, and this other's house,
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more, that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Destroying them for wealth. 
(4.3.60-5, 76-84)

Malcolm finally declares he has none of the 'king-becoming graces', but abounds

In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Uproar the universal peace, confound
All unity on earth. 
(4.3.96-100)

Malcolm claims these evils, it seems, because he distrusts Macduff, particularly
because Macduff abandoned 'Those precious motives, those strong knots of love'
(4.3.27), his wife and children. Having answered Malcolm's earlier suspicions with
blunt denial - 'I am not treacherous' (18) - and plaintive resignation - 'I have lost my

hopes' (24) — Macduff now foresees a desperate, bloody, and tyrannical future. He
prepares to go:

Fare thee well, lord,
I would not be the villain that thou think'st
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
And the rich East to boot. 
(4.3.34-7)

Just as Macduff himself had earlier been carefully ambiguous about his attitudes
toward the new king when talking with Ross and the Old Man (2.4.21 ff), Malcolm
here intersperses placating or exculpating remarks, remarks that will save him should
Macduff prove either adherent or enemy to Macbeth: 'it may be so perchance' (11);
'Let not my jealousies be your dishonours' (29); 'Be not offended' (37).' Malcolm's
most notable attempt to have it both ways confounds dramatic representation and the
audience's credulity:

That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
Yet grace must still look so. 
(4.3.21-4)

In one powerful sense, the sense the play would have us understand as the only sense,
this remark is true: Macduff may be an honourable man whether or not Malcolm
thinks he is, just as angels are bright though Lucifer fell. Unfortunately for trust and
reason, the brightest did fall, and in life as in Hamlet, thinking makes it so. If Malcolm
or the audience thinks Macduff dishonourable, an agent provocateur, then effectively
Macduff is so, and the campaign to depose Macbeth ends before it starts, along with
the audience's certitude. For the audience, the paradox of Act 4, Scene 3, is the flip
side to Lady Macbeth's politically and epistemologically abhorrent confidence - 'Who
knows it, when none can call our power to account?' (5.1.32-3) - because the audience
has now been placed in the situation of those Scots who think they know but cannot
speak and cannot therefore act on their knowledge and its implications.

In the end, Act 4, Scene 3 attacks not just the characters' represented capacity to
know one another, but the audience's capacity to discriminate ethically and politically
among the represented personages. The scene attacks the bases of drama and admits
that attack when the unexpected reversal, equivalent to a sonnet's volta, finally arrives
and Malcolm chooses to believe MacdufPs honesty, his exasperated patriotism and his
desperate disappointment:

Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
To thy good truth and honour. 
(4.3.114-17)

Malcolm believes 'this noble passion, / Child of integrity' on evidence no better than,
nor different from, the grounds he had for doubting MacdufPs earlier asseverations.

1 Ian Richardson's brilliant performance in Peter Hall's 1967 Stratford production 'offered an unconven-
tional Malcolm with an inkling of evil deep inside' (Leiter, p. 378).

Introduction

The better the actors are at deceiving each other, the better they inevitably are at
deceiving the audience, and vice versa, as some celebrated actors have acknowledged.1

Suspicion and trust here both arise from a character's ethos, and Macduff justly
remarks, 'Such welcome and unwelcome things at once / 'Tis hard to reconcile' (138—
9). Indeed, 'tis. The scene has made every assertion, every trust, every doubt 'hard to
reconcile'. Here, humans palter with each other just as Macbeth claims the 'juggling
fiends' did with him, and just so the play palters in performance and on the page.

1 Trader Faulkner, who played Malcolm in the 1955 Stratford production, recalls arguing with Keith
Michell (Macduff), Laurence Olivier (Macbeth), and Byam Shaw (the director): 'They said, "You're too
convincing in the two contradictory aspects of the character. You're convincing when you say you're true
and you're totally convincing when you say I didn't mean a word of it" ' (Macbeth Onstage, p. [252]).

Scotland, showing place names mentioned in the text of Macbeth

NOTE ON THE TEXT

The First Folio (F) of Shakespeare's plays (1623) contains the earliest surviving text of
The Tragédie of Macbeth, where it is sixth among the tragedies, printed between Julius
Caesar and Hamlet; this text is probably derived from a Jacobean playhouse script
rather than from a literary or reading text. The theatrical tradition produced two other
important seventeenth-century printed texts: a quarto Macbeth in 1673 (Q1673) pub-
lished without Shakespeare's name but generally following F with some additional
material and several fascinating 'editorial' readings; and William Davenant's adapta-
tion of Macbeth, printed in 1674 and here designated 'Davenant'. Appendix 2, pp.
268-72 below, discusses the relation of Q1673 to F and to Davenant's 1674 version.
Q1673, Davenant's play, and Folio Macbeth almost certainly include the work of
Thomas Middleton, a distinguished younger contemporary of Shakespeare. All mod-
ern editions of'Shakespeare's' play, including this one, should therefore be considered
editions of 'Macbeth by William Shakespeare and adapted by Thomas Middleton', as
the 1986 Oxford edition of the Complete Works puts it.
The Folio text of Macbeth contains many moments where the staging is debatable;
this edition pays special attention to such moments. Modern editions differ principally
on two matters: first, lineation, particularly in the first half of the play, and second,
the treatment of passages almost certainly written by Middleton. Both subjects are
discussed in the Textual Analysis, pp. 251-9 below, as are the questions of'copy' for
the Folio, the compositors and printing of F, and the possible revision of F. The
Textual Analysis also describes the editorial procedures I have employed and, more
important, explains this edition's silent (that is, uncollated) changes to the text as it
appears in F.
Shakespeare's plays swoop disconcertingly from language and action that appear
unconstrained by time or place to highly precise (and, we must admit, sometimes now
unfathomable) references to particular words, customs, ideas, and preoccupations of
early modern England. This oscillation especially characterises his tragedies, and
Macbeth is a supreme example. I have reluctantly offered notes on the play's imaginary
locations, which may be in a notional eleventh-century Scotland and England, but
were once also on the Globe's stage and were therefore once part of early-seventeenth-
century London. Only an Enlightenment editor or reader might guess where the
witches are.
This text is a modernised one. For words that are now archaic, the modern equiva-
lent appears if it does not disturb the metre, rhyme, or wordplay; where earlier
editions have treated verbal changes as emendations, the collation records the change
as a modernisation. Thus, at 1.7.6 this text reads 'shoal' and the collation records F'S

Macbeth 
[ç6]

archaic form, 'Schoole' (which could, of course, at first seem to be the modern word
'school'):

shoal] F (Schoole)

For more complicated changes, the collation begins with the reading accepted into the
text followed by the source of that change, then by the Folio reading, and (in chrono-
logical order) any other plausible but rejected readings. Thus, a more complicated
example (2.2.66) might read:

green one red] Q1673, F4 (Green one Red); Greene one, Red F; green, One red
Johnson

which means that this text adopts a (modernised) reading shared by the theatrical
quarto of 1673 and F4, the Fourth Folio (1685), that is the equivalent of the First Folio
according to modern punctuational conventions, and that Samuel Johnson's edition
(1765) repunctuated the phrase and changed its meaning. Another example appears at
2.34-5:

Come in time - ] Brooke; Come in time, F; Come in, time, Q1673; Come in, Time;
Staunton; come in, time-server; NS; Come in farmer, Blackfriars (conj. Anon, in
Cam.)

This collation means: this text adopts Brooke's reading, a modernisation of F'S text;
Q1673 repunctuated the phrase; Howard Staunton, apparently unaware of Q1673,
conjectured the same reading as Q1673 and made 'time' an abstraction; John Dover
Wilson (in the New Shakespeare edition) offered an interesting emendation, as did
Robert Dent in the Blackfriars edition, following an earlier conjecture. When this text
follows F in a phrase longer than one or two words, but other editions have made
different choices, the collation records only those places where F differs from the text
offered here. Thus the collation for the stage direction at 4.1.131 reads:

F {Musicke . .. Dance . . .); Globe adds / with Hecate

indicating that this text differs from F only in the spelling and capitalisation of two
words, but that the Globe editors appended a further direction to the original one.

NOTE ON THE COMMENTARY

More frequently than any earlier edition, the Commentary here cites the Oxford
English Dictionary (OED) and other lexical sources, using the OED\ terminology for
parts of speech (sb for 'substantive', a noun; v for 'verb', a for 'adjective', ppl a for
'participial adjective', vbl sb for 'verbal substantive', etc.) and the numbered and
lettered sub-divisions in its entries. Exploiting Jùrgen Schàfer's and Bryan A. Gar-
ner's work on the OED and later texts antedating its citations and adding to these
works, the Commentary draws attention to words that may be Shakespearean coinages
and notes those places where Macbeth is the first text cited for a use or definition.
Other editions and earlier students of Shakespeare's language have not always re-
corded the play's verbal inventiveness; where appropriate, glosses and citations from
OED and of proverbial language therefore suggest where the play innovates or echoes
earlier usage by remarking how frequently a word or phrase occurs, or the date of the
first recorded use. This information may be wildly inaccurate, however, since much
lexicographical work remains to be done.
When I cite Macbeth, references are to lines as numbered here unless otherwise
noted; Shakespeare's other plays are cited from the Riverside edition, text éd. G. B.
Evans, 1974. Other editors' references to Shakespeare are similarly normalised, as are
their references to works where I cite different (and more accurate) editions. (See the
List of Abbreviations and Conventions, pp. xi—xxii above, for the works and editions
mentioned here, in the Commentary, and in the collation.) Greek and Latin texts are
cited from the appropriate Loeb edition with only the translator's name mentioned;
unattributed translations are mine. Unless otherwise noted, the Bible is quoted from
the so-called 'Bishops' Bible' (1568).

Notes
F does not provide a list. These notes principally concern the semi-legendary and historical
individuals dramatised in Macbeth, along with information about how proper names might have
been pronounced in Shakespeare's theatre.
DUNCAN Historically, Duncan I (reigned AD 1034-40).
MALCOLM Historically, Malcolm III (reigned AD 1057-93).
LENNOX His remark, 'my young remembrance' (2.3.54), m a v indicate his age.
ROSS Executed, according to Holinshed (Scotland, p. 171b), during the ten-year period of
Macbeth's reign as a good king.
MACBETH Historically, Mormaer of Moray; reigned AD 1040-57. Simon Forman (see pp.
57-8 above) once spells the name 'Mackbet', despite the evidence of the Folio (which rhymes it
with 'heath' at 1.1.7-8, and with 'death' at 1.2.64-5 a n^ 3-5-4~5) that the final th was sounded;
the rhymes with 'death' also strongly imply a short e in 'Macbeth' (Cercignani, pp. 76-7).
BANQUO Historically, Thane of Lochaber; Simon Forman's spellings (see pp. 57-8 above) -
Bancko, Banko, Banco - may indicate Jacobean pronunciation.
LADY MACBETH Historically, 'Gruoch', a descendant of either King Kenneth II (reigned AD
971-5) or of King Kenneth III (reigned PAD 997-1005).
MACDUFF Historically, Thane of Fife; Simon Forman (see pp. 57-8 above) spells this name
MackDove and Macdouee (i.e. Macdove), perhaps indicating Jacobean pronunciation; the name
rhymes with 'Enough' at 4.1.70-1.
DONALDBAIN The historical individual's name was also represented as Donaldbane,
Donalbane, Donald Bane, or Donald Ban (i.e. 'Donald the Fair'). Reigned as Donald III AD
1093-7-
CAITHNESS Executed, according to Holinshed (Scotland, p. 171b), during the ten-year
period of Macbeth's reign as a good king.
SEYTON For pronunciation of this name, see Supplementary Note on 5.3.19, p. 244 below.
SIWARD Historically, an Earl of Northumberland who died in AD 1055, two years before
Macbeth.

Act 1, Scene 1
Perhaps the most striking opening scene in
Shakespeare. Coleridge saw a particular contrast
with Hamlet: 'In the latter the gradual ascent from
the simplest forms of conversation to the language
of impassioned intellect, yet still the intellect re-
maining the seat of passion; in the Macbeth, the
invocation is made at once to the imagination, and
the emotions connected therewith' (Coleridge, p.
106). This romantic view diverged sharply from
that of Johnson, who defended playwright and
witches with a relativistic argument, 'however they
may now be ridiculed'. The setting is unlocalised,
but at least since Komisarjevsky's 
production
(Stratford, 1933) the sisters (or 'witches', see 0 SD
n.) have sometimes been imagined as battlefield
scavengers.
0 SD Thunder and lightning Witches were popu-
larly supposed to 'send raine, haile, tempests, thun-
der, lightening' (Scot, in, 13); see 1.3.10-13 n.
0 SD WITCHES Only at 1.3.5 does the dialogue
use the word witch; elsewhere they are named and
name themselves 'weird sisters', although 'Witches'
appears in many SDS. Male actors often play these
parts (see C. B. Young in NS, p. lxxii, and e.g. Colin
George's production, Sheffield Playhouse, October
1970). In his 1888 souvenir edn, Henry Irving
claimed (p. 6), 'this is, I believe, the first time that
the weird sisters have been performed by women';

on the eighteenth-century English stage, Ann Pitt
was the only female witch (Carlisle, p. 338). See
illustration 2, p. 18 above. For the witches' early
costuming, see Supplementary Note, p. 239 below.
1 When The play's first word concerns time, a
topic that will become increasingly important and is
always more significant than place, 'Where' (6).
3 hurly-burly turmoil, tumult, especially of re-
bellion or insurrection. Reduplications with suf-
fixed -y are common in English (e.g. topsy-turvy,
handy-dandy, wishy-washy), but the see-saw child-
ishness is here appropriate to the sisters' obscurely
ominous way of speaking and the teetering confu-
sion of opposites to follow.
4 battle conflict F'S 'Battaile' could also mean
'body . . . of troops . . . composing an entire army,
or one of its main divisions' {OED Battle sb 8a),
a meaning appropriate to the slaughter soon
described.
4 lost, and won Possibly proverbial (Dent
W408.1); see 1.2.67 n.
7 heath wilderness; uninhabited and unculti-
vated ground.
9 Graymalkin A cat's name. 'Malkin' is a di-
minutive of 'Maud' or 'Matilda' (see OED Malkin
and Mawkin); 'malkin' is also slang for 'slut, lewd
woman' (Williams). It was a 'peculiarly English no-
tion' (Thomas, p. 445) that cats and toads (see 10
n.), as well as dogs, rats, and some insects, were

13 SD Precisely how the witches depart here and
at 1.3.76 (on foot, through a trap-door, or flying?) is
complicated by Hecate's departure in 3.5, which
may stipulate a flying exit but is also probably an
addition by Thomas Middleton (see Textual Analy-
sis, pp. 255-9 below); the sisters' departure in 4.1 -
vanish (4.1.131 SD) - is also probably Middleton's.
Wickham ('Fly', pp. 172-3, 177-8) concludes that
Shakespeare's witches did not fly, but Middleton's
(added) Hecate did. See also Textual Analysis, pp.
256-7. Eighteenth-century editors add SDS - fly
away (Rowe), vanish (Malone) - recording later and
certainly mechanised stage practice.

Act 1, Scene 2
This 
scene 
condenses 
three 
conflicts 
-
Macdonald's rebellion, and invasions by Sweno and
by Canute - described in Scotland, pp. i68b-i7ob,
where 'Norwegian' and 'Danish' are indiscrimi-
nately applied to the foreign forces; Shakespeare (or
another author) leaves the third vaguest, perhaps
because James VI and I's wife Queen Anne was

Danish. The setting may be imagined as Duncan's
command post, near a battlefield (as Alarum (o SD. I )
suggests), but distant enough from 'Fife' (48) to
make that a plausible place of origin for Ross and
Angus. Jones, Scenic, pp. 208-9, argues that this
scene 'seems modelled on the opening scene of /
Henry IV, and Mark Rose, Shakespearean Design,
1972, pp. 83-8, finds several complex patterns in
the first act; thus, e.g., this scene and the following
two are all 'field' scenes, followed by three 'castle'
scenes.
o SD. 1 Alarum A call to arms; a warning to give
notice of danger (OED Alarm sb 4a and 5). 'Nor-
mally, 
the 
term 
[a 
variant 
spelling 
of
'alarm']. . . signifies 
a battle . . . and 
includes
clashes of weapons, drumbeats, trumpet blasts,
shouts - anything to make a tumult' (Long, p. 131).
'Every Souldier shall diligently observe and learne
the sound of Drummes, Fifes, and Trumpets to the
end he may knowe how to answere the same in his
service' (Thomas and Leonard Digges, An Arith-
metical Warlike Treatise named Stratioticos, rev. edn
(1590), sig. 2C2r); see also Harbage, pp. 52-3.
0 SD.I within i.e. off-stage. In the Jacobean thea-
tre, within indicates the tiring-house which formed
the back wall of the stage. The actors entered from
and exited to this space, where they also changed
their costumes.
o SD.2 meeting This direction may not be Shake-
speare's; it seems likely to mean that the wounded
speaker is on stage and the king's company enters to
him. See Supplementary Note, p. 239 below.
2 seemeth . . . plight The first of many infer-
ences (note 'seemeth'), some incorrect, from ap-

cuous as her lover, Macdonald, is politically errant.
The opprobrium of each term reinforces that of the
other, so that the phrase almost becomes an epithet.

referents are not clear until Duncan acknowledges
Macbeth's victory (24). Then we understand that
'slave' and 'him' (20, 22) = Macdonald, and 'he'
(20, 22) = Macbeth. Compositor A (see Textual
Analysis, p. 250 below) may have erred, but the
passage conveys breathlessly broken grammar and
unfixed identities, thus anticipating Macbeth's drift
into treason, into being like Macdonald and
Cawdor.
21 shook hands Elizabethans customarily shook
hands upon meeting as well as parting; see Dent ss6
and e.g. Peele, David and Bethsabe line 566 (meet-
ing), and Webster, Duchess ofMalfi 3.2.131-5 (part-
ing). For civil Scots warriors, see p. 12 above.

22 unseamed him ripped him up. The image is
from undoing a garment's seam and represents the
body as clothing; the line offers an auditory pun
(seem/seam) that may hint that Macbeth's violence
defeated deception ('un-seemed').
22 nave navel (umbilicus), probably; this line is
the sole support for nave = navel in OED. Both
'nave' and 'navel' could also mean 'central part or
block of a wheel' (OED Nave sb1 ia); compare OED
Navel sb 3 and Hal's description of Falstaff as 'this
nave of a wheel' (2H4 2.4.255). Figuratively, then,
'nave' may here refer to the crotch rather than the
navel per se (see 19 n.). See illustration 3, p. 21
above. For the unusual act of unseaming upward,
Steevens3 compared 'Then from the navell to the
throat at once, / He [Neoptolemus] ript old Priam'
(Marlowe, Dido, Queen of Carthage 2.1.255-6); as
NS, p. xli, notes, Shakespeare apparently remem-
bers this speech in writing the Player King's speech
(see Ham. 2.2.471 ff.).

the comforting sun also rises (' 'gins his reflection');
(2) when the sun reaches the vernal equinox and
returns ('reflection'), springtime storms (equinoc-
tial gales) occur. The question turns on whether
'spring' = 'source of water' or = 'season of the year'
and whether 'reflection' = 'shining' or = 'astro-
nomical regression of the sun at the equinox'. There
is no evidence for the last definition (first offered in
Singer2), and 'swells' supports 'spring' = 'source of
water'.
25 'gins begins (an aphetic form).
25 reflection shining (Lexicon); return, regres-
sion (OED Reflection 4c, citing this line as the first
of only two quotations).

ticipial adjective (Schàfer).
26 direful dreadful, terrible.
26 thunders The verb 'come' is understood
here, though spoken only in 27. Many editors insert
'break'.

time, identifies Duncan as king.

Duncan analogous to personified Justice, Macbeth

30 trust their heels run away. 'To trust to one's

31-62 Historically, the 'Norwegian lord' (31) was
Sweno (Svend Estridsen), who invaded in AD 1041
(Sugden); Sweno's invasion began victoriously in
Fife and extended over a period of time (Scotland,
pp. i69a-i7ob). The so-called 'Sueno's Stone'
(dating from some time between the ninth century
and the eleventh), an extraordinary carved pillar

commemorating a battle, probably not this one, still
stands just north-east of Forres. See illustration 5,

35 The sergeant, or captain, speaks ironically:
Banquo and Macbeth were not 'dismayed', but the
subsequent unexpected inversions anticipate the
disorder Macbeth and Lady Macbeth will introduce
into Scotland, where all 'natural' orderings are
overturned.

destroyed most Renaissance weapons, but the lan-
guage echoes the play's insistence on doubling and

42 gashes . . . help Shakespeare and other
dramatists often represent wounds as mouths. For
Antony, dead Caesar's wounds 'like dumb mouths
do ope their ruby lips' (JC 3.1.260), a Roman citi-
zen suggests, 'we are to put our tongues into those
wounds and speak for them' (Cor. 2.3.6-7), and
John Beane's many wounds are 'fifteene mouthes'
accusing his murderer (Warning, sig. HIV). Here,
the captain's wounds are speech, as Macbeth's
words to his wife (in 1.5) and hers to him (in 1.7)
will also be speeches, which are, or lead to, wounds.
44 smack savour, taste (OED Smack vl 2), mixed

Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapped in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point, rebellious arm 'gainst arm,
Curbing his lavish spirit. And to conclude,
The victory fell on us -

Great happiness ! -

The Norways' king, craves composition.
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colm's Inch

Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death
And with his former title greet Macbeth.

in order to rationalise 1.3.70-1 (see n.) and 1.3.106,

67 lost.. . won Transfer of the title (and the
treason) from Cawdor to Macbeth exemplifies
how something may be both lost and won, the
witches' paradox (1.1.4). The line elegantly varies
the proverb 'No man loses but another wins' (Dent
M337)-

Act 1, Scene 3
As with all the witch-scenes, the location here is
vague (a 'heath' ( 1.1.7)); Macbeth and Banquo seem
to be travelling to Torres' (37), perhaps from 'Fife'
(1.2.48), many miles distant geographically if not
dramatically. For the intersection of human curios-
ity with prophecy, see Ant. 1.2.1-78. Forman (11,
337) apparently says he saw Macbeth and Banquo
on horseback, not an impossible stage effect (see
Woodstock 3.2.132-73), but an unlikely one here (see
Leah Scragg, 'Macbeth on horseback', S.Sur. 26
(1973), 81-8). See 3.3.11-14 n.
o SD the F'S article (absent in 1.1.0 SD, but present
at 3.5.0 SD and 4.1.0 SD) may suggest revision or a
theatrical sense of the witches as a dramatic unit or
force. Compare 2.1.20 and 4.1.38 SD.
2 Killing swine English witches were often ac-
cused of harming domestic animals.
4 munched 'A Scottish word signifying to eat
with the gums when toothless' (Travers), but
'where shals all munch' (Dekker [and Thomas
Middleton], The Roaring Girl 2.1.356), a question
about where to eat, suggests a more general and
English usage.
5 Aroint The word's meaning is unknown, and
Poor Tom's 'aroynt thee Witch, aroynt thee' (Lear
TLN 1903) is the only other early recorded instance
(Schàfer); contextually, it seems to mean 'avaunt! be
gone!' Dent W584 cites John Ray, Collection of Eng-

lish Proverbs (1679): 'Aroint thee, witch, quoth
Besse Locket to her mother.'
5 rump-fed A puzzling phrase whose literal
meaning is 'fed on rump'. 'Rump' = the hind quar-
ter of both humans and the animals they eat, and the
'rumpe or buttocke peece of meat' (John Florio, A
Worlde of Words (1598), under Groppone, antedat-
ing OED Buttock sb 2 by twenty-five years) was a
desirable cut. Shakespeare elsewhere imagines the
'devil Luxury [Lechery], with his fat rump' (Tro.
5.2.55); given the sexual innuendo of the next lines,
'rump-fed' might thus also mean 'fed [i.e. fattened]
in the rump, lecherous' (compare Marston's The
Dutch Courtesan (1605), where the title's courtesan
is described as 'a plump-rump'd wench' (Dutch
Courtesan 4.3.2)), and by the Restoration 'rump'
had numerous bawdy meanings (whore, genitals,
copulate: see the article 'Rump' in Williams), and
scatological vocabulary frequently blurs and ex-
changes words for fundament and genitals (see e.g.
the article 'Arse' in Williams). A link between feed-
ing and lechery has strong biblical precedent: 'when
I had fed them to the full, they then committed
adulterie, and assembled themselves by troupes in
the harlots houses' (Jer. 5.7, AV). Shakespeare's
two other uses (1H4 2.2.84, MND 2.1.45) of
phrases compounding a noun with '-fed' are active
and support instead the meaning 'fed on rump';
compare 'lust-dieted' (Lear 4.1.67). From the
witch's point of view, therefore, it may be that the
sailor's wife is enviable, selfish, lecherous, and (pos-
sibly) sexually satisfied. Perhaps alliteration (rump,
runnion) is more important than denotation. See
next note.
5 runnion Abusive term applied to a woman

to casual use of prick today'. The same might be true
here. See preceding note.
6 Aleppo Inland trading city in northern Syria,
part of the Turkish empire from 1516 to 1918. Its
port was Iskanderun (Sugden).
6 master captain, commanding officer.
6 Tiger Common name for a ship. The name also
appears in TN 5.1.62 and many other contemporary
texts. E. A. Loomis, 'Master of the Tiger\ SQ 7
(1956), 457, showed that the calamitous Far Eastern
voyage of one Tiger, lasting from 5 December 1604
to 27 June 1606, equalled 567 days or 81 weeks (i.e.
7 X 9 X 9, or 'Weary sennights nine times nine'
(21)).
7 sieve Sailing in sieves was supposed to be a
common witch-practice; it was one of the accusa-
tions against the Scottish witches King James per-
sonally interrogated in 1590-1 (Nerves, pp. 13-14).
8 r a t . . . tail Steevens observes that witches
sometimes turned themselves into rats, but had no
body part to match the tail; see also 1.1.9 a
9 do act; fornicate. 'Many dramatizations of
witches as powerful, dangerous agents associate
their agency with female sexual desire' (Dolan, p.
212).
10—13 Witches were imagined to control the
wind and might sell this power on request; see
Newes, p. 17 (Scottish witches were accused of in-
terfering with James's return from Denmark with
Anne, his bride), and what seems to be Thomas

Nashe's allusion to that event: 'as in Ireland [i.e.
Scotland?] and in Denmark both / Witches for gold
will sell a man a wind' (Nashe, in, 272). Muir cites
many other references to such witch-practices.
14 Even places of refuge ('ports') cannot escape
the winds' ferocity. (OED Blow v] has no apposite
meaning.)
15 quarters geographical directions.
16 Although the witches speak a distinctive metre
and irregular rhyme, this line is unusually short and
another line, rhyming with 'card', may have been
omitted.
16 card chart; circular piece of stiff paper (the
'mariner's card' or 'card of the sea' showing the
customary 32 points of the compass). OED Card sb1

3b, 4a admits that the two meanings were not fully
distinguished at this date. See illustration 6, p. 39
above.
17 drain him If the first witch intends to be a
succubus, her demonic sexual intercourse (see 'do'
(9)) will exhaust her sailor-victim.
17 dry as hay A very old simile (Dent H231.1).
18 Sleep . .. day Like the sailor, Macbeth will
later (3.2) find sleep difficult, and Lady Macbeth
will walk in her sleep (5.1).
19 penthouse lid eyelid. The image derives
from analogy between the eyebrow and the project-
ing second storey ('penthouse') of many Eliza-
bethan buildings. 'Penthouse' could = iean-to
shed' (Hunter), but Shakespeare's non-figurative
uses of the word (Ado 3.3.103, MV 2.6.1) do not
employ that meaning.
20 forbid cursed (OED Forbid v 2f, quoting only
this line and another, using 'forbidden', from 1819).

37-40 What... on't Banquo notices the witch-
es; like the king's company in 1.2, he judges appear-
ances, though not so confidently. His speech
(38-45) is also the only spoken evidence for the
witches' appearance, which may be (and has been in
some productions) quite different. Holinshed's
1577 illustration of this scene represents the witches
as mortal women, not old, fashionably, even
aristocratically, dressed (see Bullough, vu, 494),
thus giving the paradox of 'fair is foul' (1.1.12)

been so foule within' (Fidèle and Fortunio line 703).

46-8 Political prophecy, especially on the eve of
conflict, has a long history and was dangerous in the
Tudor and Stuart period. Shakespeare dramatised

(1977), 221-30; Howard Dobin, Merlin's Disciples:
Prophecy, Poetry and Power in Renaissance England,

haruspicy, official prophecy based upon the exami-
nation of the entrails of animals, etc.
46 All hail Shakespeare elsewhere (3H6 5.7.33-
4, R2 4.1.169-71 ) associates this phrase with Judas's
betrayal of Jesus, as do his contemporaries (see 'the
All-haile of a second Judas' in A Letter. . .
containing a true Report of a strange Conspiracie
(1599), sig. B2r, and the York and Chester cycles of
mystery plays (see M. Hattaway (éd.), 3H6, 1992,

46 Glamis Metre sometimes requires a disyll-
able (Gla-miss); elsewhere, modern productions
often employ the modern monosyllable, 'Glahms'.
The name might have had a particular resonance for
Shakespeare and his audience. Scotland, p. 320a,
reports the trial (1537) of Jane Douglas, Lady
Glamis, for attempting to poison James V; she was
convicted on false evidence and burned at the stake.
Perhaps misled by the manner of execution, subse-
quent writers recorded her crime as witchcraft. See

116 behind 'in the past' (OED Behind adv ic);
'still to come' (OED Behind adv 4). In the former
sense, Macbeth regards as 'greatest' the first two
titles (Glamis, Cawdor) the sisters used (46-7); in
the latter possible sense, the kingship ('king hereaf-
ter' (48)) is 'greatest'.
118 those that gave Macbeth understands the
sisters, not Duncan, to be the source of his new title.

logue sb ib, quoting 'my death . . . is made the pro-
logue to their play' (2H6 3.1.148, 151) as its first
example). Theatrically, 'prologues' are actors (like
the sisters, or Ross and Angus) who speak before a
play (or an 'act' of one) begins.
127 swelling expanding, growing. With 'act',
'swelling' might refer to the number of actors who
enter after a prologue has spoken and to the number
of people who attend upon a king as opposed to a
thane (see next note). Compare 'A kingdom for a
stage, princes to act, / And monarchs to behold the
swelling scene!' (H5, Prologue, 3-4). Given the
play's concentration on child-bearing and childless-
ness, it seems likely that 'swelling' has at least a
distant connotation of pregnancy; compare 3.1.60-5
and see pp. 45-6 above.
128 the imperial theme the subject or topic of
empery (= becoming not 'emperor', but king);
'theme' could also have the more active meaning of
'a subject that causes action' (see OED Theme ia
and b), so 'imperial theme' might refer not only to
the topic of becoming king, but to the actions re-
quired of one who would be king.
128 I thank you, gentlemen Macbeth again
(see 116) interrupts himself, acknowledging Ross
and Angus, perhaps in order to conceal his self-
communing.

Those in commission yet returned?
MALCOLM 
My liege,
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die, who did report
That very frankly he confessed his treasons,
Implored your highness' pardon, and set forth
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it. He died
As one that had been studied in his death,
To throw away the dearest thing he owed
As 'twere a careless trifle.
DUNCAN 
There's no art
To find the mind's construction in the face.
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust.

2 liege i.e. liege lord (the feudal superior to
whom a vassal owes allegiance). In Shakespeare's
day, the title no longer carried legal obligations and
was mostly one of great respect.
3-4 A notable example of the play's insistence on
mediated knowledge, on information travelling
through reports and unofficial channels.
3 spoke spoken (Abbott 343).
5^7 In the early modern period, no matter how
recalcitrant convicted criminals had been, they typi-
cally did confess, repent, and beg forgiveness as
they prepared to face divine judgement; see L. B.
Smith, 'English treason trials and confessions in the
sixteenth century', jfHI 15 (1954), 471-98, espe-
cially pp. 476-80, and J. A. Sharpe, ' "Last dying
speeches": religion, ideology and public execution
in seventeenth-century England', P&P 107 (May
1985), 144-67.
8 Became Graced, befitted (OED Become v 7).
9 studied skilled, practised. There is no overtone
of the modern connotation 'affected', but perhaps
an acknowledgement of traditional religious prac-
tice (see Beach Langston, 'Essex and the art of dy-
ing', HLQ_ 13 (1949-50), 109-29, and Nancy Lee
Beaty, The Craft of Dying, 1970). 'To owe God a
death' is proverbial (Dent G237), and versions ap-
pear elsewhere in Shakespeare (e.g. Rj 2.2.91-5).
10 owed owned. Elizabethan spelling did not dis-
tinguish between 'owe' and 'own'; Malcolm may
therefore also allude to the idea that every Christian
owes God a soul. See 5.9.5 and n.

11 As As if. See Abbott 107, noting that the
subjunctive 'were' implies 'if.
11 careless uncared for (OED Careless 4a, quot-
ing this line), unregarded. Cawdor threw away his
soul as if it were a trifle he cared nothing about.
1 1 - 1 2 There's no a r t . . . face A proverbial tru-
ism - 'The face is no index to the heart' (Dent FI.I,
citing Juvenal, Satire 2: 'Frontis nulla fides') - that
Duncan has apparently just discovered. Foakes
notes the lines' ironic applicability to Macbeth,
'who enters just after they are spoken, or, as some
actors have played the part, in time to overhear
them'. Immediately before his arrest and execution,
the pathetically impercipient Hastings fails to read
the mind in Richard of Gloucester's face: 'never a
man in Christendom / Can lesser hide his love or
hate than he, / For by his face straight shall you
know his heart' (/?j 3.4.51-3); Vincentio, himself in
disguise, uses the truism to flatter and gain his way:
'There is written in your brow, Provost, honesty
and constancy; if I read it not truly, my ancient skill
beguiles me' (MM 4.2.153-5). Compare 'You are
well-favoured and your looks foreshow / You have
a gentle heart' (Per. 4.1.85-6). Duncan's remark
might have been prompted by Holinshed's observa-
tion (Scotland, p. 150a) that King Duff, murdered
in one 'Donwald's' castle at Forres, was uncautious
because he had 'a speciall trust in Donwald, as a
man whom he never suspected'. Compare 1.5.60-4.

bolic antithesis: (1) anything ('the rest') not done for
you is work ('labour'); (2) resting ('the rest') is fa-
tiguing unless done on your behalf; (3) rest is labour
when I refrain from serving you. This involuted

language conveys polite deference rather than any
easily paraphrasable sense: Macbeth stresses that
'you' (Duncan, his importance and his favour to
Macbeth) give meaning to whatever 'we' (Macbeth,
Lady Macbeth, and presumably their retainers)
do, however others may judge our actions.

Duncan agrees with Banquo's (unheard)
remark: Macbeth is just as brave ('full so valiant') as
Banquo has said; praising Macbeth gives Duncan
pleasure. Macbeth's aside has apparently 'covered'
Banquo's comment to Duncan.
56 banquet Wordplay on 'Banquo' (54).
58 peerless without equal. This word 'prepares
us for Macbeth's refusal to remain a thane among
thanes; only a monarch is literally peerless'
(Mahood, p. 44).

Act 1, Scene 5
Lady Macbeth reads her husband's letter and
later meets him in some private room of their castle
at Inverness, to which Duncan has said he and his
court will travel (1.4.42).
1 - 1 2 This letter is another example (see 1.2.2,46,
and 1.3.37-40) of mediated and interpreted knowl-
edge; it amplifies (and distorts) an episode we have
witnessed (1.3). Concerning such letters, Jonas
Barish (in Biggs, p. 36) makes a general point:
'Shakespeare is not concerned about meticulous
quotation; he is quite ready to rewrite a passage to
include information missing from the "original"
version . . .'; Mark Taylor, 'Letters and readers in
Macbeth, King Lear, and Twelfth Night', PQ 69
(1990), 31-53, claims (pp. 36-7) that Macbeth's

'letter is a covert directive . . . to push him toward
regicide'.
2 perfectest report most reliable testimony.
The words may refer to Macbeth's learning of his
new title (Cawdor) from Ross and Angus, but he
also called the witches 'imperfect speakers' (1.3.68).
For 
F'S 'perfect'st', see 5.1.6m.
5 vanished Another hint of the witches' stage
business.
5 Whiles While. The spelling is not archaic, ac-
cording to OED.
5 rapt Compare 1.3.141, where Macbeth is 'rapt'
after learning of his new title rather than after the
witches' address.
6 missives messengers (OED Missive sb 3; this
line is the earliest citation, and the last is from
1649).
6 all-hailed saluted with 'All hail'. Macbeth's
letter transfers the 'all-hail' from the witches to
Ross and Angus.
6 Thane of Cawdor Many editors mark this
phrase as quoted speech, and F may seek to do the
same through printing 'Thane' in roman type with
the remainder of the letter in italic, but F does not
distinguish the obviously quoted words 'haile King
that shalt be' (TLN 356).

14-23 y e t . . . undone A speech that appears to
be a static description of Macbeth's 'nature' and
inherent moral values ('thy nature . . . is too full
o'th'milk of human kindness' (14-15)) is in fact
Lady Macbeth's progressive meditation on how she
may influence both nature and values (16-20) and
therefore move her husband to action. See p. 33
above.
15 milk of human kindness i.e. compassion
characteristic of humane persons (OED Milk sb1 2c).
F reads 'humane', and 'humane' (= gentle, compas-
sionate) was not distinguished orthographically
from 'human' before 1700 or later (see also 3.4.76);
'kindness' principally means 'kinship', but also con-
notes 'category' ('kind' = classification, group) and
'naturalness' ('kind' = nature). Later uses of the
phrase 'milk of human kindness' apparently derive
from this line. Compare Goneril's rejection of her
husband's 'milky gentleness' (Lear 1.4.341) and see
1.7.54-8 and 4.3.98.
16 catch snatch (OED Catch i> 21 and 13).
16 nearest way most direct route, short-cut. For
the moral overtones, compare the proverbial 'The
shortest way is commonly the foulest, the fairer way
not much about' (Dent W142.1).

18 illness wickedness, depravity.
18 highly intensely, greatly (OED Highly adv
3a), but another meaning, 'in or to a high rank'
(OED Highly adv 2a), hints that 'highly' might
mean 'nobly, in a manner suiting an individual of
high rank'.
19 holily.with sanctity and devoutness (OED
Holily 1, quoting this line, but omitting the implicit
sense, 'guiltlessly').
19-20 wouldst n o t . . . win While this phrase
seems to repeat the preceding one, it makes
Macbeth criminally ambitious (he would 'wrongly
win') and self-deceiving (he would 'play false' =
cheat) where the other stressed his high, but holy,
ambition.
21 That which cries A voice that says (e.g. Lady
Macbeth's own voice, or the crown).
21 'Thus thou must do' F does not indicate
what 'That' says. Pope introduced quotation marks
for 'Thus thou . . . should be undone' (21-3), and
most editors follow him or Hanmer, who treated
'Thus thou . . . have it' as the quoted matter. Any
choice would be difficult to convey in the theatre.
21 if thou have it i.e. if you would gain great-
ness (or the crown); 'would' is understood from its
previous uses.
22 that A reference to 'Thus thou must do' (21)
- kill Duncan - rather than to 'That which cries' -
the urging or desire to kill Duncan.

25 valour . . . tongue Misogynistically, Eliza-
bethan culture considered men valorous, women
talkative; thus Beatrice, 'my lady Tongue', accuses
Benedick of unmanliness: 'But manhood is melted
into cur'sies, valour into compliment, and men are
only turned into tongue' (Ado 2.1.275 and 4.1.319-
20). This patriarchal belief did grant women the
power to encourage men: 'Methinks a woman of
this valiant spirit / Should, if a coward heard her
speak these words, / Infuse his breast with magna-
nimity, / And make him, naked, foil a man at arms'
(Prince Edward of Queen Margaret, 3H6 5.4.39-
42).
26 impedes hinders, obstructs. This line is
OED's earliest citation for 'impede' (Schàfer).
26 golden round i.e. the crown (as at 4.1.87).
'Mrs. Siddons used to elevate her stature, to smile
with a lofty and uncontrollable expectation, and,
with an arm raised beautifully in the air, to draw the
very circle she was speaking of, in the air about her
head, as if she ran her finger round the gold' (Leigh
Hunt, Tatler, 15 March 1831, quoted in Sprague, p.
232; this action became 'a common piece of tradi-

tional business', according to Michael Mullin,
'Stage and screen: the Trevor Nunn Macbeth', SQ
38 (1987), 351).
27 metaphysical more than physical, super-
natural (White).
27 doth Singular verb in -th with plural subject

28 SD ATTENDANT The dialogue makes clear
that this speaker is a member of the household, an
'attendant', not a 'messenger' (as in F). Costume and
perhaps props would have distinguished messenger
from attendant in Jacobean productions.
29 Lady Macbeth reacts either because she mo-
mentarily thinks the servant refers (treasonably) to
Macbeth as 'The king' or because Duncan's unex-
pected arrival seems too pat, an instant example of
'fate and metaphysical aid' (27).
31 informed reported; given information (an
intransitive use; see OED Inform v 7a, quoting this
line as the first example).
31 preparation Pronounced as five syllables.
32-5 As in the report of Cawdor's execution
(1.4.2-11), unofficial messengers travel faster than
official ones, and Shakespeare stresses the details of
speed and exhaustion.
33 had the speed of him outdistanced him
(OED Speed sb 10b, citing only this line and another

1.5.70) became 'thick' or the 'passage' was stopped,
no emotional or psychological changes could take
place, although there might be other consequences:

'there be feavers . . . which are ingendered of thick-
ening and stopping of the conduites and passages'
(Barrough, p. 168). NS cites 'Thoughts that would
thick my blood' (WT 1.2.171) and 'if that surly
spirit, melancholy, / Had baked thy blood and
made it heavy, thick' (John 3.3.42-3); compare 'that

medical theory held that a mother's blood (see 41-2)
was converted into milk (see Patricia Crawford,
'The sucking child: adult attitudes to child care in
the first year of life in seventeenth-century Eng-
land', Continuity and Change 1 (1986), 30); here
blood becomes gall. Capell (Notes, p. 7) says the
spirits 'are summon'd magnificently to suck
encrease of malignity from the "gall" of her
breasts'. 'But perhaps Lady Macbeth is asking the
spirits to take her milk as gall, to nurse from her
breast and find in her milk their sustaining poison'
(Adelman, p. 135).

48 thick dense, profound. The word appears
three times in this act and only once (4.1.33) again.
49 pall cover or drape as with cloth. The verb
evokes the noun 'pall' (cloth, altar-cloth, covering
for a hearse or coffin, robe, garment) and joins Lady
Macbeth's wish with Macbeth's earlier anxieties
about 'borrowed robes' (1.3.107). Barnhart Diction-

ary of Etymology, 1988, defines pall as 'shroud', the
wrapping of a corpse. See 1.7.3 n.

53 all-hail i.e. associated with the salutation, 'all
hail!' The phrase 'all-hail' is treated as an adjective,
'hereafter' as a noun: Macbeth will be 'Greater . . .

MACBETH Tomorrow, as he purposes.
LADY MACBETH 
O never
Shall sun that morrow see.
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time, bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue; look like th'innocent flower,
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
Must be provided for, and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch,
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

To alter favour ever is to fear.

Act 1, Scene 6
The audience is to imagine the setting as an ap-
proach to Macbeth's castle. NS regards the scene as
a daylight one, but F and (in a celebrated stage set-
ting) Henry Irving treat it as nocturnal (see Hughes,
Irving, p. 100). For contemporary ceremonies used
in greeting important visitors, see Heal, passim, es-
pecially pp. 32-3; the guest's rank governed the
ceremony; it determined by whom, by how many,
and where the guest was met upon arriving at an
aristocratic residence.
o SD Hautboys, and Torches Players of hautboys,
and torch-bearers. Tudor and early Stuart hautboys
(also called 'bombards') were treble members of the
shawm family, loud-sounding instruments much
favoured in courts and by the military (Bate, pp. 30-
3); Langham (p. 41) describes an outdoor welcome
for Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth Castle in 1575:
'This Pageaunt waz clozd up with a delectabl har-
mony of Hautboiz, Shalmz, Cornets, and such
oother looud Muzik.' The modern oboe, with
which editors and critics sometimes confuse the
hautboy, was not introduced into England until c.
1674-6 (Bate, pp. 40-1; compare Greg, p. 394 n.
18). NS deletes F'S Torches because they are inap-
propriate to a daylight scene, which this one may,
but need not, be.
1-10 Both Duncan and, more surprisingly,
Banquo here accept a superficial appearance and
misread a 'face' (note 'temple' and 'breath' (4-5)),
the castle's aspect; compare Duncan's reaction to
Cawdor's treason (1.4.11-14) and Banquo's to the
sisters' appearance and speech (1.3.37-45, 5°~2>
81-3, 122-5). Duncan and Banquo misread as
'gentle' (3) and 'procréant' (8) a castle whose 'battle-
ments' will prove 'fatal' to both (1.5.37-8).
1-2 Rowe's relineation (see Appendix 3, p. 276
below), followed here, scans regularly with a tro-

chaic substitution ('Nimbly') at the start of the se-
cond pentameter.
1 seat situation, site (OED Seat sb 18, quoting
this line). 3-10 make another transferred meaning -
'place of habitation or settlement (of birds)' (OED
Seat sb 16a) - likely, although OED's evidence is
thin.
3 gentle i.e. the sweet air makes our sense gentle.
An example of rhetorical prolepsis, where effect is
placed before cause (Lexicon, Appendix 1.8). Foakes
compares 3.4.76.
4 temple-haunting i.e. associated with houses
of worship. Compare 'Yea, the sparowe hath founde
her an house, and the swallowe a nest for her, where
she maie lay her yong: even by thine altars, o Lord of
hostes, my King, and my God' (Ps. 84.3, Geneva).
At Duncan's death, 'temple' will mean both 'cra-
nium' and 'house of worship' (see 2.3.60-1 and
2.3.6m).
4 martlet A swift, but used also of the swallow or
house-martin (birds which build nests (8) attached
to the walls of buildings). Peter M. Daly, 'Of
Macbeth, martlets, and other "fowles of heauen" ',
Mosaic 12, 1 (1978), 32-8, shows that martlets and
related species were common emblems of 'prudent
trust' and 'harmony in the realm', F'S 'Barlet' may
be an unusual error for 'marlet', which OED
Martlet2 2 lists as a variant of 'martlet'; elsewhere, F
prints 'the Martlet' which 'Builds . . . on the out-
ward wall' (MVTLN 
1140-1).
4 approve confirm; attest; commend (as at Ant.
5.2.149).
5 mansionry 'mansions collectively' (OED
Mansionry, citing only this (emended) line and an
allusion from 1876, but plausibly suggesting an er-
ror for 'masonry'). Schàfer treats 'mansionry' as
Shakespeare's neologism.

vation from the birds' fertility (which gives them
their symbolic value) to their number (which vali-
dates the castle's 'pleasant' and 'heavenly' aspects).
Regarding 'most' as 'relatively trite', Brooke retains
'must', interpreted as 'are resolved to' and 'are
obliged to'.
9 haunt usually remain, habitually resort.

ously polite exchange by remarking how he some-
times finds troublesome others' well-meaning

respect and affection, over which they have taken so
much 'trouble'.
13-15 Herein . . . trouble Duncan turns a self-
deprecating compliment: Lady Macbeth should
learn from the king's example to ask God to reward
Duncan for the effort she makes and to thank
Duncan for providing the onerous occasion. Shake-
speare's nobles make such comments often; see Ado
1.1.96-103 and WT 5.3.3-8.
14 yield reward, recompense.
16-17 In . . . single For the mathematical lan-
guage here, see p. 26 above.
16 twice . . . double Lady Macbeth continues
the language of duplication and multiplication be-
gun by the Captain (1.2.37-8), continued by the
sisters (1.3.33-4, 4-I-I0)> and soon to be used by
Macbeth (1.7.12).
17 single weak, simple, undemanding. The word
continues the text's playing with singleness (unity,
integrity?) and doubleness (show, not substance?);
for Lady Macbeth, or for the play, doubleness may
be more valid or effective than singleness.
17 business exertion. In Elizabethan English,
the noun still retained its etymological content of
'busy-ness'; compare 1.5.66.
17 contend compete, vie (OED Contend 4).

Act 1, Scene 7
The opening SD makes this a nocturnal, interior
scene at Macbeth's castle; Macbeth has withdrawn
from the off-stage ceremonial dinner (see 29) to
some more private place. Compare 3.4, where the
audience sees another state dinner. For modern
productions and their sound effects, see p. 79 above.
Lady Macbeth's arguments encouraging her hus-
band to murder are similar to Beatrice's incitement
of Benedick to kill Claudio (Ado 4.1.255-336) and to
Dionyza's arguments justifying a murder she or-
dered (Per. 4.3).

A6V, appended to Thomas Dawson, The Second Part
of the good Hus-wives Jewell (1597)). Armstrong (p.
50) sees a parallel between the 'hierarchical relation-
ships' of sewer and servants, Duncan and subjects.
o SD.2 service something served as food; course of
a meal (OED Service sb 27D-C). The audience
would see dishes and other utensils. Compare A

0 SD.2 over the stage i.e. crossing silently from
one side to the other.
1-4 These tongue-twisting lines (compare
1.5.16-23) force the actor either to gabble or to
speak very slowly.
1-2 'So, while Duncan is . . . eating his "last sup-
per", Macbeth plays Judas, for to Judas Jesus at the
Last Supper said: "That thou doest, do quickly"
(John 13:27)' (Jones, Origins, p. 83).

erbs: 'The thing done has an end' (Dent T149) and

an allusion to this one) from Keats.
4 his surcease Duncan's death.
4 success prosperous achievement (OED Suc-

This is the play's fourth use of the word and recalls

word in Everett, pp. 96-^7.

4 that but if only.
5 be-all and the end-all the whole being and

Shakespeare invented the phrase and all subsequent
uses are quotations; 'end-all' (OED End-all: 'the
finishing stroke') seems to have a dialect existence
independent of this play.
6 bank and shoal sand-bank (or river bank) and
shallow, F'S 'Banke and Schoole' could also be mod-
ernised as 'bench and school'; OED defines 'bank'
(= bench) as referring to the seat of justice, the
mountebank's stage, or the rower's bench (OED
Bank sb1 1-3), but does not define 'bank' as 'school
bench'. 'Schoole' is a well-attested form of'shoal' in
the period. Although Macbeth soon mentions 'in-
structions' and 'justice' (which might be anticipated
in 'school' and 'bench'), the phrase seems more
likely to be a characteristic Shakespearean near-
redundancy, treating time as a river: Macbeth mo-
mentarily halts time's flow by standing on a shoal or
by grasping the bank. See Mahood, p. 24.

We'd jump the life to come. But in these cases,
We still have judgement here that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which being taught, return
To plague th'inventor. This even-handed justice
Commends th'ingredience of our poisoned chalice
To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued against
The deep damnation of his taking-off.
And pity, like a naked newborn babe

7 jump hazard (OED Jump » n , citing only this

see Booth, p. 170.
8 We always ('still') are punished here because we
only ('but') teach others (how to commit our own
crimes against ourselves).
10-11 NS compares 'auctorem scelus / repetit
suoque premitur exemplo nocens' ('upon its author
the crime comes back, and the guilty soul is crushed
by its own form of guilt' (Seneca, Hercules Furens
735-6, trans. F. J. Miller)). Howard Jacobson, SQ
35 (1984), 321-2, also cites 'saepe in magistrum
scelera redierunt sua' ('often upon the teacher have
his bad teachings turned' (Seneca, Thy estes 311,
trans. F. J. Miller)).
10 even-handed impartial.
11 ingredience 'ingredients' considered collec-
tively (OED Ingredience ia). Shakespeare's word is
obsolete, but modern 'ingredients' is inadequate;
'ingredience' appears in Shakespeare only here, at
4.1.34, and in Oth. Q (1622), sig. F3r (where Folio
Oth. reads 'ingredients').
12 double Macbeth now cites three relations of
trust. For two-ness and three-ness, see i.6.i6n.,
and p. 26 above.
14 as his host For social perceptions of a host's
duties, see Heal, chapters 2 and 3.
16-20 'Duncane was so soft and gentle of nature,
that the people wished the inclinations and manners
of these two cousins [Macbeth and Duncan] to have
beene . . . interchangeablie bestowed betwixt them'
(Scotland, p. 168b). 'The real Duncan was a weak
and worthless youth, who was put out of the way

because that was the best that could be done with
him' (White2).
16 this Duncan this king, who is Duncan (?).
While 'this' seems to particularise ('this Duncan
rather than another Duncan'), the word also implies
that the specific King Duncan who is Macbeth's
guest, kinsman, and king belongs to some larger
category (of men named Duncan or of kings). The
odd formula ('this Duncan') is a form of evasion
(compare Lady Macbeth's 'He that's coming'
(1.5.64)); it curiously lessens both Duncan's indi-
viduality and Macbeth's responsibility and there-
fore makes killing Duncan 
less terrible 
to
contemplate.
17 faculties powers, privileges (OED Faculty sb
11 a, quoting this line); 'authority delegated to him'
(Heath, p. 385).
18 clear innocent (OED Clear adj 15a, quoting
this line).
19 trumpet-tongued 'Duncan's virtues speak
with a trumpet-tongue on this matter of his murder'
(Sisson, 11, 194); the phrase modifies 'angels'.
21-5 See Brooks (pp. 21-46) for a classic defence
'of the relation of Shakespeare's imagery' here to
'larger symbols' and 'total structures' (p. 30) in the
play, and see p. 45 above.
21-2 newborn babe . .. heaven's chérubin
The alternative offered here between an image of
vulnerability ('babe') and one of heavenly power
('heaven's chérubin') at first seems confused, but
the compressed images join together Macbeth's fu-
ture opponents: Banquo's children, who will suc-
ceed to Scotland's throne (see 1.3.65), and the
near-divinely endorsed forces (see 4.3.240-2) that

comments: 'is Pity like the human and helpless
babe, or powerful as the angel that rides the winds?
It is both; and it is strong because of its very weak-
ness. The paradox is inherent in the situation itself;
and it is the paradox that will destroy the overbrittle
rationalism on which Macbeth founds his career.'

ness of Criticism, 1959, pp. 52-61.

the winds (see Milton, Paradise Lost 11, 516-18).
Renaissance maps often represent the principal
winds as cherubs with puffed cheeks, F'S 'Chérubin'

'chérubin look', Tim. 4.3.64); the contemporary
plural was 'chérubins' (as at 7^^5.1.62); modern
English follows Hebrew: 
'cherub' (singular),
'cherubim' (plural). Some editors choose a plural
form ('chérubins' or 'cherubim') because 'couriers'
(23) need plural riders, but the condensed meta-
phorical context makes those choices over-literal,
and one cherub might easily be imagined to have
charge of four winds.
23 sightless couriers invisible messengers; in-
visible means of transport, i.e. the winds which in-
visibly move the air from place to place. The echo of
'sightless substances' (1.5.47) makes plain the con-
trast of murder and pity, sin and dissuasion from
sin. Following Malone and others, Shaheen cites
'He rode upon the Cherubims and dyd flee [fly]: he
came fleeyng [flying] upon the wynges of the
wynde' (Ps. 18.10, Geneva).

24 blow sound; propel.
24 every eye every organ of sight; every person.
The second meaning is a synecdoche.
25 tears i.e. drops of compassion and the 'water-
ing' caused by a foreign object ('the deed') lodged in
'every eye'. Proverbially, 'Little rain lays great
winds' (Dent R16), and the line gains its power from
hyperbole: 'tears' become rain so powerful as to
'drown' the insubstantial and omnipresent wind.
25-8 I . . . th'other Two interpretations of
Macbeth's images have been offered: (1) continuing
the equine images of 22-3, Macbeth distinguishes
his intent to murder, which he imagines as an
unspurred horse, from his ambition to be king,
which he imagines as an eager rider who overdoes
his vault ('o'erleaps') and thus fails to land in the
saddle; (2) horse and rider together fall when the
pair fails to over-leap an obstacle. Catherine Belsey,
'Shakespeare's "vaulting ambition"', ELN 
10
(1972), 198-201, supports (2) and associates this
passage with medieval and later depictions of Pride
as a vaulting figure. In either case, the imagery
echoes Macbeth's response to the naming of
Malcolm as Prince of Cumberland (1.4.48-50).
More generally, see R. N. Watson, 'Horsemanship
in Shakespeare's second tetralogy', ELR 13 (1983),
274-300. Lady Macbeth's entrance interrupts the
speech, but the audience may supply 'side' (of the
imaginary horse or obstacle) as Macbeth's next (un-
spoken) word.
29 supped finished dining.
29 Why . . . chamber For the host to leave the
table before the chief guest had finished his meal
violated protocol; see 'how does your rising up be-
fore all the table shew? and flinging from my friends

Roaring Girl 3.2.6-7).

an elaborate, metaphorical description of drunken-
ness: 'hote wynes, and strong drinckes . . . fill the
braine with vapours' (Barrough, p. 11). See illustra-
tion 8, p. 46 above. Arnold Davenport (cited in
Schanzer, p. 224) over-rationalises the metaphors:
'the receptacle which should collect only the pure
drops of reason . . . will be turned into the retort in
which . . . undistilled liquids bubble and fume'. In
July 1606 (see p. 8 above), James VI and I and his
brother-in-law Christian IV of Denmark witnessed
a masque of Hope, Faith, and Charity, when 'wine
did so occupy' the actors' 'upper chambers' that
'most of the presenters went backward, or fell
down' (Letters and Epigrams of Sir John Harington,
ed. N. E. McClure, 1930, pp. 119-20).

an entrance; watchman (OED Warder sbl 1, quoting

Schanzer's conjecture 
('warden'

'warder') apparently assumes that Compositor A
misread a terminal suspension (in 'wardere' ?) and
ignores the classical, medieval, and early modern
understanding of memory's importance to moral
judgement and prudence (see Mary Carruthers, The
Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval

Act 2, Scene 1
The scene takes place in Macbeth's castle
(fictionally, at Inverness). It is liminal: sufficiently
out of doors for stars and moon to be looked for (1-
2), sufficiently indoors for Banquo to get ready for
'sleep' (7).

0 SD Torch-bearer F'S SD might mean that
Fleance holds a torch and precedes Banquo (him),

has passed? See OED Go D I I , quoting 'How goes

virtually repeats the question, 'What is the night?'
(3.4.126).

'There's thrift ("husbandry") in heaven, they have

see also: 'those golden candles fixed in heaven's air'

Roman republic. See The Rape of Lucrèce and
Iachimo's memory of 'Our Tarquin' when he pre-

advancing one foot, as far as he finds it safe, before

Act 2, Scene 2
The setting is somewhere in Macbeth's castle
that is private and that has imaginary access to other
parts of the castle. By keeping Duncan's murder
invisible, Shakespeare increases the audience's
complicity and excitement; compare the murdered
Duke Humphrey (2H6 3.2), carefully described and
possibly seen, and Jones, Scenic, p. 212.
1 That The indéfinition (what is That?) is pow-
erful; even after the audience realises Lady Macbeth
refers both to the grooms' drugged drinks and to
her own inebriated excitement at what is to come,
the doubt over 'That' lingers, and frightens.
2 quenched extinguished (as water would fire);
cooled (as in tempering forged metal). As in 1, Lady
Macbeth sees paradoxically antithetical conse-
quences of a single cause - a miniature instance of a
common event in the play (compare, for instance,
Banquo's and Macbeth's different reactions to the
sisters' prophecies in 1.3).
3—4 W. J. Lawrence, Shakespeare's Workshop,
1928, pp. 35-6, compares 'And when the Lambe
bleating, doth bid Godnight / Unto the closing day,
then teares begin / To keep quicke time unto the
Owle, whose voice / Shreikes, like the Bell-man, in
the Lovers eares' (Blurt 3.1.101-4).
3 owl Like the raven (1.5.36), the owl was a bird
of ill-omen. See 'The screeching owl bodes death'
(Dent R33); NS compares 'owls'. . . death-boding
cries' (The Rape of Lucrèce 165).
3 bellman night watchman. Dekker describes
' The Bell-man of London' as 'a man with a lanthorne
and . . . a long staffe . . . The Ringing of his Bell,

was not... to fright the inhabitants, but rather it
was musick to charme them faster with sleepe';
Dekker's narrator admits, 'The sound of his Voice at
the first put me in mind of the day of Judgement1

(Belman, pp. 109-110).
4 stern'st good-night i.e. the last good-night,
death.
4 He Macbeth, but the most recently mentioned
agents are the 'fatal bellman' and the 'owl' (3), mak-
ing Macbeth impersonal and allegorical.
5 surfeited fed or filled to excess (OED Sur-
feited/»/»/ a 1, where this line is the earliest citation);
hence, sickened by over-indulgence.
6 This line probably requires contraction ('I've'
for 'I have') for the metre.
6 mock defy, set at nought (OED Mock v ic,
quoting 'fill our bowls once more; / Let's mock the

6 drugged poisoned. This line is the earliest cita-
tion under OED drug v1 1 (Schàfer).
6 possets Drinks made of hot milk, liquor, and
spices (a delicacy).
7-8 Lady Macbeth imagines a contest, or an
allegorical play, in which abstract figures (Death
and Nature) fight over the grooms' lives and
consciousnesses.
7 That So that.
8 SD For the daggers, see 51. Fiissli (Fuseli) re-

9-10 Lady Macbeth's assumption that Macbeth
has failed may reflect her own irresolution (12-13)
or may indicate that she has mistaken Macbeth's
voice for that of one of the grooms (see her question

(13)).
10-11 th'attempt. . . Confounds us i.e. mur-
der attempted but not accomplished defeats us. F'S
punctuation says that the attempt to kill Duncan,
rather than the killing itself, will defeat the
Macbeths' aims; Globe changed the punctuation
to show that Lady Macbeth fears being known as
having attempted regicide without accomplishing
it.
11 Hark Listen, pay attention. Lady Macbeth
interrupts herself, starting at some real or imaginary
sound, perhaps of crickets (15), perhaps her hus-
band's footsteps.
12-13 Had ... done't Compare Lady Mac-
beth's assertion about infanticide (1.7.54-8 and n.).
With other monarchical theorists, James VI and I
stressed the identity of king and father (see e.g. True
Lame, pp. 62 and 74); Duncan's murder violates
multiple bonds, many taboos.

eyes.
23 sorry painful, grievous; wretched, worthless.
24 Does Lady Macbeth refer to Macbeth's
bloody hands, the bloody daggers, his hands and the
daggers, or does she merely dismiss her husband's
fear? Dessen ('Problems', pp. 155-6) suggests that
she does not realise Macbeth has mistakenly re-
turned with the daggers until 51 and links this 'not-
seeing' with her earlier failure to recognise Macbeth
(13), but it seems more likely she is taking her hur-
dles one at a time, first her husband's debilitating
fear, then the problem of replacing incriminating
evidence.

30-1 Capell (Notes, pp. 11-12) argues that
'List'ning their fear' should end a sentence rather
than begin one, but F'S punctuation, a colon before
'Listning' and a comma after 'feare', tends against
Capell, and his choice produces a weak following
sentence, 'I could not say "Amen" / When they did
say "God bless us".'

speak the formulaic word that would free him spir-
itually so that he could join in the grooms' prayers.
Claudius, also a regicide, in Ham. 3.3.38-72 medi-
tates on his need for contrition, strives to pray, but
gives up despairingly: 'My words fly up, my
thoughts remain below' (Ham. 3.3.97). Compare
Vittoria's horrific dream: 'I trembled, and yet for all
this terror / I could not pray' (Webster, White Devil
1.2.248-9).

38-43 There is no way of telling how much of
this passage (or of 44-6) is quoted speech, and an
audience is unlikely to hear fine discriminations;
altogether, 38-43 is 'a formal apostrophe to Sleep'
(Brooke) in the manner of The Rape of Lucrèce (e.g.
764 ff. on 'comfort-killing Night'). Clarendon com-
pares Seneca, Hercules Furens 1065-81, an apostro-
phe to sleep that includes the phrases 'vanquisher of
woes, rest of the soul, the better part of human
life . . . peace after wanderings, haven of life, day's
respite' (trans. F. J. Miller).

40 sleeve Part of a garment covering the arm

twisting a thicker thread (OED Sleave sb 1, quoting
this line as its first figurative use). An audience can-
not hear the difference between 'sleave' and 'sleeve',
and the play's clothing imagery prompts us to un-
derstand 'sleeve'.

quotes this line as figurative, citing also Chaucer's

'diminution' (OED Bate sbl i and sb1 2, respec-
tively). This latter ironic possibility is attractive, but

superstition that a murdered 
body, such as
Duncan's, bled afresh in the presence of the mur-
derer (see R3 1.2.55-61); Lady Macbeth is not,
technically, Duncan's murderer, but she is an ac-
complice and therefore equally guilty in contem-
porary criminal law. Here, therefore, she may be

Macbeth immediately speaks (unconsciously? com-
pulsively?) the hackneyed 'gild'/'giltV'guilt' pun

deception, royalty with murder. For red-gold sub-
stitutions, see 'golden blood' (2.3.105) and 'My red

lels (Sophocles, Catullus, Seneca) and perhaps
some sources; see Muir 2.2.59-62 n. Steevens
notes earlier English uses of the metaphors: 'And
made the greene sea red with Pagan blood'
(Anthony Munday, The Downfall of Robert, Earl of
Huntingdon, ed. John Meagher, MSR, 1965, line
1880) and 'The multitudes of seas died [dyed] red
with blood' (Munday and Henry Chettle, The Death
of Robert, Earl of Huntingdon, ed. John Meagher,

precedent. See e.g. Jasper Hey wood's translation of

stain' (Dent W85, citing Ado 4.1.140^); 'What if
this cursed hand / Were thicker than itself with

knocking at the gate is heard, and it makes known
audibly that the reaction has commenced; the hu-
man has made its reflux upon the fiendish; the
pulses of life are beginning to beat again' (De
Quincey, x, 393). J. W. Spargo argues 'the Jacobean
audience recognized in Macbeth [2.2] a crescendo of
three ominous portents of death: (1) the wolfs
howl; (2) the owl's screech; (3) the knocking at the
gate' ('The knocking at the gate in Macbeth, an essay
in interpretation', in Adams Memorial Studies, ed.
James McManaway et al., 1948, pp. 269-77; quota-
tion from p. 277. Spargo associates the knocking
with the sounds of those who searched houses for
victims of the great plague of 1603; see 4.3.167-
75 n.
69 south entry southern entrance (to the castle
or, later, 'palace' - 3.1.48, 3.3.13). The south was
often holy and the north devilish in folklore, but
Shakespeare elsewhere associates the south with
disease and sickness; see 2H4 2.4.363, Tro. 5.1.18,
Cor. 1.4.30, Rom. 1.4.103, Cym. 4.2.349.

73 night-gown informal clothing, dressing-

gown. Most Elizabethans slept naked, and 'night-
gowns' were worn outdoors and on such occasions
as church services and executions (Linthicum, pp.
184-5). Shakespeare, however, associates 'night-
gown' with semi-privacy and the bedchamber.
Compare: 5.1.4; jfC 2.2.0 SD; Ado 3.4.18-19, where
'night-gown' is a contemptuous description of a
very grand garment; Oth. 4.3.16 and 34, where
Desdemona's 'nightly wearing' and 'night-gown'
seem to be the same; King Henry's early-morning
meditations and meeting with his advisers '*'« his
night-gown' (2H4 3.1.0 SD); Enter the ghost in his
night gowne (Ham. QI (1603), sig. G2v).
73 occasion circumstances; chance.
74 watchers persons who stay awake at night,
night-watchers {OED Watcher c, quoting this line
as its second example).
76 To know . . . my self i.e. consciousness of
murder could best be borne if I lost my identity (a
quibble, perhaps, on Dent K175, 'Know thyself).
Upton (p. 177) paraphrases: 'To know my deed!
No, rather than so, 'twere best not know myself.'
The implicit claim is that Macbeth as he was and
murder are psychologically incoherent; awareness
of murder will require a new 'self. DeFlores asserts
that Beatrice-Joanna, having ordered a murder, is
recreated by her action: 'Y'are the deed's creature'
{Changeling 3.4.137).

Act 2, Scene 3
For the scene division here, see Textual Analysis,
p. 249 below. The scene begins at the castle's gate,
moves to some public, probably exterior, space from
which Macduffis led to the 'door' (42) of Duncan's
apartments, but eventually it is necessary to move to
the 'hall' (127), although the 'parley' (75) would
most naturally be held at the gate or from the
castle's battlements. The action here permits the
actor playing Macbeth to wash the blood from his
hands and to change costume. The Porter's
speeches were omitted by Davenant, Garrick,
Kemble and others. Capell praised the part (Notes,
p. 13) as 'masterly in it's way, and open to no objec-
tions but such as lye against all comic mixture with
things serious', and Coleridge (p. 103) condemned
it as non-Shakespearean. The Porter's part is now
considered a fine stroke of realistic allegory and dra-
matic pacing (Harcourt). Bradley (p. 314) sees a
similarity with the asp-bearing clown of Ant. 5.2.
Lady Macbeth's part has often been cut from this
scene; see p. 69 above, n. 4.
1-2 porter of hell-gate doorman at the entrance
to hell (imagined as a castle). Wickham, 'Castle',

discusses classical elements in the Porter's charac-
ter, speech, and function. See Supplementary Note,
p. 241 below, and illustration 9, p. 50 above.
2 old frequent, too much.
3-13 
In 
ancient 
comic fashion 
(compare
Launcelot Gobbo, MV2.2.1-32), 
the Porter speaks
both parts in a series of imaginary dialogues with
'some of all professions' (15) as they arrive in hell
(13-14), but stops when cold (14) and consciousness
sober him. Bradley (p. 437 n. 2) noted that the pat-
tern of the Porter's comic review of near-allegorical,

imaginary persons is virtually the same as Pompey's
listing of prisoners he has met ('Master Rash',
'Master Caper', et al.) in MM 4.3.1-19.
3 i'th'name of Beelzebub 'We should surely
expect him to say "in the name of my master" or
possibly "in the name of Macbeth"; but, since
Macbeth has just murdered Duncan, "in the name
of Belzebub" or "in the devil's name" is just as
appropriate' (Wickham, 'Castle', p. 42).
3 Beelzebub A popular devil-name, one of the
few found in the Bible (Brooke).
4 Come in time This is a good time for you
to arrive. NS's emendation is 'brilliant' (Muir), but
unnecessary. Qi673's reading, which Staunton un-
wittingly accepted and Harcourt (p. 394) guessed, is
almost as clever, making the farmer, a person whose
livelihood depends upon the seasons (= 'time'),
grammatically parallel with the equivocator (9-10)
and the tailor (12), but the rhetorical pattern (ad-
dresses to new arrivals in hell) has not yet been
established.
5 napkins handkerchiefs (to wipe the 'sweat'
caused by hellfire and perhaps the result of
the 'sweating tub', a supposed cure for venereal
disease).
6 th'other devil The Porter cannot remember
the name of another devil (Muir).
7 Faith By my faith (a mild oath).
7 scales pans (of a weighing device; here the
'scales' of justice).
8-9 for God's sake A common oath, but the
phrase may refer specifically to Jesuit priests'
equivocal oaths to preserve their lives from political
reprisal while also maintaining their faith ('for
God's sake'); see 26 n.

11-12 stealing out of a French hose Possibly a
joke about tailors' skimping on fabric in men's gar-
ments ('hose'), but fashions changed quickly, and
'French hose' were both loose and tight at various
times in the early modern period, making theft dif-
ficult or easy to detect, as the case might be
(Brooke); for analogous details of changing fashions
in breeches, see Dekker (and Middleton), The Roar-
ing Girl 2.2.71-82. The phrase may also be sexual
innuendo: 'tail' (of'tailor') = vagina; 'hose' = cod-
piece = penis. Precisely what (the theft, the penis)
was 'stealing out of (escaping, becoming visible)
is equivocal. Blackfriars suggests a pun, stealing/
'staling' (= urinating), which would anticipate the
Porter's other major interest.
12 roast your goose heat your iron (in the
flames of hell). 'Goose' was a tailor's long-handled
iron and also a slang word for 'prostitute', a source
of venereal disease, the 'French pox' for which a
sufferer roasted literally (see 5 n.) and spiritually (in
hell). See also n - i 2 n . above.
15-16 primrose . . . bonfire Shakespeare ap-
pears to have invented the phrase 'primrose path' as
a contrast between the easy and attractive pleasures
of sin and the consequences of sin, 'th'everlasting
bonfire' of hell. Compare 'the primrose path of dal-
liance' (Ham. 1.3.50) and 'the flow'ry way that leads
to the broad gate and the great fire' (AWW 4.5.54.-
5). Compare 'roast your goose' (12 and n.).
15 primrose 'abounding in primroses' (OED
Primrose 5^ (a) 7), a pale-yellow wild and cultivated
flower, 'first-born child of Ver, / Merry spring-
time's harbinger' (TNK 1.1.7-8).

16 bonfire Etymologically, the word derives
from 'bone-fire', a pyre in which human or animal
bones were consumed.
17 remember the porter give me a tip (for
opening the gate).
17 SD.I The Porter here performs some action
fulfilling his function as gate-keeper.
20-1 The Porter's lines are apparently prose, but
like other prose passages in the play they have an
iambic rhythm.
20 carousing celebrating, revelling, drinking.
20 second cock second crowing of a rooster (i.e.
a measurement of time before watches and clocks
were common). Compare 'the second cock hath
crowed, / . . . 'tis three a'clock' (Rom. 4.4.3-4), a
comment that does not necessarily mean that 'the
second cock' = 'three o'clock', and 5.1.31.
21 great provoker of three things The Shake-
spearean clown's typical invitation, a half-riddle
that will, he hopes, catch the interest of a wealthy
interlocutor. 77V 1.5.1-9, 3.1.16-25, and AWW
1.3.39-50 are other instances.
22 With this question, Macduff accepts his rôle
as straight man.
23 Marry A mild oath (in full: 'By the Lady
Mary', 'By the Virgin Mary').
23 nose-painting i.e. the reddening of the sot's
nose. Lady Macbeth angrily dismissed the painted
face and its effects (2.2.57-60).

away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be
an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it
sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him and dis-
heartens him, makes him stand to and not stand to. In con-
clusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie,
leaves him.

tioning. For contemporary beliefs about witches
and their power to inhibit a male's sexual perform-
ance, see Dolan, p. 216. Provoking (or tempting)
and unprovoking (or warning) also describe the sis-
ters' words to Macbeth and Banquo in 1.3 since
those words provoke Macbeth to regicide but also
seem to promise that he will become king 'with-
out . . . stir' (1.3.143); those words promise much
to Banquo, who is not 'provoked' to regicide.
26 equivocator Someone who uses ambiguous
words; a prevaricator. OED's first citation is from a
text composed in 1599, Edwin Sandys's A Relation
of the State of Religion (first printed 1605 and later
reprinted as Europae Speculum), where the word is
applied to Jesuits and their doctrine of mental reser-
vation. That doctrine permitted one to express vir-
tual falsehoods in a verbally true form to satisfy the
speaker's conscience (Sandys, sig. K2v). See p. 5
above. Scot (xm, 15) uses 'equivocation' to describe
banal confidence games, perhaps through analogy
with rhetorical 'equivoque', the pun, as in 'strange
equivocation' (Webster, White Devil 4.2.34).
26-30 it makes . . . leaves him These lines
mingle bawdy (developing 23-5) with other
meanings.
26 makes . .. mars A proverbial expression
(Dent M48).
27 sets . . . on . . . takes .. . off advances . . .
withdraws. Besides the bawdy description of a
failed erection, the verbs could describe urging dogs
to attack and retreat (compare 5.7.2 and n.).

28 stand to set to work (with a pun on the erect
penis).
29 equivocates him in a sleep fulfils his lech-
ery only in a dream (Hunter).
29 giving him the lie '(1) deceives him (because
he cannot perform sexually as he promised); (2)
floors him (as in wrestling); (3) makes him urinate
(lie = lye)' (Hunter); (4) makes him lose his erec-
tion; (5) accuses him of lying (as Lady Macbeth did
Macbeth, 1.7.47-51).
31-3 I believe. .. his lie Macduff, the comic
feed here, reignites the multiple jokes of 29 when he
asserts that 'drink gave thee the lie last night' (31),
but the Porter's reply, 'it did . . . i'the very throat
on [= of] me' and 'I requited him for his lie' (32,
33), stresses the single meaning of deliberate decep-
tion, the meaning most pertinent to what the
Macbeths have done and are about to do. The pro-
verbial 'To lie in one's teeth' (Dent T268) meant
'deep, deliberate lying' (Folger).
34 took up my legs made me unable to stand
(because drunk); 'dropped' me (as a wrestler does).

38 stirring The repetition of 35 sounds awkward
unless (or until) it activates the metaphoric identity
of sleep (from which Macbeth is supposedly awak-
ened) and death (from which Duncan will never
stir). Compare 70.
38 Not yet This phrase 'implies that he
[Duncan] will [stir] by and by, and is a kind of guard
against any suspicion' (Whately, p. 34). Macbeth
might have answered 'No', and 'Not yet' also means
'No longer'; see p. 48 above.

changes as verse; like other episodes involving short
exchanges and action, this one contains stretches of

45 appoint order; purpose.
48-9 
Lamentings . . . screams . . . accents
These sounds are not articulate speech, but
inchoate, ominous sounds (like the 'obscure
bird's' clamour) that people interpret ('they say')
as 
'prophesying' (47, 49), just as Macbeth
(mis)interpreted the sisters' words in 1.3.
48 screams shrill, piercing cries. This line is the
earliest citation for this meaning under OED
Scream sb a (the next citation is from 1708), so the
earliest audiences may have understood the sounds
more specifically as the 'cries of certain birds and
beasts' (OED Scream sb b, where the earliest
citation is from 1513). See Textual Analysis, p. 248
below.
49 prophesying uttering strange things; an-
nouncing solemnly (White subst., citing 'And he
saide unto me, Prophecie thou upon these bones, &
speake unto them: Ye drye bones, heare the worde
of the Lorde' (Ezek. 37.4)). The word only equivo-
cally means 'foretelling' since the 'combustions' and
'events' are already 'hatched'.
50 dire combustion dreadful commotion; terri-
fying disorder.
50 events outcomes, consequences (OED Event
3a). Certain causes are 'New hatched' (51) and will
mature into 'events' in on-rushing 'time'. The
metaphor of hatching (a bird's birth) anticipates 5 1 -
2, but the birth of events-in-time recalls Macbeth's
soliloquy (1.7.4-5).

70 sleep, death's counterfeit The similarity of
sleep to death was commonplace. See Cicero, De
Senectute 80: 'Nihil morti tarn simile quam somnus'
(Nothing is more like death than sleep), cited by
Grey (11, 145) in reference to 2.2.41; 'O sleep, thou
ape of death' (Cytn. 2.2.31); Samuel Daniel's superb
poem beginning, 'Care-charmer sleepe, sonne of
the Sable night, / Brother to death, in silent darknes
borne' (Sonnet 45 in Delia (1592), sig. G3r); 'Sleep is
the image of death' (Dent S527).
72 great doom's image simulacrum ('image')
of the Last ('great') Judgement ('doom'). See next
note. Duncan's death reminds Macduff of the
Christian version of the end of time and of the
world; indeed, this moment seems metaphorically
the end of a world, just as Kent ('Is this the prom-
ised end?') and Edgar ('Or image of that horror?')

Countenance v 6, for which this line is the only
evidence). The word also means 'give tacit consent
to'. 'By a time-serving assent to Macbeth's election,
Banquo puts himself in a position of danger'
(Mahood, p. 131).
75 trumpet Presumably, 'trumpet' is a figure of
speech for 'alarum bell' (68), but the word jarringly
recalls 1.7.18-19 and probably recalls St Paul's de-
scription of the time when 'sleepers' (76), the dead
(see 70), will 'rise up' from their 'graves' (73) at the
Last Judgement (see 72 and n.): 'Beholde, I shewe
you a mistere. We shall not all slepe: but we shall all
be chaunged. In a moment, in the twynklyng of an
eye, at the last trumpe. For the trumpe shall bio we,
and the dead shall ryse incorruptible, and we shalbe
chaunged' (1 Cor. 15.51-2).
75 parley conference under truce. This military
term suggests that some of 'The sleepers of the
house' (76) are or will be at war, with themselves
and/or with those (Macduff, Lennox) who have
entered from outside the castle.

Our royal master's murdered.
LADY MACBETH 
Woe, alas.

What, in our house?
BANQUO 
Too cruel, anywhere.
Dear Duff, I prithee contradict thyself
And say it is not so.

MACBETH Had I but died an hour before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time, for from this instant,

There's nothing serious in mortality.
All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees

His silver skin laced with his golden blood
And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature,
For ruin's wasteful entrance. There the murderers,
Steeped in the colours of their trade; their daggers
Unmannerly breeched with gore. Who could refrain,
That had a heart to love and in that heart
Courage to make's love known?

99-100 A delayed and shocking announcement,
since Macbeth has been on stage for almost twenty
lines. Rowe's punctuation indicates that Macduff
interrupts Macbeth's speech.
100 Wherefore Why.
101 temp'rate temperate, restrained. This con-
traction and others (e.g. 'amaz'd') are needed for the
metre.
102 Loyal and neutral Maintaining allegiance
(to Duncan) and disinterested (toward the grooms'
apparent guilt).
102 No man No one. The language recalls
1.7.46-7.
103 expedition haste, speed. Compare 'the
speed of his rage' (Lear 1.2.167).
103 violent love A self-contradictory phrase;
compare 42n., 1.2.ion., 1.6.11-13.

105 silver white. See next note.
105 golden red (see 2.2.59 n.). Imagery of rich
metals (silver and gold) transforms Duncan's body
into a decorated 'temple' (61), or a garment 'laced'
with golden threads and streams of blood.

106-7 breach . . . entrance The underlying im-
age is of an opening or break ('breach') in a shore or
dike, letting in ruinous (sea)water, or of attacking
troops breaking into a castle or walled city: some
injurious force overcomes cultivation's or civilisa-
tion's boundaries. This complex image represents
Duncan's body as a devastated landscape, as
Macbeth's violated castle, and as the violated bonds
of loyalty and hospitality. Compare Banquo's
wounds (3.4.27-8).
106 breach opening, gap. The word's sound an-
ticipates 'breeched' (109).
108 Steeped Dyed. See 'Thence comes it that
my name receives a brand, / And almost thence my
nature is subdued / To what it works in, like the
dyer's hand' (Sonnet 111.5^7).
108 colours of their trade identifying marks of
their occupation.
109 Unmannerly breeched Indecently clothed
(NS). The image makes the daggers humans wear-
ing impolite or antisocial breeches (trousers) of
blood, but also puns on 'unmanly': to dress these
daggers in Duncan's blood is to act inhumanly, to
act as a man 'Who . . . is none' (1.7.47). Compare
'breach in nature' (106). A single suspended mark
of abbreviation differentiated 'Unmannerly' and
'Unmanly' in contemporary handwriting, and they
are easily confused.

46 Sirrah Slighting form of address by social

both Macbeth and the servant are familiar with the

physical distance Macbeth wishes to keep between
himself and his instruments.
49-50 T o be . . . safely thus To be king is noth-

'thus' urges the actor to some gesture (e.g. indicat-

50-1 Our . . . deep A complex clause with an
intransitive and a transitive meaning: 'fears' of
Banquo's quality and prophesied future penetrate
and adhere (= 'stick') in Macbeth, but as this
speech and the remainder of the scene show, those
fears will now, or soon, become active and 'stick' (=
penetrate, remain fixed) in Banquo (i.e. the whole
clause also means 'Our fears stick deep in Banquo').
See OED Stick v\ 4, and OED In prep 25.

both emphatic praise and an allusion to Banquo's
royal progeny predicted by the sisters in 1.3.

' T i s . . . safety 
Macbeth, 
admiring
Banquo's circumspect bravery, anticipates a coup
d'état (see i-ion.); the praise echoes 2.3.101-11,

dom and valour, 'reason' and 'violent love'
(2.3.103-4).

57-8 My . . . Caesar Macbeth compares himself
to the Roman general and triumvir Mark Antony,
who was defeated in the civil wars that ended the
Roman republic and inaugurated the Roman em-
pire, and compares Banquo to the historical
Octavian (Shakespeare's Octavius), later called
'Caesar' (58) Augustus, the victor in those wars.
Shakespeare devoted JC and Ant. to these events; in
the latter play, a Soothsayer warns Antony: 'Thy
daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is /
Noble, courageous, high unmatchable, / Where
Caesar's [= 
Octavius's and = Banquo's in
Macbeth's speech] is not; but near him, thy angel /
Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd' (Ant. 2.3.20-

3)-
57 genius tutelary spirit. Classical belief held
that every individual had a personal spirit (for good
or ill), variously named or translated as 'genius',
'daemon', or 'angel' (see quotation from Ant. in 57-
8n.). This word reinvokes the Porter's speeches in
2.3; see Allen for the complex Greek and Roman
meanings.

3.1.58 Macbeth
[164]

Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me
And bade them speak to him. Then prophet-like,
They hailed him father to a line of kings.
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,
No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
For them, the gracious Duncan have I murdered,
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man,
To make them kings, the seeds of Banquo kings.

sion, but 'hail' appears only in the Christian New
Testament, addressed four times to Jesus (by Judas
and the mocking soldiers at Calvary), once to Mary
at the Annunciation, and once (by Jesus) to the
disciples; see Matt. 26.49, 27-29> Mark 15.18, John
19.3, Luke 1.28, and Matt. 28.9, respectively. For
Shakespeare's association of 'hail' and 'all hail' with
betrayal, see 1.3.4611.

5) notices that this prophecy is in Scotland, but not
mentioned in 1.3, where it would have negated the
mystery of the sisters' equivocation.
62-3 fruitless crown . . . barren sceptre Re-
calling the sisters' predictions (see 58), Macbeth
laments that he has no children to inherit his crown
(it is childless = 'fruitless' (62)) and his 'sceptre',
the ceremonial rod of office and figuratively his pe-
nis (understood as the source of a 'son of mine'
(65)), is 'barren' (63), without an heir. Seeking to
rationalise the play's dialogue, critics have endlessly
worried over whether the Macbeths have (or have
had) children (compare 1.7.54-9 and p. 17 above,
n. 1). What matters here is neither numbers nor
family history but Macbeth's ambition and mental

anguish.

where Macbeth anticipates drinking the 'poisoned
chalice' of murdering Duncan, and 'I have drunk,
and seen the spider' (WT 2.1.45). The language
seems biblical, and editors have cited Ps. 11.6, Isa.
51.17, and Rom. 9.22-3, but none of those texts
seems particularly relevant, though the last includes
'vessel of wrath' and 'vessel of peace' in a very dif-
ferent context. Geneva glosses 'cup of his wrath'
(Isa. 51.17) as 'this punishement in the elect is by
measure . . . but in the reprobate it is ye just venge-
ance of God to drive them to an insensiblenes &

know the tilts annually commemorating Queen
Elizabeth's accession on 17 November.
73 champion challenge to a contest, bid defiance
to (so OED Champion v 1, with one other citation,
from 1821). This instance is the word's only use as
a verb in Shakespeare, but its uses as a noun suggest
the verb might mean 'fight for', 'uphold, support'
(OED Champion v 2 and 3, with earliest citations
from the nineteenth century). Therefore, as Foakes
and common sense suggest, Macbeth may expect
Fate to enter the lists against Banquo's sons and,
following the sisters' assurances, fight for Macbeth.

ofFaversham, is a former soldier.) Despite F'S desig-
nation, 'They are not yet murderers but, by their
own claim, ruined men' (Foakes).

this answer to affirm their pride, their injured merit,
their capacity for revenge; the claim echoes ironi-

We are resolved, my lord.

124-5 Masking . .. reasons Macbeth repeats
(see 119-21), but broadens, his motive for secrecy,
answering (as in 118) an unspoken objection from
the Murderers. Compare 1.5.50 and 61—4, 1.7.24,
and 3.2.46-50.
126 Though our lives First Murderer is pre-
sumably about to volunteer his and his companion's
lives to achieve Banquo's death.
127 Macbeth's interruption may indicate eager-
ness to get his plan under way, or impatience at the
Murderers' tedious responses to an offer they could
not refuse.
127-38 Your . . . anon F represents these lines as
a single sentence, marking off the various stages of
Macbeth's increasingly disjointed instructions with
colons after 'palace' (131) and 'work' (133), semi-
colons, and commas; modern repunctuation dis-
guises the tumbling phrases and discontinuous
thoughts of F.
128 plant position (here, 'hide').
129 perfect fully informed; best. See 107 and
next note.
129 spy o'th'time This phrase has not been sat-
isfactorily explained, especially since the essential
information of when and where is conveyed in 128
and 130-1, apparently making this line redundant.
Johnson thought 'spy' meant secret watcher, and he
identified the figure with Third Murderer (see 3.3.1

and n.). Other interpretations - e.g. ' "Spy," whose
proper sence is - espyer, is used here for - espyaP
(Capell, Notes, p. 16; compare Ritson, p. 75: 'the
very time when you are to look out for him') -
associate 'spy' (rarely used as a noun by Shake-
speare) with 'espial' (= observation), though OED
does not list one as a form of the other. MED Spy vl

133 rubs nor botches impediments or flaws.
This line is OED\ earliest citation for Botch sb1

135 The contradiction of'absence' and 'material'
is an oxymoron that recalls the paradox of 'nothing
is, / But what is not' (1.3.140-1).
135 absence death. The euphemism palliates the
demand that the murderers commit infanticide,
which Shakespeare elsewhere (e.g. jH6,John) rep-
resents as the most heinous possible crime.
135 material important, consequential.

wounder in danger1 (Capell, Notes, p. 16); the im-
portant point is that the snake's body is cut, but not
severed. See next note.
14-15 Shakespeare attributes gender to snakes,
adders, and serpents inconsistently, sometimes
making them male (JC 2.1.32-4, Shr. 4.3.177-8),
sometimes female (Tit. 2.3.35, MND 2.1.255,
AYLI 4.3.109), sometimes neuter (2H6 3.1.230).
Here, a snake is imagined as female, although meta-
phorically it represents only males (Duncan and his
sons, Banquo and his).
14 close rejoin, heal up (i.e. the wounded snake
will recover).
14 our poor malice Macbeth's (and Lady
Macbeth's?) 'malice', the murder of Duncan, is
'poor' because it is insufficiently violent; speaking
either as king ('our' = royal plural) or for husband
and wife, Macbeth seeks consolation for having
failed (as yet) to kill enough people (i.e. Banquo
and Fleance (see 36-8), perhaps Malcolm and
Donaldbain also).
16 Like 22, this is a metrically long line (both are
divided in F).
16 frame of things universal order. Compare
'glorious frame of heaven' (Tamburlaine, Part 1
4.2.10) and 'loose the whole hinge of things, / And
cause the ends run back into their springs' (Queens
136-^7); see next note.
16 both the worlds suffer earth and heaven be
destroyed. See OED Suffer v 9b, citing only this
line and Temp. 2.2.34-7, but 'suffer' = die at TGV
4.4.15-16 and MM 2.2.105-7, and compare 'Mix
hell with heaven' (Queens 135).
20 peace .. . peace The later Folios vulgarise

the line to avoid repeating 'peace', but 'place' is a
pallid word for a kingship gained through murder.
For a similar repetition, see 'Though change of war
hath wrought this change of chear' (Tit. QI (1594),
sig. B3r), where later texts read 'chance of war'.
21 on . . . lie The implicit image is of the bed as
a means or instrument of torture (OED Torture sb
ib), e.g. a rack.
22 ecstasy frenzy, stupor.
23 life's fitful fever i.e. life is a disease ('fever')
causing paroxysms or recurrent attacks (fits, hence
'fitful'). The phrase better describes Macbeth's
nightly shaking (19, 22) than it does anything we
know of Duncan's life. Compare 'Life is like an
ague' (Dent, PLED L252.11). This line is OED's
earliest citation for 'fitful' (Schàfer).
23 sleeps well Duncan has been sent to the
'peace' (20), the eternal sleep of death, but Macbeth
has 'murdered sleep' (2.2.45) f°r himself and many
others who remain alive. Compare 1.7.61-3 and the
ironies of'Soundly' (1.7.63).

means to misdirect Lady Macbeth (Macbeth is now

Macbeth's complicity by stressing Banquo's dan-
gerousness.

imagines Hecate as 'pale', appropriate for her other
manifestations as Luna and Diana, but 'black' suits
both night and Macbeth's invocation of evil to
come.
42 shard-born born in dung (so OED Shard-
born 0), but another meaning of 'shard' and F'S
spelling 'borne' permit the popular gloss, 'borne

OED rejects. Shakespeare elsewhere mentions 'the
sharded beetle' in contrast with the 'full-winged
eagle' (Cytn. 3.3.20-1), and Enobarbus ironically
describes Antony and Caesar as 'shards' to
Lepidus's 'beetle' (Ant. 3.2.20); those contexts do
not resolve the meaning here, which may be a quib-
ble (Muir) on 'born' and 'borne'.

And the crow makes wing to th'rooky wood;
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,

'droop and drowse' (52)). Macbeth imagines the
beetle's soporific sound as the ringing of bells
(= 'peal') that mark night's and sleep's arrival.

sound') continues the imagery ('hums' and 'peal') of

45 chuck Affectionate nickname derived from
'chick' (chicken); compare 'my dearest love'
(1.5.56). See Supplementary Note, p. 243 below.
46 seeling sewing; blinding. 'Seeling' is a techni-
cal term from falconry: the sewing together of a
young bird's eyelids to condition it to accept the
hood necessary for training. Compare 1.5.49-51. A
metaphor from the validating of a written document
by applying metal insignia to hot wax, 'sealing', is
perhaps present; compare 49; 'Death's second self
[sleep], that seals up all in rest' (Sonnet 73.8);
Mahood, pp. 38-9, on the wordplay of 'deed',
'seeling'/'sealing', and 'pale' (both 'colourless' and

only use of 'scarf as a verb.
47 pitiful full of pity, compassionate.
49 bond contract, legal commitment; moral obli-
gation. Banquo's 'bond of life' (Rj 4.4.77), his very
existence, keeps Macbeth 'pale' (50); to 'cancel' that
bond is to kill Banquo, but the phrase embraces all

the moral, social, and political obligations (bonds)
so far violated. See 4.1.83 and n.

(Spenser, 
The Shepheardes Calender (1579),
'March', 115-16)), but the 'fog and filthy air' of 1.1

possibility.

51 rooky filled with rooks. The earliest citation
under OED Rooky a1 (Schâfer). The word has occa-

for the same bird; (3) 'crow' could also distinguish
the 'carrion crow' (Corvus Corone) from the 'rook'
( Corvus frugilegus).

contributed to this line.

Act 3, Scene 3
The location is exterior and nocturnal, some dis-
tance (12-13) from the entrance to Macbeth's
castle, now his 'palace' (13). As 3.4 will show more
largely, this scene contains reminders of the social
order and customs Macbeth is destroying: the hos-
pitality of the 'timely inn' (7); the practice ('so all
men do') of approaching the castle on foot (11-14;
see n.); the homely mention of the weather (18).
1 'But' indicates that the Murderers enter con-
versing; presumably First and Second have been
questioning Third Murderer, whom they did not
expect.
1 SH THIRD MURDERER Critics have speculated
on his identity: Ross, Macbeth (G. W. Williams,
'The Third Murderer in Macbeth', SQ 23 (1972),
261, raises strong theatrical arguments against this
possibility), and Destiny have been proposed (see
Muir), but NS reasonably suggests 'Macbeth, ty-
rant-like, feels he must spy even upon his own cho-
sen instruments.' Third Murderer's presence also
inserts tension into a necessary but predictable
scene; see Martin Wiggins, Journeymen in Murder:
The Assassin in English Renaissance Drama, 1991, pp.
77-8-
2-4 He . . . just 'He' is momentarily ambiguous
- Macbeth or Third Murderer? - and then is re-

solved when it becomes clear Third Murderer has
brought the 'direction' Macbeth promised on
'where to plant yourselves' (3.1.128). For a similarly
significant confusion of pronouns, see 1.2.20-2 n.
3 offices duties. A grim echo of 2.1.14: soon
social duty will again turn to murder.
4 just precisely, exactly.
4 stand take position; hide.
6 lated belated, overtaken by night (Hunter).
7 timely opportune.
8 I hear horses The sound of hoofbeats was
common in the Tudor and Stuart theatre; NS cites
W. J. Lawrence, Pre-Restoration Stage Studies,
1927, p. 217. For more hoofbeats, see 4.1.138-9; for
other horses, see 1.3, headnote.
9 SD Banquo calls to the grooms who will cool the
horses while their riders walk to the castle (see 11-
14).
9-11 The other expected guests have already ar-
rived. The Murderers serve as macabre butlers or
doormen to Macbeth's feast.
1 1 - 1 4 These lines explain the absence of horses
on stage and make more plausible the Murderers'
successful attack, since they assault two persons on
foot rather than on horseback. See 1.3, headnote.

horses).

Act 3, Scene 4
The audience must imagine a formal banqueting
space, perhaps the 'hall' (2.3.127). The dialogue
(especially 1, 4-5) seems to stipulate a throne (see
5 n.). See the description of King James in Parlia-
ment (Parliamentary Diary of Robert Bowyer, ed. D.
H. Willson, 1931, p. 185) and Andrew Gurr, 'The
"state" of Shakespeare's audiences', in Marvin and
Ruth Thompson (eds.), Shakespeare and the Sense of
Performance, 1989, esp. pp. 162-8, 174-^7. Macbeth
might first escort Lady Macbeth to the throne and
then join the lords at 4. Speaking from the throne,
or moving from it, Lady Macbeth recalls Macbeth
to his duties as host at 32-7, and she certainly enters
the main acting area at 53 when she intervenes to
explain Macbeth's behaviour. The visual contrast
between new royal status and old (?) com-
panionability, followed by Lady Macbeth's urgent
movement from throne to 'society' (4), emphasises
the Macbeths' insecurity and the fragility of the
order they seek to maintain or impose. See also ion.
Jones, Origins, pp. 26-8 and 79-83, discusses the
scene's possible sources in Suetonius's Life of
Claudius and two plays from the Corpus Christi
cycle known as Ludus Coventriae. This scene is the
last in which Macbeth and Lady Macbeth appear
together; see Appendix 1, pp. 255-6 below.

o SD.I Banquet prepared i.e. a 'banquet' placed
on stage (presumably some conventional stage-
representation). While a Jacobean 'banquet' might
be a light collation of elaborate sweets, this one
seems to be a state dinner (another available mean-
ing): 'our great feast' (3.1.12); 'a solemn supper'
(3.1.14); 'our feast' (3.1.29). See 1.4.56^

the centre (the 'midst') of the side facing into the

37 SD Editors have moved the Ghost's entrance
closer to the moment it is first recognised in the
dialogue (before 48), but F'S location is theatrically
feasible, making 40-4 simply but effectively ironic
and allowing the Ghost time to enter and to sit in a
place that fills the table but is not in Macbeth's line
of sight. Forman (11, 338) saw the actor playing
Macbeth 'standing up to drincke a Carouse to'
Banquo, 'And as he thus did . . . the ghoste of
Banco came and sate down in his cheier behind
him.' For the ways of enacting the Ghost's en-
trance, see Stanley Wells in Biggs, pp. 65-7.

where Macbeth identifies the ceremony's structure
- he toasts the lords, then the absent Banquo - and
the lines (91-2) during which the action of toasting
- first Macbeth to the lords, then all to Banquo,
then each lord to the others - takes place.

thy voyce, and with her fethers shall she bewray thy

(124) would be stories revealing a hidden murderer.

folktale, the 'Tell-Tale Bird', or to classical legend.

violation of who and what I am arises from a nov-
ice's fear. 'My strange and self-abuse' is most
plainly Macbeth's perception of Banquo's Ghost,
which Macbeth now tries to dismiss as an hallucina-
tion. The grammar treats 'strange' and 'self as ad-
jectives modifying 'abuse'; 'strange' may therefore

have the resonances of uncanniness it had in 82 and
of self-alienation it may have in 112. See OED Ini-
tiate ppl a and sb ib, quoting only this phrase. Pro-
verbially, 'Use makes mastery' and 'Custom makes

wordplay on indeed/in deed at Ant. 1.5.14-16.

confusing for two reasons: the Lord continues to

Act 4, Scene i
The location of this scene is as doubtful as its
narrative connection with 3.6 (see Textual Analysis,
pp. 261-2 below). Hecate says it will be the 'pit of
Acheron' (3.5.15), and it is an outdoor scene (horses
gallop up at 139) and a place where the cauldron and
apparitions may exist, but also an interior ('come in,
without there' (134)), where a lock and knock may
be imagined (46), a place where Lennox and pre-
sumably other courtiers are within earshot. The
Padua promptbook stipulates the needed cauldron,
and Rowe identifies the scene as 'A dark Cave, in
the middle a great Cauldron burning'. The witches'
'cooking' inverts and contrasts with the banquet of
3.4 (see Knight, Imperial, p. 138, and Michael
Hawkins, 'History, politics and Macbeth', in Focus,
p. 166). Garrick, Macklin, and others developed
elaborate sets for this scene. On various theatrical
versions of Macbeth's behaviour here, see p. 79
above.

done (Newes, pp. 16-17); compare James's descrip-
tion of how the Devil causes witches 'to ioynt dead
corpses, & to make powders thereof (Daemonologie,

hair was a villain's mark; compare 'a shag-hayr'd
craftie Kerne' (2H6 TLN 1673), 1.2.13 ('kerns'), and
the nightmare vision of two Gunpowder plotters:
'Two Monsters skulles, which never plotted good, /
Grim, gastly, pale, shag-hayre, sulphured eyes . . .'
(Edward Hawes, Trayterous Percyes and Catesbyes
Prosopopeia (1606), sig. A3r); the adjective is also

used of villains in King Leir (1605), ed. W. W. Greg,
MSR, 1907, line 2277, and The Faire Maide of
Bristorv (1605), sig. EIV. Two anecdotes originally
told of Thomas Cromwell are conflated and applied
to Thomas More when he condemns one Falkner,
'a ruffiari with 'shag hair', to Newgate prison until
he cuts his hair (V. Gabrieli and G. Melchiori
(eds.), STM, 1990,3.1.46 SD and 3.1.105). F'S 'shag-
ear'd' has been modernised as 'shag-eared' and ex-
plained as the result of judicial punishment:
'convicted villains frequently had their ears slit'
(Brooke). Convicted individuals' noses were slit;
ears, however, were bored or cropped and not, ap-
parently, slit or slashed (so as to produce a gro-
tesquely shaggy appearance). See, for instance, the
punishment for vagabonds in the statute 27 Hen.
VIII c. 25 (1535) and L. O. Pike, A History of Crime
in England, 2 vols., 1873-6,11, 73 and 97-8. Phono-
logical evidence (Cercignani, pp. 233-5) cannot dis-
criminate between 'shag-eared' and 'shag-haired'
for F'S reading.
80 egg Contemptuous epithet for a young person
(OED Egg sb 2b, citing only this line and another
from 1835); the Murderer agrees with the prover-
bial 'An evil bird lays an evil egg' (Dent B376). Once
again, avian imagery links this moment with the
Son's earlier conversation and with all the ominous
and ironically positive birds of the play.

Macbeth's royal command, but the lines may also
reflect upon Macbeth's own degeneration and thus

Act 5, Scene 1
This scene occurs in Lady Macbeth's private
rooms, probably in the castle at Dunsinane (5.2.12).
Like Macduff, who lost 'His wife, his babes, and all
unfortunate souls / That trace him in his line'
(4.1.151-2), Macbeth here loses his closest relation
and dearest confidant. Shakespeare often employs
prose when a character who ordinarily speaks verse
becomes deranged; see Oth. 4.1.35-43. For a similar
scene in which a doctor observes a disturbed person,
see TNK4.3.
o SD DOCTOR OF PHYSIC Physician. The specificity
implies costume or props and distinguishes this ac-
tor from the common Elizabethan and Jacobean use
of 'Doctor' as a title for a cleric. Lady Macbeth's
condition is represented as a medical rather than a
spiritual one; she needs physical therapy, not the
exorcism a Roman Catholic (but not a Protestant)
clergyman might claim to offer. See 64 n., and Tex-
tual Analysis, pp. 262-3 below.
0 SD WAITING-GENTLEWOMAN Personal at-
tendant who is 'gentle', not 'common'. In the Jaco-
bean court, the queen's personal attendants were
aristocrats; in Shakespeare's imagined courts, the
attendants' ranks are often unclear.

Macbeth 5.1.20

GENTLEWOMAN Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon her, unlock
her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it, after-
wards seal it, and again return to bed, yet all this while in a
most fast sleep.
DOCTOR A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the
benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery
agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances,
what at any time have you heard her say?
GENTLEWOMAN That, sir, which I will not report after her.

5 fold In early modern practice, a letter-writer
usually folded or creased a sheet of paper to form
the left- and right-hand margins of the text-area
before writing the letter itself; once the letter had
been completed, the sheet was folded several more
times to create its own 'envelope', a blank outside
upon which directions for its delivery were written.

Macbeth sees nothing (22) even though, uncannily,
'her eyes are open' (21).
18 The Doctor's realistic question (why does a
sleepwalker need light?) leads to an eerie inference:
awake or asleep, Lady Macbeth evidently fears the
dark. Unlike her famous predecessor, Hannah
Pritchard, who emblematically indicated the 'spot'
(30) by looking at her palm (see the illustration
reproduced in 'Macbeth in the twentieth century',
TQ. 1, 3 (1971), 21), Sarah Siddons set down the
taper so that she could mime hand-washing at lines

one has the power or authority to hold the Macbeths
responsible; compare her assurance before the mur-
der: 'Who dares receive it other' ( 1.7.77). Rowe2 and
most later editors change F'S punctuation to create a
more straightforward question: 'what need we fear
who knows it, when none can call our Power to

account -'; Rowe apparently assumed that the ques-
tion mark after 'fear' was superfluous, although
Q1673 retains F'S punctuation and Da venant com-
promises with 'what need we fear? who knows it?
There's none dares call our Power to account.' F
often includes more question marks than modern
conventions demand (see e.g. the collation for
1.3.130, 133), yet these lines make a difficult
but appropriate sense, and I have retained F'S
punctuation.
33-4 Y e t . . . him Lady Macbeth's surprise de-
pends upon the conventional assumption that age-
ing dries the blood and diminishes its movement;
see 'Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine'
(Ado 4.1.193) and 1.5.41-2n. The flat, almost disin-
terested, phrasing - 'who would have thought' -
and the neutral reference to Duncan, who earlier
reminded her of her father (2.2.12-13), a s 'the old
man' suggest Lady Macbeth's despair, a guilty
helplessness represented as sleepwalking and very
different from her energetic action in 1.7, 2.2, and

64 More needs she... physician i.e. she is
beyond medical help and requires spiritual counsel.
The line rests upon proverbial comparisons:
'Where the Philosopher ends, the Physician begins;
and he ends . . . where the Divine begins' (Samuel
Purchas, Purchas his Pilgrimes (1619), sig. 2Siv as
quoted in Dent, PLED P252.11, 'Where the
Philosopher ends the physition begins'). When
Bardolph reports that Falstaff is 'In bodily health',
Poins replies, 'Marry, the immortal part needs a
physician, but that moves not him: though that be
sick, it dies not' {2H4 2.2.103-5).
66 The Doctor anticipates that Lady Macbeth
might commit suicide (a conventional literary con-
sequence of the Christian sin of despair, or loss of
belief in God's grace), as Malcolm later suggests she
did (5.9-37-8).

for the proverbial 'One may think that dares not

Act 5, Scene 2
This scene is located in Scotland, where the na-
tive nobles await the arrival of the joint Scottish and
English army, and represents the first action against
Macbeth's tyranny, although 3.6 and the end of 4.3
anticipate it. For analysis of the final battles, see

speare emphasizes the role of Macbeth and his iso-

Macbeth 5.5.31

Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle,
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing.

19 petty small; hence, 'trivial, insignificant'. The

to figurative, from tiny steps to the journey's
pointlessness.
20 syllable smallest portion, merest trace. Com-
pare 4.3.8.
20 recorded written; told, narrated; recollected,
remembered (OED Record vl 9a, 8a, 4, respec-
tively). Given the atemporal mood of the speech, its
sense of being out of or beyond time, Mason's gloss
(p. 151) seems right: 'not only the time that has been,
but that also which shall be recorded'.
22 Out, out, brief candle Compare Lady
Macbeth's 'Out. . . Out' (5.1.30) and her taper
(51-15 SD).
23-5 Jones {Origins, p. 280) compares Seneca's
description of'this drama of human life, wherein we
are assigned the parts which we are to play so badly';
Seneca then contrasts the actor's humble circum-
stances and the royal parts he plays: 'Yonder is the
man who stalks upon the stage with swelling port
and head thrown back. . .' (Seneca, Epistle 80.7,
trans. R. M. Gummere).
23 walking shadow Grey (11, 154) cites biblical
passages where the brevity and insubstantiality of
human life are compared with a shadow: 1 Chron.
29.15, Job 14.2, Ps. 102.11, and Eccles. 8.13, for
example. Compare also 'Life is a shadow' (Dent
L249.1) and the lines Chapman derived from Pindar
via Plutarch and Erasmus, 'Man is a Torch borne in
the winde; a Dreame / But of a shadow, summ'd

with all his substance' (Chapman, Bussy D'Ambois
1.1.18-19).
23 poor player bad actor. For similar contempt,
see the 'strutting player, whose conceit / Lies in his
hamstring' (Tro. 1.3.153-4).
24 frets chafes, worries. The underlying theatri-
cal metaphor suggests that the player's willingness
to adopt a feigned passion makes him lose his in-
dividuality. Clarendon compares the taunting
'Stamp, rave, and fret' (3H6 1.4.91) addressed to
the captive Richard of York, and Dent (F672.1,
SS19, SS21) records combinations of 'fret', 'fume',
'stamp', 'stare', and 'rave' as common satirical re-
sponses to boasting, 'raging', bravado, and the like
treated as theatrically overdone.
24 stage i.e. life. Proverbially, 'This world is a
stage and every man plays his part' (Dent \v882); see
Jaques's speech beginning 'All the world's a
stage . . .' (A YLI 2.7.139-66).
25-6 It is a tale / Told Compare 'For when
thou art angry, al our dayes are gonne; we bring our
yeeres to an ende, as it were a tale that is tolde' (Ps.
90.9), prescribed for the burial service by the Book
of Common Prayer; the same psalm is the source for
2.4.1. There may be a pun on 'told'/'tolled' (a bell

pected (= 'our hope'). Macbeth now recognises the
effective difference between the sisters' ambiguous
prophetic speech and his own ambitious hope. See
5-3-27 n.
23 yield thee coward surrender yourself as a
coward; state (or concede) you are a coward. On the
second meaning compare 'to yield myself/ His wife

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES

I.I.O SD WITCHES A hint of the witches' early costuming appears in a Jacobean satire: 'my
Lady . . . holdeth on her way, perhaps to the Tyre makers Shoppe, where she shaketh out her Crownes
['coins', but punning on the 'crown' of the head] to bestowe upon some new fashioned Atire, that if we may
say, there be deformitie in Art, uppon such artificall deformed Periwigs, that they were fitter to furnish a
Theater, or for her that in a Stageplay, should represent some Hagge of Hell, then to bee used by a Christian
woman . . .' (Barnaby Rich, The Honestie of this Age (1614), sigs. B3v-4r). Wardrobe records from 1602
mention 'a wi[t]ches gowne' (see Henslowe, p. 218) as if it were a conventional garment, and by 1634, a
witch's - even, perhaps, a Scottish 'weird' sister's — costuming may have become a theatrical convention. In
The Late Lancashire Witches, a mother panders to her daughter's social aspirations: 'He . . . weare as fine
clothes, and as delicate dressings as thou wilt have me', and the daughter scornfully describes the mother's
present garb: 'Is this a fit habite for a handsome young Gentlewomans mother . . . you look like one o'the
Scottish wayward sisters' {Lancashire, sig. C2v).
Productions have represented the witches as comic and ridiculous (see p. 68 above), as young and
beautiful women (see e.g. one of Goethe's Weimar productions, discussed in Simon Williams, Shakespeare
on the German Stage: 1586-1914, 
1990, p. 95, and Bryan Forbes's production (Old Vic, London, 1980)), as
hideously masked figures, and in many other ways. The 'weird sisters' derive from the three classical Fates
(see Supplementary Note to 1.3.30), who were often represented in early modern graphic art as an old, a
middle-aged, and a young woman; see David Acton's catalogue entry for Pierre Milan's 'The Three Masked
Fates' (after Rosso Fiorentino) in Cynthia Burlingham, Marianne Grivel, and Henri Zerner (comp.), The
French Renaissance in Prints, 1994, pp. 298-300. Roman Polanski's film, Macbeth (1971), and Trevor Nunn's
1976-8 RSC production and the Thames Television production based on it (directed by Philip Casson,
1978; broadcast 1979), partly follow this pattern in representing the sisters.
1.2.0 SD.2 This direction seems to mean either that actors enter separately (e.g. from doors at the back
of the stage) to indicate joint arrival at a new location, or that one group (mentioned first) enters to find
another already present. This latter type of direction is common in Thomas Middleton's plays, uncommon
elsewhere (Brooke, p. 58, citing unpublished work by R. V. Holdsworth). .

In addition to this example, meeting occurs in five other SDS in Shakespeare's works:
Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecate. {Macbeth TLN 1429-30/3.5.0 SD)
Enter Bast, and Curan meeting. {Lear Q (1608), sig. D3V.1/2.1.0 SD)
Enter Varro's man, meeting others. {Timon TLN 1117/3.4.0 SD)
Enter three Senators at one doore, Alcibiades meeting them, with attendants. {Timon TLN 1255-6/3.5.0 SD)
Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another. {H8 TLN 2377/4.1.0 SD)
Remarkably, of these examples only the one from Lear his not been challenged as non-Shakespearean: the
Hecate passages in Macbeth may be Middleton's (see Textual Analysis, pp. 256-9 below); the first six scenes
of Act 3 of Timon are now generally considered to be by Middleton (see e.g. Textual Companion, p. 501); Act
4, Scene 1 of H8 is thought to be by John Fletcher, Shakespeare's collaborator on that play (see Cyrus Hoy,
'The shares of Fletcher and his collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher canon', SB 15 (1962), 71-90,
especially 80-1, and Textual Companion, p. 618).
Whether Macbeth Act 1, Scene 2 is partly or entirely by Thomas Middleton, then, it seems likely that the
opening direction is, or imitates, his. With meeting, Middleton always places an actor or actors on stage
before the entrance of one or more other actors; thus, early stagings of Macbeth probably placed the
wounded messenger on stage and directed the king's company to enter to him.
1.3.30 weïrd This word does not appear in F. The characters called 'witches' in the SDS name
themselves 'sisters' (see 1.1.0 SD n.), and Macbeth so names them (3.1.58). They are thrice called 'weyward'
(Compositor A: TLN 130, 355, and 596) and thrice 'weyard' (Compositor B: TLN 983, 1416, 1686). OED

Macbeth 
[240]

(Weird a) says 'weyward' 'was no doubt due to association with wayward', an appropriate, if less colourful,
adjective. 'Weird' in various forms does occur, however, in texts Shakespeare and his audiences either knew
or could have known. From at least 1400, Scottish texts apply 'weird sister' to the three classical Fates, the
Parcae (see OED Weird a 1); by about 1420, Andrew of Wyntoun begins to domesticate these figures -
making Hhe weird sisters' (emphasis added) into 'weird sisters' - when he writes that Macbeth 'saw thre
women by gangand' in a dream: 'And thai three women than thocht he / Thre werd sisteris like to be' (The
Original Chronicle, ed. F. J. Amours, 6 vols., 1903—14, iv, 274—5). The fanciful Scotorum historiae (1526 and
1575) of Hector Boethius (or Boece) calls these beings 'the fates' and 'prophesying nymphs': 'Verum ex
eventu postea parcas aut nymphas aliquas fatidicas diabolico astu preditas fuisse interpretatum est vulgo'
(Book 12, f. 258r; sig. K2r) and later on the same page, 'the sisters' ('sorores'). And John Bellenden's Scots
translation—adaptation of Boece, The Hystory and Croniklis of Scotland (?i54o), reports that Macbeth and
Banquo 'met be ye gait thre wemen clothit in elrage [eldritch] & uncouth weid [weed = clothing]. They were
Jugit be the pepill to be weird sisteris' (f. i73r) and uses 'weird sisteris' three further times on the same page.
The 1531 manuscript of Bellenden's translation here reads 'thre weird sisteris or wiches'; see The Chronicles
of Scotland, ed. R. W. Chambers and E. C. Batho, 2 vols., 1938-41, 11, 150. Aware of both Boece and
Bellenden, Holinshed (Scotland, pp. 1700-1713) says these beings resembled 'creatures of elder world' and
were thought to be 'the weird sisters, that is (as ye would say) the goddesses of destinie, or else some nymphs
or feiries'.
While no one of these antecedent texts needs dictate the language of Macbeth, they are united in calling
the beings who prophesy to Macbeth 'weird' rather than 'wayward'. Beside spellings unique in F - neither
'weyward' nor 'weyard' is a recorded form of wayward - other evidence suggests that the compositors of
Macbeth would not have hesitated to set some more recognisable form of 'wayward' if that were the word
they thought they saw in the play's manuscript. Compositor B, for instance, uncomplicatedly set 'wayward'
(3.5.11), and he and Compositor A had no difficulties elsewhere in F: Compositor A set both 'way-ward' (sig.
B5r/TG^TLN 211) and 'waiward' (sig. \\y/Ado TLN 472), and Compositor B set 'wayward' four times (sig.
HÔr/Err. TLN 1284; sig. CT,T/R2 TLN 786; sig. n r / / ? j TLN 494; sig. tt$r/Oth. TLN 1927). Compositor B's
consistent 'wayward' elsewhere in F makes his equally consistent 'weyard' in Macbeth seem a deliberately
composed unusual word rather than an accidental and unique form of wayward, or (pace Cercignani, p. 365)
an historical pronunciation of it. Moreover, when Compositor B met this word in the first column of Folio
Macbeth that he composed, he would have had few preconceptions about the play and little familiarity with
his copy's handwriting and is therefore likely to have set what he thought was before him. Compositor A also
met the word he set as 'weyward' in his first stint on Macbeth; it first occurs three lines after 'Wrackt, as
homeward he did come' (TLN 127), and a kind of'compositor's antonymy' - 'homeward'/'awayward' - may
have influenced him toward 'weyward'. Such errors may be much rarer than the substitution of synonyms,
but they do apparently occur (see Textual Companion, pp. 519 and 526, on Lear Q (1608) 16.10 and 24.166,
respectively). Later Folios leave Compositor A's spelling unchanged, but modify Compositor B's: TLN 983
is normalised to A's spelling ('weyward'), while TLN 1416 and 1686 become 'wizard' and 'Wizard' (or, in F4,
'Wizards'), respectively. Although 'weyard' and 'wizard' might be confused in Secretary handwriting,
'wizard' may be a 'correction' from Holinshed where the phrase 'certeine wizzards' (Scotland, p. 174b;
'haruspicibus' in Boece, f. 26ir) occurs in the text paralleling Macbeth TLN 1416 and 1686.

The question of what F'S compositors saw and therefore what modern word or words F'S 'weyward' and
'weyard' might represent cannot be decided. Adopting 'wayard', as A. P. Riemer does (The Challis
Shakespeare, 1980), is unsatisfactory not least because it is a nonce-word, but 'wayard' also contradicts F and
almost 200 years of earlier Scots and English Macbeth-narratives. In the Everyman edition of Macbeth
(1993), John Andrews retains F'S two spellings, believing them to be the same word with double meaning,
modern 'wayward' and archaic 'wyrd' (see his i.3.3on.), but that decision substitutes commentary for
modernisation. Post-Macbeth uses of 'wayward', as in 'the Scottish wayward sisters' (Lancashire, sig. C2v;
compare Hunter, New, n, 162), or of 'weird', as in Peter Heylyn's equation of 'Witches' with 'Weirds'
(Microcosmos, 2nd edn (1625), p. 509), have no evidentiary value. Thus, there are reasons to doubt that
Compositor A mis-set manuscript 'wayward' as 'weyward' and reasons to believe that Compositor B's
'weyard' is an honest effort at what modern English represents as 'weird'. In sum, and especially in view of
Compositor B's practice in Macbeth and elsewhere in F, Theobald's emendation of'weyward' and 'weyard'
to 'weird' seems a plausible and metrically justifiable change.

[241] 
Supplementary notes

1.3.89 sight F reads 'fight', but Compositor A could have easily confused 'fight' and 'sight' in Secretary
handwriting; moreover, the ligatured types fi and /*, each cast on a single body, are also easily confused since
they were side-by-side in the compositor's case. The traditional reading is 'fight', printed in Cam. and
Furness without comment; Oxford and Brooke print 'sight', also without comment or collation.

2.2.8 SD Dorothea Tieck's German translation of Macbeth has Macbeth enter oben {above) to deliver this
line, exit, and enter again to speak 14; Oxford and Brooke attribute this staging to E. K. Chambers's 'Red
Letter Shakespeare' (1904) where it does not appear, although Chambers does adopt it in his 'Warwick
Shakespeare' edition of Macbeth (1893). Other editors have instructed Macbeth to speak 8 within (i.e. off-
stage). All seek to explain Lady Macbeth's apparent ignorance that it is her husband who speaks line 8 (see
9-10 n.). One effective staging (accepted here and compatible with F'S directions) construes her puzzlement
as the consequence of the stage's (imaginary) darkness: two anguished actors, uncertain of each other's
identity but in full view of the audience, deepen the scene's terror. Dessen, 'Problems', pp. 154-6, usefully
discusses F'S staging here, although it is also possible that F prints the SD too early.

2.3.0 SD a PORTER The apocryphal gospel of Nicodemus recounts Jesus's release of Adam, Eve, Moses,
and others from limbo; this episode (the 'Harrowing of Hell') appears widely in medieval art and verse, and
in all four of the surviving Corpus Christi dramatic cycles which often represent hell as a castle-like location,
occasionally with Porter-like speakers. Several Middle English poems on the subject specify a devil-porter
(compare 14: 'I'll devil-porter it no further'), as do, apparently, several graphic works (see e.g. British
Library MS. Additional 47682, f. 34, upper image — the horn used there by one devil atop the battlemented
limbo identifies him as a porter (W. O. Hassall, The Holkham Bible Picture Book, 1954, p. 139) — and
illustration 9, p.50 above). Although none of the Corpus Christi cycle plays clearly identifies a devil as a
porter, John Hey wood's interlude, The Four PP (first printed about 1545), includes a lying contest in which
the Pardoner describes a visit to hell where he encounters a 'deuyll that kept the gate' [i.e. a devil-porter],
and the Pardoner 'at laste / Remembred hym [this devil]. . . For oft in the play of Corpus Christi [i.e one
of the cycle plays?] / He hath played the deuyll at Couentry' (Adams, p. 378). See further, Jones, Origins,
p. 32, Wickham, 'Castle', and, for a summary of previous interpretations, Anne Lancashire in Mirror, pp.
223-41, especially pp. 224-7.

2.3.74 In the Folio, this and the following line appear as:

To countenance this horror. Ring chc Bell.
Bell rings. Enter La<Ljm
Ladf. What's the BufincfTe i

'Ring the Bell' repeats MacdufPs earlier order, 'Ring the Alarum Bell' (68), and F'STLN 835 is immediately
followed by Bell rings. Enter Lady. Brooke, echoing Keightley, says, 'since MacdufPs order in . . . [68] has
not yet been obeyed, his impatience is intelligible'. A widely accepted, if over-realistic, objection was offered
by Lewis Theobald, who omitted the phrase 'Ring the Bell': 'if the Bell had rung out immediately, not a
Word of What he [Macduff] says could have been distinguish'd. Ring the Bell, I say, was a Marginal
Direction in the Prompter's Book for him to order the Bell to be rung, the Minute that Macduff ceases
speaking.' Theobald continues with a metrical argument: 'we may observe, that the Hemistich ending
Macduffs Speech ['To countenance this horror'], and that beginning Lady Macbeth's ['What's the busi-
ness?'], make up a compleat Verse'. Theobald's realistic argument and Shakespeare's largely unrealistic
practice coincide: sound effects frequently follow a character's speech no matter when they have been
commanded. I agree, therefore, with Theobald's view and have deleted the phrase.
2.3.83 SD Capell removed Ross from F'S SD {Enter Macbeth, Lenox, and Rosse) and explained {Notes, 11,
13), 'he is no speaker [in 2.3], went not out with them [i.e. Macbeth and Lennox at 67 SD], [and] enters too
immediately [at the start of 2.4] in another place after what should be his exit in this'. In fact, F'S 2.3 provides
no exit for Ross by name; he could leave in the final Exeunt (139 SD) or, as several editors have suggested,
he could help Lady Macbeth off-stage at 112 or 118, though even that action is debatable. If Ross does exit
at the scene's end, it would be most unShakespearean for him to begin the next scene; even an exit with Lady
Macbeth would allow him an unusually short time off-stage to help the audience understand the gap of time
and change of place between 2.3 and 2.4. Ross is a mysterious character; he has, for instance, been proposed

Macbeth 
[242]

as Third Murderer (see 3.3.1 SH n.), and his political allegiances are particularly unclear (in 4.2, for instance,
he might be played as sympathetic to Lady Macduff or as Macbeth's agent ensuring that she and her
children remain unalarmed long enough for their murderers to arrive - a directorial choice Roman Polanski
seems to have adopted in his film (1971) of the play). Although Oxford retains Ross here because 'a "ghost"
[i.e. a mute character once intended to enter and perhaps to speak but forgotten by the playwright] seems
unlikely in a prompt-book', much, if not all, of his 'mystery' is probably the result of a script that theatrical
professionals tidied up as a matter of course without influencing the written copy for F. Editors do not have
such latitude, and it seems best to delete him here, especially since no actor will lose lines.

3.1.91-107 Although this speech at first seems a distended analogy (dogs and men are alike in their
variety, some good, some bad), Macbeth's rhetorical tactics contradict his criminal purposes. The varied
plenitude of dogs and men to which Macbeth appeals represents a universal and social order he has violated
and now seeks to violate further; the premise of varied quality leads as easily to negative valuations of the
men as to positive; 'bounteous nature' has given each a different 'gift', but Macbeth's analogy holds that
nature has given his hearers the 'gift' of destroying nature. Some of the inherent moral contradictions appear
in 'Not i'th'worst rank' (102), which for Macbeth means 'capable of murder' and recalls such self-
contradictory phrases as 'Worthy to be a rebel' (1.2.10). This speech appeals to the men's pride in their
manhood and is, therefore, Macbeth's version of Lady Macbeth's earlier speech (1.7.35 ff.); her appeal and
her threatened contempt pivot on a comparison between herself and Macbeth ('had I so sworn / As you have
done . . .'), but her husband's speech weakly and self-defeatingly turns on the man/dog comparison and
promises the love of a man, Macbeth, self-described as 'sickly' (106).
John D. Rea proposed that this passage 'is probably taken from Erasmus' colloquy Philodoxus1 ('Notes on
Shakespeare', MLN 35 (1920), 378), where a few general, moralised analogies between human and canine
behaviour are mentioned. It seems more likely that Shakespeare here transformed matter from Dr John
Caius, OfEnglishe Dogges, the diversities, the names, the natures, and the properties, trans. Abraham Fleming
(1576). Fleming's delightful translation of Caius's Latin text (1570) is incorporated whole in Topsell, pp.
164—81, and matches Macbeth 3.1 in taxonomic rigour ('A gentle kind . . . A homely kind . . . A currishe
[kind] . . .'). John Caius, who gave his name to the Cambridge University college Gonville and Caius, as well
as (perhaps) to the French doctor in Wiv. (see Lord McNair, 'Why is the French doctor in The Merry Wives
of Windsor called Caius?', Medical History 13 (October 1969), 311-39), devoted a section of his book to'other
Dogges . . . wonderfully ingendered . . . The first bred of a bytch and a wolfe' (sig. F2r), that is, a 'demi-
wolf, the offspring of a dog and a wolf specified at 3.1.93 (see n.). Of this cross-breed Caius observes: 'we
have none naturally bred within the borders of England. The reason is for the want of wolfes, without
whom no such kinde of Dogge can be engendred.' Note, as a measure of its popularity, that Caius's book on
dogs attracted the attention of the king, as recounted in a famous anecdote: 'When King James passed
through this college [Gonville and Caius], the master thereof presented him a [book by] Caius "De
Antiquitate Cambridgiae", fairly bound; to whom the king said, "What shall I do with this book? give me
rather Caius "De Canibus" [i.e. OfEnglishe Dogges], a work of the same author, very highly praised, but
hardly procured' (Thomas Fuller, The History of the Worthies of England, new edn, P. Austin Nuttall, 3 vols.,
1840, 11, 490).

3.2.38 in them Nature's copy's not eterne Lady Macbeth asserts that Banquo and Fleance are not
immortal. So much is unquestioned, but the meaning of individual words has been disputed. The line may
mean that Banquo and Fleance are 'copies' of a natural pattern for the human body, or that they are
patterned after nature's model. More controversial is an interpretation most succinctly represented by
Joseph Ritson's note in Steevens3: 'an estate for lives held by copy of court rolV; this explanation refers 'copy'
to a form of common law possession of land called 'copyhold', one way in which a tenant occupied and could
bequeath land technically owned by his lord. Since some copyholds could be terminated by the death of the
tenant, critics were attracted to the legal interpretation of the line. An article by P. S. Clarkson and C. T.
Warren, 'Copyhold tenure and Macbeth, III, ii, 38', MLN 55 (1940), 483-93, has led Muir and Brooke to
reject this interpretation. Clarkson and Warren, however, depend upon a legalistic understanding of
Shakespeare, of Ritson, and of other editors, and ignore the fact that dramatists often used legal terms
loosely, as Clarkson and Warren themselves amply document in their magisterial The Law of Property in
Shakespeare and the Elizabethan drama, 1942. As in most legal arguments, the pros and cons of'copy' =
'copyhold' are complex, but they turn on (1) who is the lord and who the tenant and (2) how Macbeth

[243] 
Supplementary notes

understands his wife's remark. I suggest that Lady Macbeth's intervention forwards her husband's
thoughts: if Banquo and Fleance are tenants 'for life', their deaths (which her line prompts Macbeth to
consider directly) will terminate their tenure in 'Lord' Nature's land (i.e. in existence); they will die.
Clarkson and Warren consider this interpretation - 'Banquo and Fleance would be the tenants and Nature
would be the lord1) — but reject it because 'Macbeth then would have no right to terminate the tenure, and it
would be no comfort to him that Nature might at some time do so' (MLN 55 (1940), p. 493). The objection
is not pertinent. Macbeth's 'right' cannot be an issue; his wife invites him to consider murder, not some
action at the common law. Lady Macbeth's line, whatever interpretation we adopt, is no more than a
commonplace: people die. Reminded so starkly of this fact - indeed, virtually told that killing Banquo and
Fleance will relieve his scorpion-filled mind — Macbeth takes heart: 'There's comfort yet, they are
assailable.' Clarkson and Warren are probably right (Shakespeare gets his law wrong); yet they forget that
Shakespeare invokes legal language not before a court, the King's Bench, but for an audience that might
(must?) have had as vague, or as figurative, an understanding of legal terminology as he did. The main point
is that the law is to be broken - the common law, the law of land-tenure, the law of the Ten Commandments,
'Thou shalt not kill.'

3.2.45 chuck An aristocratic couple's use of such an endearment is quite unusual, at least in the drama.
Shakespeare elsewhere uses 'chuck' variously: four times (LLL 5.1.111 and 5.2.661, 77V3.4.113,//y 3.2.25)
humorously by a male character to males; three times (Oth. 3.4.49 and 4.2.24, Ant. 4.4.2) between husband
and wife or lover and lover. In a scene that may be John Fletcher's work, Theseus calls Hippolyta 'sweet
heart' (7WAT 3.5.148). Realistic and unromantic Crispinella rebukes her sister Beatrice who has called her
fiancé 'love': 'Prithee, call him not love: 'tis the drab's phrase; nor sweet honey, nor my cony, nor dear
duckling: 'tis the citizen terms' {Dutch Courtesan 3.1.129-31). For the contemporary English use of, and
controversy over, endearments, see Houlbrooke, p. 101, and William Gouge's pastoral rebuke to his
congregation over couples' public use of affectionate nicknames, including 'chick' [= 'chuck'] (A. C. Carter,
'Marriage counselling in the early seventeenth century: England and the Netherlands compared', in J. Van
Dorsten (éd.), Ten Studies in Anglo-Dutch Relations, 1974, p. 117), and compare 'You jig and amble . . . you
nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance' (Ham. 3.1.144—6).
3.6.6-^7 Q1673 lacks 'Whom you may . . . walk too late'; at the same point Davenant prints only 'Men
must not walk so late'. These omissions may have some particular topical origin, but the Restoration
evolution of 'night-walker' as 'prostitute' and 'ruffian' (see OED Night-walker) has a long history: 'night-
walking' had been a misdemeanour since 1331 (see 'Nightwalkers' in jfowitt 's Dictionary of English Law, 2nd
edn, ed. John Burke, 2 vols., 1977). See also 'night-walking heralds' (i.e. sexual go-betweens, Rj 1.1.72) and
'This is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm' (MWW 5.5.143-5). Shake-
speare's lines may have become unacceptably comic by 1673, or the omission may arise from a desire to
avoid even a hint of wrong-doing among the legendary ancestors (Banquo, Fleance) of James's grandson,
Charles II, king when Q1673 and Davenant were printed.
4.1.110 s D F'S dialogue contradicts its SD by giving Banquo, rather than the eighth king (118), the glass;
in F'S text, Banquo (or his ghost, or 'shadow') comes last (122-3), following the 'show' of eight kings, the last
of whom 'bears a glass' (118). Early revision and theatrical changes probably made the copy for F'S SD
inconsistent with its dialogue, and Cam.'s SD (following Hanmer) resolves the contradiction with the fewest
changes to F.

4.1.120 two-fold balls and treble sceptres Upon being crowned and on other formal occasions, the
monarch carries symbolic accoutrements (orb, sceptre); editors and critics have tried to link this line with
the historical circumstances of King James, monarch of both Scotland and England. NS quotes E. K.
Chambers: '[This phrase] can have nothing to do . . . with the triple style of King of Great Britain, France,
and Ireland, adopted . . . [by James I on] 20 Oct. 1604. The earlier English style was triple, and there were
no sceptres for France and Ireland. The "two-fold balls" must be the "mounds" borne on the English and
Scottish crowns, and the "treble sceptres" the two used for investment in the English coronation and the one
used in the Scottish coronation.' (A 'mound' is an orb of gold, often topped by a cross; mounds surmount
the Scottish and English royal crowns.) For 'balls', 'sceptres', and 'mounds', see illustration 12, p. 59 above.
The 'treble sceptres' may, however inaccurately, refer to England, Scotland, and Wales; in a letter to James
VI, Henry Percy, ninth Earl of Northumberland, foresees James's accession to the English throne as 'the
anexing of theas thrie kingdomms' and describes how James will integrate his Scottish subjects, 'to wnite

Macbeth 
[244]

[unite] the tuo nations . . . to make them one, as nowe england and walles are' (John Bruce (éd.), Correspond-
ence of King James VI. of Scotland, Camden Society 78 (1861), 53 and 56). In 1541-2, the Irish Parliament
and Henry VIII himself declared the English king, 'King of Ireland' (J. J. Scarisbrick, Henry VIII, 1968, pp.
424-5), and E. B. Lyle, 'The "twofold balls and treble scepters" in Macbeth', SQ 28 (1977), 516-19,
persuasively concludes that the spectral kings 'bear triple scepters in token of rule over Great Britain,
France, and Ireland, and double orbs signifying that Great Britain was formed by the union of Scotland and
England' (p. 519).
4.3.148 John Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, witnessed James touching for the King's Evil after divine
service on 19 September 1613:

When it [the service] was concluded, his Majesty stood up . . . immediately the Royal Physician
brought [the sufferers] who were afflicted . . . and bade them kneel down . . . and as the Physician had
already examined the disease (which he is always obliged to do, in order that no deception may be
practised), he then pointed out the affected part... to his Majesty, who thereupon touched it,
pronouncing these words: Le Roy vous touche, Dieu vous guery (The King touches, may God heal thee!)
and then hung a rose-noble round the neck [of the sufferer] . . . with a white silk ribbon . . . The
ceremony of healing is understood to be very distasteful to the King, and it is said he would willingly
abolish it...
(W. B. Rye, England as seen by Foreigners, 1865, p. 151).

Arthur Wilson's hostile account (History of Great Britain, 1653, p. 289) claims James's ceremonies were a
politic fraud: 'he [King James] knew a Device, to aggrandize the Virtue of Kings, when Miracles were in
fashion . . . though he smiled at it, finding . . . the strength of the Imagination a more powerful Agent in the
Cure, than the Plasters his Chirurgiens prescribed for the Sore\ For evidence of James's early (PSeptember-
October 1603) ambivalence about the ceremony, see F. David Hoeniger, Medicine and Shakespeare in the
English Renaissance, 1992, pp. 281 and 371 n. 14.
4.3.162 While the invention of the clan tartan lay two centuries in the future, Highland males (that is,
most of the cast of Macbeth) already had for Jacobean audiences a well-known and distinctive regional
costume:

Their habite is shooes with but one sole apiece; stockings . . . made of a warme stuffe of divers colours,
which they call Tartane: as for breeches, many of them, nor their forefathers never wore any, but a
jerkin of the same stuffe that their hose is of, their garters being bands or wreathes of hay or strawe,
with a plead about their shoulders, which is a mantle of divers colours, much finer and lighter stuffe
than their hose, with blue flat caps on their heads, a handkerchiefe knit with two knots about their
necke . . .

Nor, the English observer continues, is this costume restricted to the poor:

any man of what degree soever that comes amongst them, must not disdaine to weare it... if men be
kind unto them, and be in their habite; then are they conquered with kindnesse . . .
(John Taylor, The Pennyles Pilgrimage (1618), in Taylor, Works, 1630, p. 135)

Contemporary English dramatic representations of Scots almost always included the blue flat cap and a
short sword called a 'whinyard'.
5.3.19 Seyton Critics have frequently suggested that the name would have been pronounced and
heard as 'Satan'. Patten's explanation of why the Scots called the 1547 Battle of Pinkie, or Musselburgh, by
a different name supports the claim: 'Sum of them cal it Seton felde (a toune thear nie too) by means of a
blynd prophecie of theirs, whiche is this or sum suche toy, Betwene Seton & the sey [sea], many a man shall
dye that daye' (Patten, sigs. a7r-v), where 'sea', 'day', and the first syllable of'Seton' apparently rhyme. The
'prophecy' is very old: a version appeared in the fourteenth century (see The Romance and Prophecies of
Thomas of Erceldoune, ed. James Murray, 1875, pp. 34 ff.), and another is current in Prophesie (sig. A4r), a
volume originally published to mark the fulfilment of one of Merlin's most celebrated prophecies, the union
of Scotland and England. See also Nosworthy in Mirror, pp. 216-17, where he argues that Seyton = Satan
on internal evidence and notes the oddity of stressing 'Seyton', given the extreme rarity of proper names in
the play's dialogue.

TEXTUAL ANALYSIS

General editorial procedures

The First Folio (F) divides Macbeth into acts and scenes; editors have changed that
division in Acts 2 and 5 (see below), F'S divisions are recorded in the collation, along
with plausible editorial versions. In the dialogue, personal names (e.g. Fleans, Lenox)
and place names (e.g. Envernes, Fiffe) and their derivatives (e.g. Norweyan) have been
silently modernised (Fleance, Lennox, Inverness, Fife, Norwegian, respectively) un-
less the change affects the metre. Many uncontroversial modernisations have not been
included in the collation; for example, changes of F'S T (for 'ay'), 'He' (for TIP), and
'then' (for 'than') have not been recorded, and F'S 'Oh' and 'enow' become 'O' and
'enough' without note. Among the less obvious silent modernisations, F'S 'bad' (the
past tense of 'to bid') appears here as 'bade'; so, too, F'S 'ha's', 'do's', and 'Prey's', for
example, appear as 'has', 'does', and 'preys'. On the same principle, F'S various
spellings for the 'hautboy', a musical instrument which is not the modern oboe, have
been silently normalised. Fairly consistently, the Folio represents the syncopated -ed
in past tenses and past participles as -W, the stressed as -ed; in this edition, these
suffixes are represented as -ed and -id, respectively, and the collation silently treats
earlier editions as observing the same conventions.1 Similarly, other merely conven-
tional differences (archaic spelling, punctuation, etc.) between earlier editions and this
one are not noted in the collation. In this text, F'S italics for proper nouns have been
silently omitted, along with its archaic and merely conventional capitalisation; its
obsolete abbreviations (e.g. yu for 'thou' at 4.3.33/TLN 1852 and 5.3.57/TLN 2279) are
silently expanded. (Quotations from F in the collation are treated differently; see
below.) Folio Macbeth only once uses the apostrophe to mark a singular possessive
('Life's Feast', 2.2.43/TLN 696); elsewhere it does not distinguish among plural nouns
and singular and plural possessives. All such distinctions are editorial and for a
reader's convenience, since the differences would often be hard to hear in the theatre;
these editorial distinctions are not noted in the collation but doubtful instances appear
in the Commentary. Other uncontroversial, normalising, and modernising editorial
punctuation (of contractions, marks of exclamation, and vocatives, for instance) has
not been collated, but any changes of or additions to punctuation (e.g. quotation marks
and changes of address marked by dashes) that affect sense or theatrical delivery as I
understand them have been collated and usually are discussed in the Commentary.

1 Thus, at 4.3.34 the collation records Hanmer's edition as the first to replace F'S 'affear'd' with the different
word 'affeered', though Hanmer's conventions led him to print 'affeer'd', and the conventions used in this
edition did not appear until S. W. Singer's first edition (1826), where he prints 'affeered'; in my collation,
Hanmer is credited with the change, and Singer is unmentioned. Albrecht Wagner, Shakespeares
Macbeth . . . mit den Varianten der anderen Folios, 1890, meticulously collates F Macbeth with the later
seventeenth-century folios.

Macbeth 
[246]

Directions for a character to speak to another or aside are all editorial, and most
derive from eighteenth-century editions; such directions are placed within square
brackets and should be regarded with caution. Substantive changes and additions
to F'S stage directions appear in square brackets, and all are collated, but uncontrover-
sial modernisations like that made in the dialogue proper and the imposition of
New Cambridge Shakespeare series conventions (e.g. no final punctuation in entry-
and exit-directions, capitals for the names of speakers in entry-directions) are not
collated.
Most speech headings are silently expanded and normalised unless F'S ascription
might seem confusing (e.g. Mac. for Macduff, not Macbeth, at 4.3.102/TLN 1930), or
where there is a wide, local variation (as in the three different speech headings for
Si ward in the short Act 5, Scene 4) or where the assignment of a speech has been
changed or plausibly conjectured; in such cases, the collation records F'S reading and
any change or conjecture. Where F indicates a member of a category (witch, murderer,
apparition) by a number, the speech heading has been expanded (e.g. FIRST WITCH,
THIRD MURDERER, SECOND APPARITION) and the change collated. It has often been
suggested that as Shakespeare composed he sometimes thought (and wrote) of the
speakers not by name but by social status or familial relation, F'S speech headings
always refer to Duncan as King., to Malcolm as Mai. (or Male, or Male,), to Lady
Macbeth as Lady, (or La., La: or Lad.), to Lady Macduff as Wife., to her male child
as Son., and to Macbeth as Mac. (or Macb.); some or all of the implied patterns
and distinctions may be Shakespeare's.1 These speech headings have been norma-
lised: 'Duncan', 'Malcolm', 'Lady Macbeth', 'Lady MacdufP, 'Son', and 'Macbeth',
respectively.

Like the speech headings, the Folio's stage directions also reflect a professionally
abbreviated nomenclature: Lady Macbeth is once Macbeths Wife (1.5.0 SD/TLN 348),
once Macbeths Lady (3.2.0 SD/TLN 1151), at all other times, Lady; Lady Macduff is
Macdujfes Wife (4.2.0 SD/TLN 171 I); Duncan is always King. Such usages are nor-
malised here (e.g. as 'Lady Macbeth' and 'Lady MacdufP, respectively); the collation
records their first occurrence and, where appropriate, notes that they appear 'through-
out', as do similar collation entries for speech headings. At 3.1.10 SD/TLN 992, F reads
Enter Macbeth as King, and this theatrical direction (which indicates or implies cos-
tume, props, blocking, and the like) authorises the insertion of similar directions for
Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in Act 3, Scene 4. On several occasions (see the SDS at
1.2.44/TLN 66, 2.3.34/TLN 784, 2.4.20/TLN 949, 3.4.37/TLN 1299, 3.4.88/TLN 1363,
and 4.3.139/TLN 1968), the Folio contains so-called 'anticipatory' stage directions

1 Speech headings in Macbeth and their variants are listed in Marvin Spevack, A Complete and Systematic
Concordance to the Works of Shakespeare, 9 vols., 1968-80, vu (1975), pp. 753—5- The claim that type-
names or social or familial designations for characters derive from the author (rather than the theatre or
printing-house) appears in R. B. McKerrow, 'A suggestion regarding Shakespeare's manuscripts', Review
of English Studies 11 (1935), 459-65; it has been roundly trounced in Paul Werstine, 'McKerrow's

Textual analysis

signalling the moment an actor stepped on to the Globe's capacious stage or when the
book-holder alerted an actor to prepare to enter rather than the moment the actor
'entered' the dialogue or was noticed verbally by other speakers. Since many en-
trances, especially those of Banquo's Ghost in Act 3, Scene 4, have great theatrical
potential - a potential the reader may at least partly share with the spectator - I have
not moved F'S directions to their more 'regular' places according to modern stage
conventions.
Quotations from F in the collation retain original orthography (except for 'long' s)
and italicisation, with various forms of the ampersand represented as '&' and abbrevia-
tions silently expanded. Unless original orthography is relevant to the argument,
quotations from F elsewhere and from other sources follow modern conventions for u
and v, i and 7, and 'long' s even if, for example, the modern editions I cite preserve
original spelling. In these quotations, abbreviations are silently expanded, ampersand
forms appear as '&', and texts originally using black letter with roman or italic type for
emphasis appear as roman with italic for emphasis.

Copy for the Folio

The manuscript from which Folio Macbeth was printed probably originated in the
theatre, either having served as the promptbook for contemporary productions or
being a specially prepared transcript of such a promptbook. Regarding the former view
as 'beyond reasonable doubt', W. W. Greg noted particularly that 'the record of
entrances and exits is almost complete' and 'there is practically no inconsistency,
much less ambiguity, in the designation of the characters'.1 More minor features of F'S
text also support this view: for example, a theatrical instruction 'Ring the bell' has
apparently been incorporated in the text of Act 2, Scene 3 (see Supplementary Note
on 2.3.74, P- 2 4 J above), and numerous stage directions for sound and lighting, Oboes.
Torches. (1.7.0 SD), and supernumeraries, Drum(me) and Colours (5.2.0 SD, 5.4.0 SD,
5.5.0 SD, 5.6.0 SD, 5.9.0 SD), for instance, are professionally terse. The Folio is not,
however, flawless as a theatre script. Greg complains that two different stagings of
Macbeth's death seem to be conflated in F'S stage directions,2 and on at least one other
occasion (the end of Act 3, Scene 5, discussed below as an example of adaptation) two
inconsistent stagings seem to appear in the directions.
Whatever processes prepared F'S manuscript copy for performance or printing, or
the normalisation imposed by that printing itself, have removed most traces of any
putative Shakespearean spelling habits, and it seems most unlikely that his holograph
went to Jaggard's printing-house. Greg did, however, accept Richard Flatter's conten-
tion that the unique 'Banquoh* (1.2.34/TLN 54) represented Shakespeare's own version

1 Greg, p. 395; 'F'S copy may itself have been the prompt-book, or a transcript of it' (Textual Companion,
p. 147; see also p. 543). See also Gary Taylor and John Jowett, Shakespeare Reshaped 1606-1623,1993, 
pp.
46, 85, 87, and 240, where it is claimed that Macbeth is a scribal transcript that 'derives from a late
theatrical text' (p. 87). Some of the evidence for F'S copy is far from unassailable; early theatrical
professionals probably tolerated, or had to tolerate, more inconsistency (in SHS and SDS, for example) than
modern scholars imagine they did.

editorial and critical comment and theatrical practice.

Macbeth 
[248]

of Holinshed's spelling, 'BanquhoV Further, 2.2.15/TLN 667 and 2.3.48/TLN 805
contain two unusual spellings, 'schreame' and 'Schreemes', respectively. OED records
these forms only here and comments {OED Scream z;): 'In Shakespeare's [spellings]
. .. sch probably stands for (sk) after the spelling of words of classical derivation.'2

Whatever the merit of OED\ speculation - 1 suppose it refers to such classical names
as 'Moschus' - it has long been recognised that Shakespeare probably wrote some
other words beginning with s in an unusual way. For instance, the spelling scilens
(silence) occurs, so far as is known, only in the portion of the manuscript of The Booke
of Sir Thomas More supposed to be in Shakespeare's handwriting and eighteen times
(text and didascalia) in the quarto of 2H4 (1600), believed to have been set from
autograph copy or from copy that retained authorial spellings.3 Elsewhere, there occur
numerous unusually spelled proper names (which compositors might hesitate to nor-
malise): 'Sceneca' {Hamlet Q2 (1604), sig. F3, line 1, for 'Seneca'); 'Scicion' {Ant.
1.2.113, 114, 119, for 'Sicyon'); 'Scicinius' {Cor. 2.1.204 SD and Scicin. or Scici. in
some SHS, for 'Sicinius').4 Given this admittedly patchy evidence, it seems possible
that 'schreame' and 'Schreemes' in Folio Macbeth represent Shakespeare's own auto-
graph spellings.5

Scene division in the Folio

Shakespeare and other early modern English playwrights apparently composed their
plays in scenic units defined by location and time.6 A new scene begins when the stage
empties of actors, and the audience is asked to imagine that the following action takes

1 Richard Flatter, '"The true original copies" of Shakespeare's plays: outline of a new conception',
Proceedings of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society 7, part 1 (July 1952), 31-42; p. 36.
2 Although other parts of the words were gradually modernised, the unusual h disappears from 'schreame'
and 'Schreemes' only in F4 (1685); the compositors of Q1673 and F2 and F3 evidently felt the spelling
unusual enough to forbear changing it. The same may have been true of the F compositor when he read
his manuscript copy.
3 See Vittorio Gabrieli and Giorgio Melchiori (eds.), STM, 1990, 2.3.55 a n^ n.; Matthias A. Shaaber (éd.),
2H4, 1940, pp. 488-94; Giorgio Melchiori (éd.), 2H4, 1989, p. 189. A. C. Partridge, Orthography in
Shakespeare and Elizabethan Drama, 1964, p. 62, has, however, found very similar early printed and
manuscript spellings: 'scylens' and 'scilence'.
4 Hinman, 1, 380-1 and 383-4, treats the last spelling as characteristic of Compositor A, who set both
'schreame' and 'Schreemes', and the sc-forms of the proper names mentioned here are not unknown in
other contemporary works.
5 This argument naturally makes one suspect other words beginning sch- in Macbeth, particularly the
famous crux 'Banke and Schoole of time' (1.7.6/TLN 480), and might in that instance seem to support
modernising the crucial word as 'school' rather than 'shoal', the reading I adopt. The oddity of'schreame'
and 'Schreemes', however, lies in those spellings (like 'scilens') not having been found thus far outside
Shakespearean texts, though there are some near approaches; the spelling 'Schoole' for 'shoal' is well
documented elsewhere and represents a plausible scribal or compositorial choice. For other proper and
common nouns in sc- where contemporary orthography preferred 5-, see n. 4 above and Lee Bliss,
'Scribes, compositors, and annotators: the nature of the copy for the First Folio text of Coriolanus\ SB

6 The few surviving early modern English manuscript plays by professional playwrights exhibit all the
possible variations: no divisions marked, acts only marked, complete or partial act and scene division. For
comment and a tabular summary, see Anthony Munday, Fedele and Fortunio, ed. Richard Hosley, 1981,
pp. 68-73.

Textual analysis

place at a later time or in a new location, or both.1 Printed designations of scene
changes appear only sporadically in vernacular plays between Thomas Sackville and
Thomas Norton's Gorboduc (1565), divided into acts, and John Lyly's Mother Bombie
(1594), divided into acts and scenes; the practice becomes common in the first
decade of the seventeenth century.2 It is important to stress, however, that scene
divisions are a printed, not a theatrical, phenomenon. Where a printed text marks a
new scene, the stage will exhibit a blank, an absence of actors. The marking of scenes
and of acts (the grouping of scenes) is thus mainly a convenience for readers, for
devotees of print culture, and for those who require a succinct reference-system.3

What the reader experiences as marks on the page the spectator experiences as a
shifting of bodies and voices on the stage. Thus, and significantly for Macbeth,
editorial scene division affects readers very differently from the way the stage action
affects spectators.
Even though Elizabethan and Jacobean conventions for scene division seem rela-
tively clear, ambiguous cases do arise. Aside from Alexander Pope and a few others
who sought to impose a neo-classical system on the Folio's plays, editors have
plausibly altered Macbeth's Folio scene divisions only in Acts 2 and 5. Nicholas
Rowe, the first named editor of the play, and others have found F'S division of Act 2,
Scene 2, from Act 2, Scene 3, unnecessary, in part because the location does not
change from some vaguely imagined 'Macbeth's Castle'.4 Puzzlement over the setting
is understandable, because it is here unusually fluid, but the stage has emptied of
speakers, the customary indication of a scene-break, and F'S division makes readerly
sense.
The series of conflicts ending Act 5 has proved more controversial. As a coda to an
unconvincing argument that young Siward's body should remain on stage after his
death, Homer Swander claims that F'S Scena Septima (the last it marks in Act 5) is
'a clear, straightforward, efficiently theatrical unit', but that modern editors
'[u]nanimously . . . deform it, either enlarging it by joining it with Scene Six or (more

between sides that has marked Act V so far now speeds up, till the two blur into one victory and
one defeat.1

While I have chosen Hunter's alternative of 'more divisions' rather than 'none at all',
his view seems to me unassailable and theatrically neutral, since printed scene divi-
sions - any one, all, or none - need have no theatrical consequence whatsoever, and the
Folio's divisions are quite probably not Shakespeare's at all.2 The headnotes to Scenes
7, 8, and 9 and the Commentary on 5.7.14 SD.2 discuss specific local issues of scene
division in Act 5.

Compositors and the printing of the Folio

It is generally agreed that two compositors, customarily called 'A' and 'B', converted
manuscript Macbeth into printed Macbeth. Exigencies of early modern printing re-
quired the two compositors to set the text in an order different from the one we read.
This is the sequence: 1.1.0-1.3.103/TLN 1-210 (Compositor A); 2.3.66-2.4.IOVTLN
827-947 (A); 2.4.19-3.1.21/TLN 948-1006 (Compositor B); 3.1.22-77/TLN 1007-70
(A); 2.2.50-2.3.65/TLN 704-826, 3.1.78-3.2.37/TLN 1071-1195, 2.1.6-2.2.49/TLN
579-703, and 3.2.38-3.3.25/TLN 1196-1252 (A); 3.4.0 SD-3.4.45/TLN 1253-1310 (B);
1.6.21-2.1.5/TLN 457-578 (A and B); 3.4.46-3.5.5/TLN 1311-1435 (B); 1.4.50-
I.6.2I/TLN338-456(A);3.5.6-4.I.28/TLN 1436-1555 (B); 1.3.104-1.4.49/TLN 211-
337 (A); 4.1.29-134/TLN 1556-1685, 5.4.15 - Finis/JLN 2311-2530, 5.2.15-5.4.15/
TLN 2192-23IO, 4.3.224-5.2.14/TLN 2O7I-2191, 4.3.II2-223/TLN 1939-2070, 4.3.O
- I I I / T L N 1812-1938, and 4.1.135-4.2.82 SD/TLN 1686-1811 (B).3 After collating
over fifty copies of the Folio, Charlton Hinman (1, 300-1) found only six press-
corrections (changes made after some surviving pages were printed) in Macbeth; only
two (both on sig. nn2) are substantive. The collation records those two (at 4.3.156 and
4.3.215 SH).
Compositors made characteristic changes (or errors) in setting their copy.4 In plays
where the Folio was set from an earlier, surviving printed text, for example, it can be
shown that compositors sometimes omitted small or substantial amounts of text if they
had underestimated how much space would be required to convert their copy into
print. If they miscalculated in the opposite direction and allowed too much space for
transferring manuscript copy to print, compositors employed detectable techniques
for stretching their copy to fill the available space. And there are other typical flaws in
compositors' work. Each compositor mistakes characters' names in the first batch of
text he set. Not yet aware that the play's king is named Duncan, Compositor A did not

1 Hunter, p. 186.
2 Swander maintains (p. 150) that questioning the 'Shakespearean authority' of F leaves us 'as readers, in the
chaotic world of editorial disagreement'; indeed it does, but such questioning and the editorial redivision
that follows in no way restrict equally chaotic theatrical reshapings of the play's conclusion, and 'Shake-
spearean authority' is nebulous.

pp. xi-xii, and Textual Companion, p. 154.

compositors, Textual Companion, pp. 148-9.

[251] 
Textual analysis

set a comma in the entry SD for Act 1, Scene 2, and amalgamated the king and his elder
son: Enter King Malcome. Compositor B, similarly unaware that Lennox is a thane and
that Macbeth's wife is consistently referred to as Lady, treated two characters,
Macbeth's Queen (or Lady) and the Thane of Lennox, as one - Enter Macbeth as King,
Lady Lenox . . . (TLN 992) — in the first column of text he composed.1

In Folio Macbeth, however, the main difficulty partly created by A and B is the play's
lineation, its setting out of verse and prose and the regularity of its verse. Compositor
A 'had a regrettable tendency to rearrange normal blank verse into a succession of
irregular lines', while B 'had a tendency to set up prose as though it were verse'.2

Lineation in the Folio

Protesting against the rearrangement and rewriting of short and/or unmetrical lines,
especially by George Steevens, Charles Knight complained:

We admit that it will not do servilely to follow the original in every instance where the
commencement and close of a line are so arranged that it becomes prosaic; but on the other hand
we contend that the desire to get rid of hemistichs, without regard to the nature of the dialogue,
and so to alter the metrical arrangement of a series of lines, is a barbarism which ought to be
corrected as swiftly as possible. But when this barbarism is carried a degree farther, and the text
is daubed over after the fashion of a sign-painter mending a Claude, we hold that the offence of
republishing such abominations is a grave one . . . we proceed on our work of restoration.3

Since Knight wrote, the 'work of restoration' has come to seem less clear cut; critics
now admit a greater flexibility (or 'looseness') in Shakespeare's metrics, especially in
the latter half of his career, and recognise the influence of those (including Shake-
speare) who prepared the plays' manuscripts for performance and the compositors
who set those manuscripts in type.4 Most critics agree that the Folio obscures one
Shakespearean metrical practice, the sharing between two or more speakers of a single
iambic pentameter line. In the clearest cases, these shared lines represent a syntactical
or thematic unit. Since the late eighteenth century, editors have reproduced such units
typographically by indenting the words that complete the line.5 Question and answer
are obvious examples:

1 As Werstine observes in 'McKerrow's "Suggestion", p. 160, what may be a contemporary promptbook of
Anthony Munday's John a Kent and John a Cumber omits commas in SDS in such a way as to amalgamate
characters. Unfamiliarity with the word modernised here as 'weird' may also explain the compositors'
choice of'weyward' and 'weyard', respectively; see the Supplementary Note to 1.3.30, pp. 239-40 above.
2 Textual Companion, p. 637, summarising Werstine. For relineation in this edition, see Appendix 3, p. 275
below.
3 Knight (éd.), Tragedies, 11, 9 note c.
4 Note, too, that F does not always mark the contractions (especially of pronouns before verbs) and other
forms of syncopation and slurring (e.g. ' 'em' for 'them', 'th" for 'the') required to manifest a moderately
regular blank verse.
5 Although Steevens3 established this convention for later editions of verse drama, Ben Jonson had em-
ployed a similar convention in the Jacobean period, and it is fully and elegantly established in Robert
Gomersall's possibly unacted Tragedy of Lodovick Sforza (1628) (see W. W. Greg, A Bibliography of
English Printed Drama, 4 vols., 1939-59, iv, clx); Gorboduc (1565) occasionally indents the second part-line
(see Howard-Hill, 'Evolution', p. 142 n. 82) and, as Werstine (pp. 117-18) shows, so does the manuscript
of the medieval Towneley plays.

Macbeth 
[252]

MACBETH How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
What is't you do?
ALL THE WITCHES 
A deed without a name.

Here F prints 'A deed . . .' immediately following the speech heading. Moments later,
the typographic convention helps actors and readers perceive a choric response to
Macbeth's question:

though the treasure
Of nature's germen tumble altogether
Even till destruction sicken: answer me
To what I ask you.
FIRST WITCH 
Speak.
SECOND WITCH 
Demand.
THIRD WITCH 
We'll answer.

The Folio prints each of the witches' speeches as a separate line, flush left after the
speech heading, whereas modern conventions dictate that 'To what. . . We'll answer'
be regarded as a single line. Current convention also underscores visually such ironic
moments as the instant of Banquo's murder:

BANQUO It will be rain tonight.

FIRST MURDERER 
Let it come down.

and reinforces dramatic tension metrically in such moments as

MACDUFF I am not treacherous.
MALCOLM 
But Macbeth is.
or

ATTENDANT The king comes here tonight.
LADY MACBETH 
Thou'rt mad to say it.

In these cases, again, the Folio aligns successive speeches immediately after the
respective speech headings. These examples and scores more demonstrate that Shake-
speare, like his contemporaries, used metrically shared lines for dramatic effect.1

So metrically complex a play as Macbeth provides instances where adopting or
relining the Folio approaches arbitrary choice. As illustrations, here are two examples
— in one, this edition follows the Folio; in the other, its lines have been rearranged.
G. K. Hunter appropriately draws attention to the moment Macbeth returns to his
wife after murdering Duncan.2 The Folio supplies:

Lady. I heard the Owle schreame, and the Crickets cry.
Did not you speake?
Macb. When?
Lady. Now.
Macb. As I descended?
Lady. I.

1 For an ample discussion of Shakespeare's use of short and shared lines, see George T. Wright, Shake-
speare's Metrical Art, 1988, pp. 116-42.
2 Hunter, p. 196.

[253] 
Textual analysis

Like many modern editors, Hunter prints:

LADY
I heard the owl scream and the cricket's cry.
Did not you speak?

MACBETH 
When?
LADY 
Now.

MACBETH 
As I descended?

LADY 
Ay.

This layout does not represent graphically a plausible enactment: while the sharing
of a pentameter (but which words should make up the line?)1 might indicate the
Macbeths' joint fear and collective guiltiness, few audiences will be able to hear, and
fewer actors will be eager to convey, the line's metrical integrity. Such integrity, of
course, is not the only sort dramatic speech may have: Mozart's or (sometimes) Verdi's
quartets and quintets, for example, blend multiple voices into an enveloping unity-of-
difference, but musical or sonic unity (also available in the theatre) is not necessarily
metrical, as Shaw's effort to orchestrate the voices speaking his prose demonstrates:
'Opera taught me to shape my plays into recitatives, arias, duets, trios, ensemble
finales, and bravura pieces.'2 Imposing a hypermetrical but nominally single line on the
reader's eyes violates my sense of the theatrical moment in Macbeth Act 2, Scene 2.3

For whatever reasons of typographical convenience or printer's convention, the
Folio's layout stipulates less, leaves the text more open to both reader and actors, than
the conventional modern one, and I have therefore followed the Folio:

LADY MACBETH I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?
MACBETH When?
LADY MACBETH Now.
MACBETH As I descended?
LADY MACBETH Ay.

By contrast, a reader or speaker of a passage in Act 4, Scene 3, of the Folio benefits
from having the underlying metrical shape revealed typographically:

. . . and good mens Hues
Expire before the Flowers in their Caps,
Dying, or ere they sicken.
Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true.
Male. What's the newest griefe?
Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,

1 As many editors note in discussing these matters, vocatives (usually proper names) and interjections (here,
'Ay') seem to have been excluded from the metrics of shared pentameters. Marlowe's far more regular
practice almost always excludes vocatives from the line's metre; see C. F. Tucker Brooke, 'Marlowe's
versification and style', SP 19 (1922), 186-205.
2 Quoted in Michael Holroyd, Bernard Shaw, 5 vols., m (1991), 357.1 owe the operatic objection to Brian
Gibbons; the Shavian rebuttal is my own.
3 The editorial or typographical choice (single pentameter or metrically unrelated and disjointed reactions)
is truly a theatrical choice: Lisa Harrow, a distinguished Shakespearean actor, has forcefully claimed to me
that the exchange echoes the 'heartbeat' of Lord and Lady Macbeth and should, therefore, be treated as
a shared pentameter. The editorial choice here probably indicates a hesitant, stunned Macbeth rather than
an eagerly conspiratorial one.

Macbeth 
V2S4\

Each minute teemes a new one.
Macd. How do's my Wife?
Rosse. Why well.
Macd. And all my Children?
Rosse. Well too.
Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace? 
(TLN 2007-18)

In this edition, the passage appears as:

and good men's lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
Dying or ere they sicken.
MACDUFF 
O relation
Too nice, and yet too true.
MALCOLM 
What's the newest grief?
ROSS That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker;
Each minute teems a new one.
MACDUFF 
How does my wife?
ROSS Why, well.
MACDUFF 
And all my children?
ROSS 
Well, too.
MACDUFF The tyrant has not battered at their peace? 
(4.3.173-80)

If'children' is trisyllabic (as it is elsewhere in Shakespeare's verse), this rearrangement
produces regular pentameters that graphically represent the dialogue's association of
ideas and emotions. Whether this second example is clearly or sufficiently different
from the first, only the reader or actor can say.
Macbeth includes sequences of three separate lines which might form two different
combinations of one and one-half pentameter lines. Consider this exchange between
Macbeth and Seyton in the Folio:

Macb. He fight, till from my bones, my flesh be hackt.
Giue me my Armor.
Seyt. 'Tis not needed yet.
Macb. He put it on: 
(TLN 2251-4)

' 'Tis not needed yet' might be joined metrically with either the preceding or following
part-line; it is an 'amphibious' line. Recent editorial practice has been to follow the
Folio's Hneation on these occasions and not to force the amphibious line into metrical
marriage with one or the other of its possible partners, and I have been content to
imitate this irenic practice. And nowhere have I rearranged the Folio's lines on the
assumption that some stage action can be - or was by Shakespeare in planning his
verse lines - substituted for one or more metrical feet.1

One further common occurrence is a part-line at the beginning or, more often,
at the end of a regularly lined speech which is itself framed by regularly lined

1 Compare Fredson Bowers, 'Establishing Shakespeare's text: notes on short lines and the problem of verse
division', SB 33 (1980), 74-130, pp. 91-2, and 'the completion of a line may patently depend on a dramatic
pause, or even an action; but it must be clearly realized that there is no consistency about this: many
pauses, moves, etc., are certainly required which have, as it were, to be extra-metrical - the verse
continues without regard to them' (Brooke, App. A, p. 215).

[255] 
Textual analysis

speeches.1 When Duncan names Malcolm Prince of Cumberland, his speech ends with
a part-line and is immediately followed by a thoroughly plausible pentameter:

But signs of nobleness like stars shall shine
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness
And bind us further to you.
MACBETH The rest is labour which is not used for you . . . 
(1.4.41-4)

Unless compositorial malfeasance can be suspected, these part-lines have been allowed
to stand. At certain places, especially in the work of Compositor A, no rearrangement
seems to restore a regular metre and no obvious principle seems to govern the Folio's
lineation. Thus, to choose an early example:

For brave Macbeth — well he deserves that name -
Disdaining Fortune, with his brandished steel
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like Valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave,
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseamed him from the nave to th'chaps . . . 
(1.2.16-22)

These moments may, of course, indicate cutting, revision, printing catastrophe, or any
combination of these or other events, but whatever intervention has occurred cannot
now be guessed at or rectified. Part-lines must therefore be accepted, perhaps as
theatrically motivated, perhaps as accidental.

Thomas Middleton's contribution to the Folio

Collaborative writing was common in Tudor and Stuart theatre: 'as many as half of the
plays by professional dramatists in this period incorporated the writing at some date of
more than one man'.2 Folio Macbeth is probably no exception and may print passages
not written by Shakespeare but (most probably) by Thomas Middleton; Act 1, Scene
2, has been especially controversial. On two occasions, the Folio may allude to, but
does not print fully, texts that are also probably not by Shakespeare. Ever since Isaac
Reed privately published^ Tragi-coomodie [sic], called The Witch (1778) from a manu-
script with a dedicatory epistle signed 'Tho: Middleton' (though not in his autograph),
scholars have known that Middleton's play contains two songs verbally similar to
fragmentary references in F'S stage directions.3 Neither song is especially well inte-
grated into Folio Macbeth and each fits smoothly into Middleton's tragicomedy; so,
while the date (composition or performance) of Middleton's play is unknown, these
coincidences seem more than chance. They may thus be: the result of Middleton, and/

1 Bowers, 'Establishing Shakespeare's text', pp. 78-9, demonstrates that part-lines more frequently end
than begin speeches.
2 G. E. Bentley, The Profession of Dramatist in Shakespeare's Time 15QO-1642, 1971, pp. 199 and 205-6, and
Carol Chillington Rutter (éd.), Documents of the Rose Playhouse, 1984, pp. 26-8.
3 The manuscript is now MS. Malone 12 in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Epistle and text were probably
transcribed by Ralph Crane c. 1618-27; the 1778 'edition' is by George Steevens (see Edward J. Esche
(éd.), A Critical Edition of Thomas Middleton's 'The Witch', 1993, pp. 12 and 15).

Macbeth

or Shakespeare, and/or a third party sharing a source or sources; borrowings (in any
direction) among the known plays, other printed texts, and hypothetical unknown
texts; the result of deliberate adaptation of one or the other surviving play. The two
instances are not identical and require separate discussion.
After TLN 1466, F reads ''Sing within. Come away, come away, &c.\ and Thomas
Middleton's The Witch has a passage of song and action including ''Come away: Come
away: / Heccat: Heccat, Come away"1 {Witch lines 1331-2). William Davenant's adap-
tation of Macbeth (1674) incorporates a version of this song and the action that seems
to accompany it, particularly Hecate's 'flying' departure, which also seems to be called
for in The Witch:

Hec[ate]. hye thee home with 'em
Looke well to the House to night; I am for aloft.
Fire[stone\. Aloft (quoth you ?) I would you would breake yor necke once,
that I might haue all quickly: hark: hark Mother,

oh what a daintie pleasure 'tis
to ride in the Aire
when the Moone shines faire
and sing, and daunce, and toy, and kiss . . . 
{Witch lines 1324-37, 1358-62)

If Folio Macbeth refers to this song and to some or all of its accompanying action, it
may therefore represent a performance in which Hecate leaves the stage through the
use of a 'machine', a theatrical effect evidently possible in the Blackfriars theatre (the
King's Men's city location after the winter of 1609), but not so certainly available at
the Globe (which they continued to use - as a summer venue - after acquiring the
Blackfriars).2 Simon Forman, who says he saw Macbeth at the Globe in 1611, does not

1 Appendix 2, p. 269 below, reprints Qi673's version of part of this text and action, which also appears in
Davenant's adaptation.
2 Simple ascents and descents were apparently used in medieval French and English religious drama (see
e.g. Alan Nelson's remarks in Jerome Taylor and Alan H. Nelson (eds.), Medieval English Drama, 1972,
pp. 134-5, and David William Young, 'Devices and Feintes of Medieval Religious Theatre in England
and France', unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University, i960) and were widely used in Italian
religious and secular drama in the sixteenth century (see e.g. Edward Carrick, 'Theatre machines in Italy,
1400-1800', Architectural Review 70 (1931), 9-36). Henslowe, p. 7, offers unquestionable evidence for a
flying 'throne' at the Rose in 1595, but John H. Astington strongly argues that public theatres had, or

[257] 
Textual analysis

record any such spectacular moment, although F may also call for the witches to make
a flying exit in Act 1, Scenes 1 and 3.1 One explanation for the added song (and action?)
in Act 3, Scene 5, is that the machinery that 'flew' Hecate off-stage (a human-powered
winch seems likely) was both slow and noisy, and realistic illusion (if it were desired)
therefore required extensive covering sound and action; that is, Middleton and/or the
adapter(s) of Macbeth exploited necessity to add theatrical spectacle. This theoretical
possibility does not explain, however, why no text 'covers' the two earlier moments
when the witches have been thought to depart 'flying', incidents that similarly require
- on the posited assumptions - dialogue and action to conceal noisy and/or slow
machinery.
In sum, if a Jacobean Hecate departed Act 3, Scene 5, via some primitive flying
machine, the time and noise of that operation may have demanded dialogue (and /or
song and action), and Middleton's Witch, or some adapted form thereof, may have
provided the requisite words and action. As G. K. Hunter sagaciously remarks,
however, 'Shakespeare's Macbeth, indeed, needs no more than the first two lines of the
song [in Middleton's play], to be followed by Hecate's flying exit.'2 And one is justified
in asking why the witches' putative flying exits in the first act lack analogous textual
cover. Rather than insert text into Macbeth Act 3, Scene 5, especially since Act 1,
Scenes 1 and 3, arguably require similar but unavailable text, I reprint lines from
Middleton's The Witch in Appendix 2 and suggest readers and producers make their
own choices.
After TLN 1571, F reads 'Musicke and a Song. Blacke Spirits, &c.' and Thomas
Middleton's The Witch contains two seemingly relevant passages:

Titty, and Tiffin, Suckin
and Pidgen, Liard, and Robin
white Spirits, black Spiritts: gray Spiritts: redd Speritts:
Deuill-Toad: Deuill-Ram: Deuill-Catt: and Deuill Dam 
(lines 183-6)

and A Charme Song: about a Vessell that begins, ''Black Spiritts, and white: Red Spiritts,
and Gray, / Mingle, Mingle, Mingle, you that mingle may.1 (lines 1999—2000).3

could have had, at least simple 'flying' machinery as much as two decades before; see Astington, 'Descent
machinery in the playhouses', Medieval & Renaissance Drama in England 2 (1985), 110-33. Shakespeare's
later plays, in particular Cymbeline and perhaps The Tempest, seem to call for 'flying' entrances or exits, but
the textual evidence suggests that different stagings may have been employed at the Globe and the
Blackfriars - that is, the texts are composite or hybrid and represent plural (and mutually incompatible)
stagings. Reviewing the textual evidence concerning apparatus for flying actors at the Globe, T. J. King
concludes: 'such machinery was not required in the vast majority of plays, which suggests that it was also
not available in the vast majority of playhouses'; see Shakespearean Staging, 15QQ-1642, 1971, pp. 36-7
and 148 n. 2. The Blackfriars theatre, however, apparently had effective and not noisy apparatus for
flights; see Irwin Smith, Shakespeare's Blackfriars Playhouse, 1964, pp. 414—18.
1 For Forman, see pp. 57-8 above; for the witches' exits, see 1.1.13 SD n. and Wickham, 'Fly'. On the
possibility that F conflates alternative stagings, see above, p. 247 and n. 2.
2 See Hunter, 3.5.36n., although Hunter's proposal may envisage more modern theatrical equipment than
that available to the King's Men. See also Peter Thomson, Shakespeare's Theatre, 1983, where he describes
3.5 as 'a "reminder scene" - "meanwhile the Witches . . .'" (p. 152), and later remarks, 'there are excuses
for cutting it in performance. All that happens, after all, is that an overbearing, and presumably gor-
geously costumed, Hecate scolds her inferiors and promises to stir up trouble for Macbeth, before heading
off (and up) to a foggy cloud' (pp. 152-3).

Macbeth 
[258]

Middleton knew Reginald Scot's influential work, The Discoverie of Witchcraft
(1584), which contains an appended 'Discourse upon divels and spirits'. Scot's 'Dis-
course' paraphrases A true and just Recorde of the Information, Examination and Con-
fessions of all the Witches . . . at S. Oses . . . Essex (1582) by one 'W. W.' recounting an
investigation by Brian Darcy, JP.1 Echoing the pamphlet, or perhaps a ballad made
from it, Scot writes of

he spirits and shee spirits, Tittie and Tiffin, Suckin and Pidgin, Liard and Robin, &c: his white
spirits and blacke spirits, graie spirits and red spirits, divell tode and divell lambe, divels cat and
divels dam . . . 
(Scot, p. 542)*

Scot's account, and W. W.'s, beg to be commercialised, and Middleton's play virtually
quotes Scot.
In early modern England, no less than in many societies today, sensational events -
accusations of witchcraft, gruesome murders, and the like - were fodder for every
available medium (at that time, drama, pamphlet, and ballad), or, as one later contem-
porary wrote, such events were 'Staged, Book'd, and Balleted'; one witch pamphlet
was published specifically to discredit 'the most base and false Ballets, which were
sung at the time of our returning from the Witches execution'.3 The similarities among
the texts by W. W., Scot, Middleton and the Folio are striking, but they do not
indicate any clear sequence of borrowing and indebtedness. Middleton certainly, and
Shakespeare very probably, knew Scot's Discoverie; each may have known W. W.'s
pamphlet; each may have known lost ballads, pamphlets, plays, letters, gossip, or other
written or oral sources concerning contemporary witchcraft practices.4 Moreover, the
most distinctive verbal features linking the surviving documents (the coloured spirits,
devilish animals, spirit names) hardly appear in the Folio, particularly since associat-
ing witches' spirits with various colours was a commonplace recalled, for example, by
Mistress Quickly's invocation as Queen of Fairies, 'Fairies, black, grey, green,, and
white, / You moonshine revellers, and shades of night' (Wiv. 5.5.37—8).5 Furthermore,

1 Many have speculated that Darcy himself was in some way responsible for the pamphlet; it is reprinted
in Rosen, pp. 104-57.
2 I cite the original (1584) edition's page numbers, as given in Nicholson's 1886 reprint. The similarity
among W. W.'s pamphlet, Scot, and Middleton was noted by Malone (iv, 386) and discussed by
Nicholson, pp. 544-5. See Witch, pp. xi-xii, where W. W. Greg oddly claims that Middleton is unlikely
to have known W. W.'s pamphlet because only two copies survive: for popular, ephemeral texts of this
sort, the fewer the survivals the more likely it is that copies were read to destruction.
3 See Thomas Taylor, The Second Part of the Theatre of Gods Judgments (title page dated 1642, but
bibliographically integrated into the 1648 edition of Thomas Beard's earlier Theatre of Gods Judgments),
sig. 3K2v, p. 94, and Henry Goodcole, The wonderful! discoverie of Elizabeth Sawyer (1621), sig.
A3V, respectively. Goodcole later remarks that certain sensational events were 'shamelessly printed and
openly sung in a ballad' (sig. Dir, margin), though no ballad of this episode survives. Compare the
speed with which similar modern events reach print, film, television, popular songs, and other public
representations.
4 Hyder E. Rollins, An Analytical Index to the Ballad-entries (1557-170Q) in the Stationers' Register, SP 21
(1924), 1—324, lists two witchcraft episodes which generated both books and ballads: the Chelmsford
witches (1589) and the witches of Warboys (1593); see Rollins, pp. 131 and 124, and Rosen, pp. 182-9 and
239-97. F° r Shakespeare's likely knowledge of Scot, see Bullough, 1, 371-3 (on A Midsummer's Night's
Dream).
5 The witchcraft pamphlets reprinted by Rosen generally identify familiars by species and colour, e.g. two
toads called Great and Little Browning, p. 70 (Dorset, 1566); two cows called Crow (black and white) and

[25g] 
Textual analysis

in what seems indisputably to be Shakespearean text, the witches complete their brew
- 'Cool it with a baboon's blood, / Then the charm is firm and good' (4.1.37-8) - but
the action that follows Middleton's song in The Witch, action that Oxford and Brooke
incorporate into Macbeth, includes further additions to the cauldron, accompanied by
obscene analogies between sexual intercourse and putting in those ingredients. Adding
Middleton's witches to Shakespeare's text confuses the audience and confounds
the recipe.1 These (Middletonian?) witches 'are less successful than Shakespeare's
own arresting presentation because they speak not to Macbeth's fears but to the
audience's . . . '2

Thus, while the Folio's laconic 'Blacke Spirits, £5V.' may point to the 'Charme Song1

of Middleton's The Witch, it may equally point to another passage in the same play
{Witch lines 185-6) or to an entirely different and so far unknown song made from
similar or identical materials. These possibilities, it seems to me, confound an editor
who seeks a 'snapshot' of a pre-Folio Shakespeare-Middleton Macbeth. Rather than
adding suspect text to Folio Macbeth, as editors have done or been tempted to do ever
since The Witch was rediscovered, I have preferred to reprint Middleton's text in
Appendix 2, p. 270 below, where readers and producers may make what use of it they
choose.

Revision in the Folio

Given the almost inarguable presence of one other author's writing in Folio Macbeth,
it is not surprising that passages and even entire scenes have been regarded as non-
Shakespearean. What E. K. Chambers famously called the 'disintegration of Shake-
speare' was a peculiarly nineteenth-century phenomenon, and a less intuitive variant
has reappeared in recent claims for revision or adaptation (by Shakespeare or others)
during the early theatrical life of plays subsequently printed in F. Many arguments for
non-Shakespearean writing (e.g. of the Porter's speeches beginning Act 2, Scene 3)
have been rejected as the product of a critic's (or an age's) assumptions or prejudice.3

Here, I propose one example of possible revision (presumably by Shakespeare, but not
necessarily so) and consider two other examples that have the most sustainable claims.
A section of Act 2, Scene 3 (TLN 885-94), begins and ends with identical lines:
Macduff says, 'Look to the lady', and so does Banquo; the intervening five lines are
Malcolm's and Donaldbain's sotto voce worries about who murdered their father and
about their own futures.4 Identical lines in close proximity often mark 'repetition

Donne (red and white), p. 152 (Essex, 1582); two black frogs, Jack and Jill, p. 184 (Chelmsford, 1589); a
thing called Blue, p. 283 (Huntingdon, 1593); Ball, a brown dog, p. 365 (Lancashire, 1613). W. W.'s
pamphlet shows how colour and spirit may be combined casually: 'Tyffen is like a white lambe' (sig. A3v)
and ''Tyffyn her white spirit' (sig. c8).
1 Inga-Stina Ewbank, 'The middle of Middleton' (in Biggs, pp. 158-60), succinctly shows the difference
between Shakespeare's and Middleton's witches.
2 Mackinnon, p. 69.
3 In Appendixes E-G of his Warwick Shakespeare edition, E. K. Chambers judiciously reviews the
nineteenth-century debate over various passages and scenes.
4 In the following discussion, I have supposed that the dramatist would avoid repeating the same line in
close succession. Another, more theatrical (?), argument would hold that the repeated lines appropriately

Macbeth 
[260]

brackets', signs of a copyist's or compositor's inaccurate treatment of added or deleted
text. The mechanical details of how such repeated lines might have been included in
a printed text are amply documented,1 and they suggest that someone interrupted
the scene's original development to add text (irregularly lined in F) 'covering' Lady
Macbeth's business and motivating Malcolm's and Donaldbain's flight.2 At some
point before F'S copy arrived at the form the compositors saw, the text might have read
(modernised) something like this:

LADY MACBETH Help me hence, ho!
MACDUFF 
Look to the lady.
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet. . .

Repetition brackets usually occur within the speech of a single character, and F'S
attribution of the first 'Look to the lady' to Macduff and the second to Bânquo is
slightly puzzling. If someone thought about Banquo's earlier status as one who had 'no
less deserved' (1.4.18)3 than Macbeth, however, that person might have decided to
make Banquo the leading respondent to Duncan's murder. At some point, perhaps
when Malcolm's and Donaldbain's speeches were written and their insertion marked
(with the link, 'Look to the lady', or some similar phrase), the marking of (new) speech
headings went slightly wrong.4

I propose that if (and when) the speeches by Malcolm and Donaldbain were
inserted, 2.3.118-25 was transferred from Macduff, who came from outside the castle,
to Banquo, the royal confidant important enough to spend the night inside the castle
and the character who now takes charge of the crisis. This hypothetical change
supports Banquo's status as near co-equal with Macbeth in the first part of the play
and reserves Macduff for the prominence his flight, his family's murder, and his

draw attention to Lady Macbeth's behaviour, a claim similar to the one defending an earlier repetition at
TLN 829 and 835/2.3.68, 74 (see Supplementary Note on 2.3.74, P- 2 4 J above). In contrast, my argument
assumes a common Shakespearean technique: several things are happening on stage at once, or nearly so
(precisely when, for example, does Lady Macbeth exit?), and the printed text inescapably records those
simultaneous stage-events as a temporal reading-sequence. Print cannot easily represent simultaneous
events on stage: Lady Macbeth does whatever she does when she says 'Help me hence, ho'; some character
says, 'Look to the lady'; Malcolm and Donaldbain speak; some character says, 'Look to the lady.'
1 Robert Kean Turner, 'Revisions and repetition brackets in Fletcher's A Wife for a Month1, SB 36 (1983),
178-90, summarises and develops the work of Wilson (who coined the term 'repetition bracket') and Greg
(who showed how 'the brackets may theoretically indicate either addition or omission'). See John Dover
Wilson, 'The copy for "Hamlet", 1603', The Library, 3rd ser., 9 (1918), 153-85, pp. 173-4, and Greg, pp.
165-6.
2 See e.g. Halio 2.1.138 n., and Brooke speculates: 'It is possible that these lines were an afterthought, since
they first articulate the suspicions that are previously only implicit in the dialogue, and F has similar
problems with Malcolm and Donalbain' in the scene's final dialogue (Brooke, App. A, p. 220).
3 See also 2.1.15-16 n.
4 Added speeches of the length of Malcolm's and Donaldbain's might be written in the manuscript's margin
or more probably on slips pasted to the manuscript (thus producing the lineation oddities of F?). The
manuscript (British Library Lansdowne MS. 807) of the so-called Second Maiden's Tragedy elaborately
illustrates such amendments and additions and is notable for the way the 'link lines' (the cross-references
telling a reader, copyist, or compositor where to add material) do not exactly duplicate the main text. See
Anne Lancashire (éd.), The Second Maiden's Tragedy, 1978, and Eric Rasmussen, 'Shakespeare's hand in
The Second Maiden's Tragedy', SQ^\o (1989), 1-26.

[261] 
Textual analysis

alliance with the English give him in the second part of the play. When the amended
text was recopied and/or when it was set in type, none of the changes of speakers and
all of the additions of speeches were made, producing the Folio text.
At the end of Act 3, Scene 4 (TLN i4ioff.), Macbeth worries about Macduff s
absence from the banquet and asserts he 'will send' to learn the reason. In Act 3, Scene
6, an anonymous Lord tells Lennox that Macduff 'Is gone' to 'the English court'
(3.6.30, 26) seeking military assistance, Lennox and the Lord acknowledge that
Macbeth 'sent... to Macduff, the Lord relates how Macduff insulted Macbeth's
messenger (41-4), and Lennox hopes that an angel will speed MacdufPs message to
Edward (46-8).'
All these matters are treated as past and known, but in Act 4, Scene 1, the 'galloping
of horse' (4.1.139) Macbeth hears is the horses of messengers come to tell him that
Macduff'is fled to England' (141), news he greets perhaps with incredulity, perhaps
with anger, certainly with surprise: 'Fled to England?' Macbeth determines upon
more sudden and violent responses henceforth: 'From this moment, / The very
firstlings of my heart shall be / The firstlings of my hand' (145-7). Act 3, Scene 6, also
includes smaller puzzles: one popular emendation not accepted here makes F'S ap-
parent reference to the English King Edward, 'their king' (3.6.38), into a reference to
King Macbeth (Hanmer and most other editors: 'the king'),2 but nothing can be done
to mitigate the abruptness with which Lennox introduces Macbeth and the anecdote
of the 'cloudy messenger' whom Macduff rejects: 'Sent he to Macduff?' (40), where
'he' must be King Macbeth, not King Edward.
In the unlikely event of an audience paying minute attention to problems of this
sort, the matter might just be resolved by a timetable:

(1) 
Macbeth 'sends' to Macduff to demand a reason for his absence in Act 3, Scene

4-
(2) 
The messenger is rebuffed.
(3) 
Macduff starts for England; some Scottish courtiers, but not Macbeth, know that
fact.
(4) Reassured by the prophecies of Act 4, Scene 1, Macbeth first decides he has
nothing to fear from Macduff (4.1.81) and then determines to kill him (83).
(5) Lennox (who knew of Macduffs flight in Act 3, Scene 6) reports that messengers
have arrived to say that Macduff'is fled to England' (4.1.141).
(6) Macbeth decides to attack Macduffs castle, family, and retainers (4.1.149-52).

A partial solution to these narrative inconsistencies would be to reverse the order of
Act 3, Scene 6, and Act 4, Scene 1, but whatever further revision has taken place makes

1 The main modern treatments of the apparent confusions at the end of Act 3 and the beginning of Act 4
are Muir, p. xxxiv (compare Muir's revised 9th Arden edition, 1962, pp. xxxiv-xxxv) and Brooke, pp. 5 1 -
3. The earliest comment I have found on the narrative and temporal problem here appears in 'Christopher
North' [i.e. John Wilson], 'Dies Boréales. No. V, Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine 66 (November 1849),
649-53. See also, and more generally, Brian Richardson, ' "Hours dreadful and things strange": inversions
of chronology and causality in Macbeth', PQ68 (1989), 283-94.
2 The confusion of abbreviated 'the' and 'their' would have been easy in contemporary (Secretary) hand,
since each might consist of y followed by a single suspended symbol.

Macbeth 
[262]

that switch unsatisfactory, since Lennox's speeches (3.6.40-50 and 4.1.140-1) in the
two scenes would remain realistically inconsistent.1 A reversal of F'S order redis-
tributes, but does not solve, the inconsistencies, and has the further liability of juxta-
posing the play's final witch-scenes (3.5 and 4.1 in F).2

The original sequence, if it was different, may have attributed one or the other of
Lennox's speeches to a different character, as Muir suggests (p. xxxiv). The speeches
assigned to 'Lennox' throughout Macbeth are puzzling: in Act 3, Scene 4, the character
appears a courteous, if confused, guest at his new king's banquet; in Act 3, Scene 6, he
seems an opponent of Macbeth, as he does in Act 5, Scene 2; in Act 2, Scene 3, and
Act 4, Scene 1, he seems to support, or at least to accept, King Macbeth. There are
various possible explanations: consistent characterisation was not important to the
dramatist(s); Lennox's speeches may have been incorrectly identified; a revision may
not have been carried through completely; 'Lennox' may have been chosen as chorus
in Act 3, Scene 6; 'Lennox' is a vague type-designation meant to be clarified and
rationalised in performance.3

Even granting that the time references of Act 3's final three scenes and of Act 4,
Scene 1, may be neither precise nor clear, and granting that the timetable above makes
'Lennox' markedly inconsistent (or the victim of incomplete revision), an audience of
narrative and dramatic accountants is hard to imagine. And in fact such an audience
has not been imagined by producers who, since before Davenant (see p. 61 above),
have regularly cut, trimmed, or adapted the Folio's otherwise excellent Act 3, Scene
6. The reason is obvious: rationalised or not, Act 3, Scene 6, destroys the theatrical
effect of time (and Macduff) overtaking Macbeth's schemes and of Macbeth's
appallingly violent reaction in Act 4, Scenes 1 and 2.
Act 4, Scene 3, lines 139-61 (TLN 1968—91), Malcolm's dialogue with the doctor and
his explanation of the King's Evil, have been regarded as an interpolation by Shake-
speare or another author into a pre-existing text,4 and it is true that MacdufPs ' 'Tis
hard to reconcile' (4.3.139) makes a pentameter line with his 'See who comes here'
(161). Linked or 'linkable' part-lines of this sort have been claimed as signs of revi-
sion,5 and it is certainly arguable that F does not resolve MacdufPs justified puzzle-
ment at Malcolm's earlier words and behaviour. A further objection to this passage,
and one not hitherto considered, is the description of the entering character as a Doctor

1 According to Muir (p. xxxiv), the reversal was first suggested by G. Crosse, 'Spurious passages in
Macbeth', N&Qgo (1898), 321-2, but Ludvig Josephson's 1880 Stockholm production apparently used
(with cuts?) the Folio's scenes in the sequence 4.1, 3.5, 3.6; see Ann Fridén, 'Macbeth' in the Swedish
Theatre 1838-1986, 1986, p. 53.
2 The banquet scene (3.4) and the cauldron scene (4.1) would, however, not adjoin as Muir (p. xxxiv)
claims.
3 Further, at some point in Macbeth's composition or revision the sequence of events may have been
contaminated by memories of Holinshed's account, where Macduffs flight occurs after his family's
slaughter {Scotland, pp. 1740-1753).
4 See Clarendon, pp. x-xi; NS, pp. xxxii-xxxiii; and the vigorous objections of Nevill Coghill, 'Macbeth at
the Globe, 1606-1616 (?): three questions', in Joseph G. Price (éd.), The Triple Bond, 1975, p. 231. The
passage is frequently cut in performance.
5 See e.g. W. A. Wright (éd.), King John, 1866, 3.4.68 n., where lines 21-67 are considered an interpolation
because the preceding and following half-lines make a pentameter. Note also that what may be 'repetition
brackets' appear in this passage: 'Bind up those tresses' and 'Bind up your hairs.'

Textual analysis

(4.3.139 SD), evidently of medicine, whereas his Scottish counterpart in Act 5, Scene
1, is more specifically identified as a Doctor of Physicke (TLN 2093). The distinction
may be fortuitous,1 but the slacker terminology of Act 4, Scene 3, might point to a
revising author's haste or inattention. There are, however, strong dramatic arguments
for the passage's value as a development of the contrast between good and bad
kingship represented in Malcolm's and MacdufPs earlier conversation: Edward the
saintly physician—doctor of his kingdom versus Macbeth the demonic murderer
of his, a monarch haplessly asking his doctor-figure to 'cast / The water of my land'
(5.3.51-2).2

1 See 5.1.0 SD n. on the distinction between a medical and a clerical 'doctor'. The distinction affects
costuming and is significant in the demonic context of Act 5, Scene 1.
2 Muir appropriately cites L. C. Knights, Explorations, 1946, p. 31, and G. W. Knight, Wheel of Fire, 1949,
p. 148, in defence of the passage.

APPENDIX i: CASTING MACBETH

Modern accounts of acting styles and production practices in Shakespeare's theatre
are largely guesswork. Contemporary evidence states that Richard Burbage first
played Shakespeare's Richard III, Hamlet, Othello, and Lear for the Lord Chamber-
lain's and later the King's Men as well as many other important rôles (see Edwin
Nungezer, A Dictionary of Actors, 1929). It seems likely that Burbage also originated
Macbeth. Jacobeans extolled Burbage for his naturalism and pathos in tragic rôles, but
all such accounts employ unknowable standards and relative conventions. As acting
styles and conventions in the silent and talking cinema show, one period's perform-
ance of genius becomes for another audience (in ten, or twenty, or fifty years) an over-
blown or underplayed failure.
We may guess that the King's Men's principal comic played the Porter (today often
a nearly unperformable part), and that actor was probably Robert Armin, whose
known rôles and writings suggest he was an actor who did 'not talk with but [was]
heard by his audience . . . [an actor who] talks to his own alter ego rather than to the
audience' (David Wiles, Shakespeare's Clown: Actor and Text in the Elizabethan Play-
house, 1987, pp. 151, 161), just as the Porter invents conversation-partners and stipu-
lates the audience's reaction in Act 2, Scene 3, and just as the actor playing Falstaff
might in his honour-catechism (1H4 5.1.129 ff.). For similar casting reasons, 'the
Murderers were [in the eighteenth century] the proscriptive property of the low
comedians' (William Archer and Robert W. Lowe, ' "Macbeth" on the stage', English
Illustrated Magazine (December 1888), 239).
Bartholomeusz (pp. 10-12) guesses that John Rice, a young actor of genius accord-
ing to contemporary reports, played Lady Macbeth, but the early casts and how they
filled their rôles cannot be convincingly recovered. Like several other Shakespearean
heroines (Cleopatra and Volumnia in particular), Lady Macbeth proves a controversial
case, and scholars have claimed that an adult male, not a pre-pubescent boy, played
such rôles; for contrasting views, see G. E. Bentley, The Profession of Player in
Shakespeare's Time, 15QO-1642, 1984, pp. 113-14, and Carol Chillington Rutter (éd.),
Documents of the Rose Playhouse, 1984, pp. 224-5.
While the list of speaking and silent characters is long, Macbeth was probably
performed in Shakespeare's theatre with a relatively small number of actors, several of
whom 'doubled' or even 'tripled' parts - that is, one actor played two or three speaking
or silent rôles. Believing that the King's Men usually cast sixteen adult men and a
variable number of boy-actors, David Bradley finds that the company had run out of
available adult men in early productions of Act 5, Scene 3: 'the servant with the goose-
look in Macbeth [5.3.12] must certainly be a boy, as Macbeth calls him, for although
the term is sometimes used to mean "coward", all sixteen men in the cast, apart from
the two attendants who enter with Macbeth, are fully occupied elsewhere, preparing

[265] 
Appendix 1 : Casting Macbeth

to enter as Malcolm's soldiers' (From Text to Performance in the Elizabethan Theatre,
1992, p. 39). A fine ensemble production oï Macbeth, Trevor Nunn's Royal Shake-
speare Company version with Judi Dench and Ian McKellen in 1976-8, employed
only some fourteen actors (see p. 82 above), doubling Ian McDiarmid as Ross and the
Porter and Tim Brierley as Donaldbain and Seyton (who also appeared in numerous
Folio 'Messenger' rôles, as the actor of 'Seyton' had since Davenant's and Garrick's
texts), for instance. 'Political' interpretations often double Ross: Roman Polanski's
film (1971) made Ross both the Third Murderer of Act 3, Scene 3, and at least an
accomplice of the murderers of Lady Macduff in Act 4, Scene 2. Lennox is also
susceptible to such thematic, 'Machiavellian' doublings. Productions using a larger
company will none the less often double a few rôles: Peter Hall's 1967 RSC production
doubled Jeffery Dench as the Old Man of Act 2, Scene 4, and the Scottish Doctor of
Act 5, Scene 1, and Daniel Moynihan as the Captain (or 'Sergeant') of Act 1, Scene 2,
and the Lord of Act 3, Scene 6. Twentieth-century productions - for example, Glen
By am Shaw's (Stratford, 1955) - doubled Duncan and the Scottish Doctor very
effectively; the 5 November 1928 London revival of Barry Jackson's modern-dress
production (originally Birmingham Repertory) doubled Duncan with First Murderer,
Banquo with the Scottish Doctor, and the latter doubling was repeated in Andrew
Leigh's Old Vic (London) production the next year. The play's two principal female
rôles, Lady Macbeth and Lady Macduff, are very rarely doubled. Nunn's production
doubled Lady Macduff and one of the witches, and Braham Murray's Royal Exchange
(Manchester) production set in a Nazi death camp more provocatively doubled Lady
Macbeth (Frances Barber) and one of the witches 'in white shifts' (see North West
Times, 4 November 1988, and Jeremy Kingston, The Times, 5 November 1988); Andy
Hines's Bristol Theatre Royal production included what are probably Thomas
Middleton's lines for Hecate and doubled the part with that of Lady Macduff (see
B. A. Young, Financial Times, 10 November 1987). Lavish casts have one main
advantage in Act 5: the series of short scenes documenting the Anglo-Scottish attack
on Macbeth may demonstrate - through an ever-fuller stage - the volume of right's
recoil upon wrong.
How old are Lord and Lady Macbeth? The Folio text gives little explicit help with
this important decision for the producer. In his film, Polanski cast young actors as the
couple and thereby emphasised both their naïveté and their sensuality, but middle-
aged sensuality also has a powerful appeal (compare Antony and Cleopatra), and one
Hungarian production, at least, made Lady Macbeth distinctly older than her husband
and Macbeth consequently 'pliable' (Leiter, p. 386). Less obviously, the represented
age of a relatively minor character, Lennox (who claims a 'young remembrance'
(2.3.54)), c a n strongly influence the audience's experience.
When a character appears or does not appear on stage subtly affects the audience's
responses: Macduff, for instance, first appears in Act 2, Scene 3, very late for so
important a figure; Lady Macbeth appears often and crucially in the first three acts
(1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4) and then not again and finally until Act 5, Scene
1. Her continued presence and then her long absence measure a changing private as
well as a changing public relation, both that of wife and husband and that of Lord/

Macbeth 
[266]

King Macbeth with Scotland and his heart. This gap poses serious problems for the
actor, and many productions prepare for the sleepwalking scene (Act 5, Scene 1) by
having Lady Macbeth show incipient signs of mental or physical weakness at the end
of the banquet scene (Act 3, Scene 4); in many productions, too, Macbeth explicitly
dismisses her — with the possibly neutral line, 'While then, God be with you' (3.1.45)
- before he meets the Murderers, thus indicating her diminished part in Macbeth's
plans. Macbeth disappears after Act 4, Scene 1, when about two-thirds of the play's
lines have been spoken, and returns in Act 5, Scene 3, when the audience has wit-
nessed a further fifth of the play's dialogue. While Macbeth is absent, the Anglo-
Scottish political and military alliance gathers against him. (This absence is also a
customary Shakespearean 'rest' for the principal tragic actor, who needs to gather
energy for the play's conclusion.)
Anthony Brennan's statistics in Onstage and Offstage Worlds in Shakespeare's Plays
(1989) confirm many common impressions about the relative importance of Macbeth
and Lady Macbeth compared with major rôles in some of Shakespeare's other trag-
edies. Macbeth takes up a great deal of his eponymous play: he speaks more than 30
per cent of the play's lines and is on stage for more than half the dialogue (Brennan,
p. 97). Macbeth's rôle accounts for a higher percentage of his play's lines than the rôles
of any other Shakespearean tragic character except (by tiny margins) the Prince in
Hamlet and Iago in Othello. Only Hamlet, Titus, Romeo and Juliet, Richard II and
Bolingbroke, Othello and Iago slightly outpoint Macbeth in the second category,
presence on stage. These same statistics, however, do not confirm what might be
another common impression. Measured in lines of dialogue, Lady Macbeth has a small
part, only about 10 per cent of the play's spoken lines (hers is the second-largest part
in Macbeth, but smaller than Juliet's in Romeo and Juliet, or Claudius's in Hamlet, and
about the size of Desdemona's in Othello), though she is on stage for more than a
quarter of the play's spoken lines (Brennan, p. 97). She last appears with her husband
(Act 3, Scene 4) after only slightly more than half the play's lines have been spoken
(Brennan, p. 17). Banquo, as a living figure and as a ghost, appears in nearly a third of
the play's scenes, almost the equal of the seemingly ubiquitous Ross, who speaks more
lines.

Treating part-lines as full lines and using this edition's lineation and attribution of
speeches, here are some line-counts (compiled by Michael Cohen) for various rôles:

First Witch: 61 lines
Duncan: 69 lines
Malcolm: 206 lines
Lennox: 64 lines
Ross: 134 lines
Macbeth: 700 lines
Banquo: 112 lines
Lady Macbeth: 254 lines
Porter: 29 lines
Macduff: 174 lines

[26/] 
Appendix 1 : Casting Macbeth

Lady Macduff: 42 lines
Si ward: 30 lines

A modern, hypothetical Jacobean casting of Macbeth in T. J. King, Casting Shake-
speare's Plays, 1992, finds that 'Nine men can play twelve principal male rôles, and
eight boys play seven principal female rôles and Macduff s Son' (p. 91), and Bradley,
From Text to Performance, p. 237, finds a cast of sixteen adults and four to eight boys
'probable'.

APPENDIX 2: ADDITIONAL TEXT AND MUSIC

As the Textual Analysis argues (pp. 255-63 above), Macbeth has been revised,
adapted, and otherwise changed from very early in the play's theatrical existence.
Spectacle - especially the weird sisters and their appearance, and the action, songs and
dances associated with them — has been the primary focus of change (see ''Macbeth in
performance', pp. 57-84 above). Whatever changes we may guess the Folio records,
the first documented evidence of adaptation or revision appears in Q1673, where the
text mainly, though not exclusively, follows the Folio but has certain substantial
additions, all connected with the sisters.
At the end of Macbeth Act 2, Scene 2, after 'Wake Duncan with thy knocking: / I
would thou could'st. Exeunt? (TLN 739—40), which Q1673 treats as a single line, the
quarto prints (sig. D2):

Enter Witches, and Sing.
1. Speak, Sister, is the Deed done}
2. Long ago, long ago.
Above twelve Glasses since are run.
1. /// Deeds are seldome slow.
Nor single following Crimes on former wait
The worst of Creatures fastest propagate.
Many more murders must this one ensue,
As if in Death were propagation too.
He will, he shall, he must spill much more blood,
And become worse to make his Title good.
Now let's Dance. Agreed, agreed, agreed.
Chorus. We should rejoyce when good Kings bleed.
When Cattle dye, about we go,
What then, when Monarchs perish, should we do}
We should, £5V.

At the end of Macbeth Act 2, Scene 3, after ''Exeunt? (TLN 922), the quarto prints (sig.
D4v):

Enter Witches, Dance and Sing.
Let's have a Dance upon the Heath,
We gain more Life by Duncan's Death.
Sometimes like brinded Cats we shew,
Having no musick but our mew.
Sometimes we Dance in some Old Mill,
Upon the Hopper, Stones, and Wheel,
To some Old Saw, or bardish Rhime,
Where still the Mill-Clack does keep time.
Sometime about a hollow Tree
A Round, a Round, a Round Dance we:

\2Ôg\ 
Appendix 2: Additional text and music

Thither the chirping Critick comes,
And Beetles singing drowsie hums.
Sometimes we Dance 0 're Fens and Furrs,
To howls of Wolves, and barks ofCurrs.
And when with none of these we meet,
We Dance to the Ecchoes of our Feet. 
[Exeunt.]

At the conclusion of Macbeth Act 3, Scene 5, after 'Sits in a Foggy cloud, and stayes
for me.' (TLN 1466), Q1673 (sigs- F3V~F4r) replaces ''Sing within. Come away, come
away, &V.' (TLN 1467) with song and action apparently derived from Thomas
Middleton's The Witch (see Textual Analysis, pp. 256-7 above):

Sing within. 1 Come away Heccat, Heccat, Oh, come away;
2 / come, I come, with all the speed I may,
I come, I come, with all the speed I may.
1 Whereas Stadling?
3 Here.
1 Where's Puckle?
4 Here; and Hopper too, and Helway too;
1 We want but you, we want but you.
Come away, make up the 'count
I will but noint, and then I mount
I will, &c.
1 Here comes one, it is
To fetch his due, a kiss,
I [Ay] A Cull, sip of blood;
And why thou stayst so long, I muse,
Since the Aire 's so sweet and good;
0 art thou cornel What News}
[sig. F4r] 
2 All goes fair for our delight,
Either come, or else refuse,
Now I am furnish'd for the flight,
Now I go, now Iflie.
Malkin my sweet spirit and I.
3 Oh what a dainty Pleasure's this,
To sail i 'th ' Air,
While the Moon shines fair,
To sing, to toy and kiss,
Over Woods, high Rocks and Mountains,
Over misty Hills and Fountains,
Over Steeples, Towres and Turrets,
We flie by night 'mongst Troops of spirits.
Cho. No Ring of Bells to our ears sounds,
No Howls of Wolves, nor Yelps of Hounds,
No, nor the Noise of Waters breach,
Nor Cannons Throats our height can reach.

Q1673 then ends the action, as the Folio does (TLN 1468-9), with

1 Come let's make hast, shee'l soone be
Backe againe. 
Exeunt

Macbeth 
[270]

The quarto of 1673, that is, places non-Folio text and action (some of it derived from
Witch) at, respectively, the conclusions of Folio Macbeth Act 2, Scene 2, Act 2, Scene
3, and Act 3, Scene 5.
After the murder of Duncan, Davenant's adaptation, which exists in an incomplete
early manuscript (see Christopher Spencer, Davenant's 'Macbeth' from the Yale
Manuscript, 1961) and a quarto (1674), brings Macduff and Lady Macduff together on
'An Heath' to witness (quarto, pp. 26-7), abruptly, versions of 'Speak, Sister . . .'
(headed ''First Song by Witches') and then 'Let's have a dance' (headed 'Second Song''),
where there is an added quatrain:

At the night-Raven's dismal voice,
Whilst others tremble, we rejoyce;
And nimbly, nimbly dance we still
To th'ecchoes from an hollow Hill.

Davenant's scene ends with dialogue in which Macduff questions the sisters about his
future as Macbeth and Banquo had earlier about theirs. Davenant then reverses
Macbeth Act 3, Scenes 5 and 6, and extends (pp. 44-5) with minor variants the Folio's
Act 3, Scene 5, as Q1673 had done, returning to the Folio text at the end of the scene,
adding:

2. But whilst she moves through the foggy Air,
Let's to the Cave and our dire Charms prepare.

Unlike Q1673, which repeats the Folio's laconic SD at 4.1.43 (TLN 1571: lMusicke and
a Song. Blacke Spirits, &V.'), Davenant's text expands 'Black spirits' with a version of
lines apparently from Middleton's The Witch, where there are two possible 'sources'
(see Textual Analysis, p. 257 above). The shorter is reprinted in the Textual Analysis
(p. 257); the longer, headed 'A Charme Song: about a Vessell.\ follows:

Black Spiritts, and white: Red Spiritts, and Gray,
Mingle, Mingle, Mingle, you that mingle may.
Titty, Tiffin: keepe it stiff in
Fire-Drake, Puckey, Make it Luckey.
Liand, Robin, you must bob in
Round, a-round, a-round, about, about
All ill come running-in, all Good keepe-out.
1. witch heeres the Blood of a Bat.
Hec[ate\. Put in that: oh put in that.
2. heer's Libbards Bane
Hec[ate\. Put-in againe
1. the Iuice of Toad: the Oile of Adder
2. those will make the yonker madder.
Hec[ate]. Put in: ther's all, and rid the Stench.
Fire[stone]. nay heeres three ounces of the red-haired wench.
all Round: around: around &c:/.

(Witch lines 1999-2014; compare Davenant, 1674, p. 47)

Appendix 2: Additional text and music

Along with The Witch and Davenant's slight reworking of its lines, several musical
scores with slightly variant texts of 'Come away, come away' have survived; they are
elaborately collated in Brooke, as are the available versions - The Witch, Davenant's
manuscript, and the quarto of 1674 - of'Black spirits and white'.
Just how and by whom the songs of the revised Macbeth may have been set to music
before the famous Matthew Locke settings for Davenant's version is unclear. The best
concise treatment of the seventeenth-century musical settings appears in Bryan N. S.
Gooch et al., A Shakespeare Music Catalogue, 5 vols., 1991,11, 705-803; as the authors
advise (11, 739), 'the chronology of this tradition can best be followed if [the relevant
Macbeth] entries are read in the following order: 6925, 7013, 6971, 7101, and 6705'.
For musical scores, John H. Long, Shakespeare's Use of Music: The Histories and
Tragedies, 1971, pp. 193-5 an<^ 199, offers the following possibilities:

APPENDIX 3: RELINEATION OF THE FOLIO

With a few exceptions noted below, this appendix records places where F'S lineation
has been changed; using the customary short titles (see the List of Abbreviations, pp.
xi-xxii above), each entry lists the source or sources (if more than one editor's
relineation has been adopted in a single, continuous passage) of the relineation, F'S
line-division (represented by the terminal word of each line and an oblique bar to mark
the line end), and any other plausible relineation. (For clarity, some notes cite more
than a line's last word.) Since neither spelling nor punctuation is at stake here,
quotations from F are modernised, readings from other editions are silently normalised
as they are in the collation, and punctuation is omitted unless required for clarity.
Centred SDS which form a separate line in F are omitted. On a few occasions, the notes
record places where F has been retained, followed by a rejected change. Not recorded
here are uncontroversial impositions of the modern typographical convention that
when two or more speakers share a pentameter line, text should be indented to show
that fact (see Textual Analysis, pp. 251—2 above). Also not recorded are the places
where a metrically regular line was too long to fit into the space available in the Folio's
rather narrow two-column format and where, therefore, the compositors had to 'turn
over' one or more words and (as they quite often did) happened to capitalise the first
word of the turned-over text, making it appear to be a new verse line; the note to
3.1.48-52 records what may be an exception to this practice. The few relineations
involving changes in SHS are recorded in the collation.
