The entire play takes place in Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. 

No curtain. No scenery. 

The audience, arriving, sees an empty stage in half-light. Presently the Stage 

Manager. When the Stage Manager reaches his place, the lights come to black. 

After one count, the lights come to full. 

Stage Manager 

This play is called "Our Town." The day is May 7, 1901. The time is just before 
dawn. 

A rooster crows. 

The sky is beginning to show some streaks of light over in the East there, 
behind our mount'in. 

Well, I'd better show you how our town lies. Up here is Main Street. Way back 
there is the railway station. Polish Town's across the tracks. 

Over there is the Congregational Church; across the street's the Presbyterian. 
Methodist and Unitarian are over there. Baptist is down in the holla' by the 
river. Catholic Church is over beyond the tracks. 

Here's the Town Hall and Post Office combined; jail's in the basement. 

Here's the grocery store and here's Mr. Morgan's drugstore. Most everybody in 
town manages to look into those two stores once a day. 

Public School's over yonder. High School's still farther over. Quarter of nine 
mornings, noontimes, and three o'clock afternoons, the hull town can hear the 
yelling and screaming from those schoolyards. 

This is our doctor's house, Doc Gibbs'. This is the back door. 

This is Mrs. Gibbs' garden. Corn…peas...beans...hollyhocks…heliotrope… and 
a lot of burdock. 

And this is Mrs. Webb's garden. Just like Mrs. Gibbs'. Only it's got a lot of 
sunflowers, too. 

Nice town, y'know what I mean? 

Stage Manager (Continued) 

Nobody very remarkable ever come out of it, s'far as we know. The earliest 
tombstones in the cemetery up there on the mountain say 1670-1680. There 
are Grovers and Cartwrights` and Gibbses and Herseys; same names as are 
around here now. 

Well, as I said; it's about dawn. 

A train whistle is heard.                                                                   

The Stage Manager takes out his watch and nods. 

So…another day's begun. 

There's Doc Gibbs comin' down Main Street now. And here's his wife comin' 
downstairs to get breakfast. 

Mrs. Gibbs enters. 

And there comes Joe Crowell, Jr., delivering Mr. Webb's Sentinel. 

Dr. Gibbs enters.                                                                        

Joe Crowell, jr., enters down center aisle. 

Joe Crowell, Jr. 

Morning, Doc Gibbs. 

Dr. Gibbs 

 Morning, Joe. 

Joe Crowell, Jr. 

Somebody been sick, Doc? 

Dr. Gibbs 

No. Just some twins born over in Polish Town. 

Joe Crowell, Jr. 

Do you want your paper now? 

Dr. Gibbs 

Yes, I'll take it. Anything serious goin' on in the world since Wednesday? 

Joe Crowell, Jr. 

Yes sir. My schoolteacher, Miss Foster's,  getting married to a fella over in 
Concord. 

Dr. Gibbs 

I declare. How do you boys feel about that? 

Joe Crowell, Jr. 

Well, of course, it's none of my business but I think if a person starts out to be 
a teacher she ought to stay one. 

Joe exits.                                                                              

Dr. Gibbs stands reading his paper. 

Stage Manager 

Want to tell you something about that boy Joe Crowell there. Joe was awful 
bright…graduated from high school here, head of his class. So he got a 
scholarship to Massachusetts Tech. Graduated head of his class there, too. It 
was all wrote up in the Boston paper at the time. Goin' to be a great engineer, 
Joe was. But the war broke out and he died in France. All that education for 
nothing. 

Howie Newsome (Off stage) 

 Giddap, Bessie! What's the matter with you today? 

Stage Manager 

Here comes Howie Newsome, deliverin' the milk. 

Howie Newsome enters center aisle. 

Howie Newsome 

 Morning, Doc. 

Dr. Gibbs 

 Morning, Howie. 

Howie Newsome 

Somebody sick? 

Dr. Gibbs 

Pair of twins over to Mrs. Goruslawski's. 

Howie Newsome 

Twins, eh? This town's gettin' bigger every year. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Good morning, Howie. 

Howie Newsome 

Morning, Mrs. Gibbs. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Seems like you're late today. 

Howie Newsome 

Yes. Somep'n went wrong with the separator. Don't know what 'twas.  

(Turns to Dr. Gibbs.) 

Doc 

Dr. Gibbs 

Howie! 

Mrs. Gibbs (Calling upstairs). 

Children! Children! Time to get up. 

Howie Newsome 

 Come on, Bessie! 

Howie Newsome exits. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

George! Rebecca! 

Dr. Gibbs turns to Mrs. Gibbs. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Everything all right, Frank? 

Dr. Gibbs 

Yes, I declare…easy as kittens. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Set down and drink your coffee. You can catch a couple hours' sleep this 
morning, can't you? 

Dr. Gibbs 

Hm! Mrs. Wentworth's coming at eleven. Guess I know what it's about, too. Her 
strannick ain't what it ought to be. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

All told, you won't get more'n three hours' sleep. Frank Gibbs, I don't know 
what's goin' to become of you. I do wish I could get you to go away someplace 
and take a rest. I think it would do you good. 

Mrs. Webb (speaking as she enters.) 

Emileeee! Time to get up! Wally! Seven o'clock! 

Mrs. Gibbs 

I declare, you got to speak to George. Seems like something's come over him 
lately. He's no help to me at all. I can't even get him to cut me some wood. 

Dr. Gibbs 

Is he sassy to you? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

No. He just whines! All he thinks about is that baseball.  

Mrs. Gibbs shouts upstairs. 

George! Rebecca! You'll be late for school. 

 M-m-m... 

George! 

Dr. Gibbs 

George, look sharp! 

George' (Off stage) 

Yes, Pa! 

Dr. Gibbs 

Don't you hear your mother calling you? I guess I'll go upstairs and get forty 
winks. 

Dr Gibbs exits. 

Mrs. Webb 

Walleee! Emileee! You'll be late for school! Walleee! You wash yourself good or 
I'll come up and do it myself. 

Rebecca Gibbs (off stage) 

Ma! What dress shall I wear? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Don't make a noise. Your father's been out all night and needs his sleep. I 
washed and ironed the blue gingham for you special. 

Rebecca 

Ma, I hate that dress. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Oh, hush-up-with-you. 

Rebecca 

Every day I go to school dressed like a sick turkey. 

Now, Rebecca, you always look very nice. 

Rebecca 

Mama, George's throwing soap at me. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

I'll come and slap the both of you. That's what I'll do. 

A factory whistle sounds.                                                                 

The children dash in and take their places.  

Stage Manager 

We've got a factory in our town too; hear it? Makes blankets.  

Mrs. Webb 

Children! Now I won't have it. Breakfast is just as good as any other meal and I 
won't have you gobbling like wolves. It'll stunt your growth. That's a fact. Put 
away your book, Wally. 

Wally 

Aw, Ma! By ten o'clock I got to know all about Canada. 

Mrs. Webb 

You know the rule's well as I do No books at table. As for me, I'd rather have 
my children healthy than bright. 

Emily 

I'm both, Mama, You know I am. I'm the brightest girl in school for my age. I 
have a wonderful memory. 

Mrs. Webb 

Eat your breakfast. 

Wally 

I'm bright, too, when I'm looking at my stamp collection. 

I'll speak to your father about it when he's rested. Seems to me twenty-five 
cents a week's enough for a boy your age. I declare I don't know how you spend 
it all. 

George 

Aw, Ma. I gotta lotta things to buy. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Strawberry phosphates! That's what you spend it on. 

George 

I don't see how Rebecca comes to have so much money. She has more'n a 
dollar. 

Rebecca 

I've been saving it up gradual. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Well, dear, I think it's a good thing to spend some every now and then. 

Rebecca 

Mama, do you know what I love most in the world. Do you? Money. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Eat your breakfast. 

The Children (Overlapping) 

Mama, there's first bell! I gotta hurry! I don't want any more! I gotta hurry! 

George, Rebecca, Emily and Wally exit center aisle. 

Mrs. Webb 

Walk fast, but you don't have to run. Wally, pull up your pants at the knee. 
Stand up straight, Emily. 

Tell Miss Foster I send her my best congratulations. Can you remember that? 

Rebecca 

Yes, Ma.  

Mrs. Gibbs 

You look real nice, Rebecca. Pick up your feet. 

All:  

Good-by. 

Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb stand center. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Good morning, Myrtle. How's your cold? 

Mrs. Webb 

Well, I still get that tickling feeling in my throat. I told Charles I didn't know as 
I'd go to choir practice tonight. Wouldn't be any use. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Have you tried singing over your voice? 

Mrs. Webb 

Yes, but somehow I can't do that and stay on the key.  

Mrs. Gibbs 

Now, Myrtle. I've got to tell you something, because if I don't tell somebody I'll 
burst. 

Mrs. Webb 

Why, Julia Gibbs! 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Myrtle, did one of those secondhand-furniture men from Boston come to see 
you last Friday? 

No-o. 

Well, he called on me. First I thought he was a patient wantin' to see Dr. Gibbs. 
'n he wormed his way into my parlor, and, Myrtle Webb, he offered me three 
hundred fifty dollars for Grandmother Wentworth's highboy, as I'm sitting here! 

Mrs. Webb 

 Why, Julia Gibbs! 

Mrs. Gibbs 

He did! That old thing! Why, it was so big I didn't know where to put it and I 
almost give it to Cousin Hester Wilcox. 

Mrs. Webb 

Well, you're going to take it, aren't you? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

 I don't know. 

Mrs. Webb 

You don't know. Three hundred fifty dollars! What's come over you? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Well, if I could get the Doctor to take the money and go away someplace on a 
real trip, I'd sell it like that. Y'know, Myrtle, it's been the dream of my life to see 
Paris, France. It sounds crazy, I suppose, but for years I've been promising my-
self that if we ever had the chance… 

Mrs. Webb 

How does the Doctor feel about it? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Well, I did beat about the bush a little and said that if I got a legacy—that's the 
way I put it—I'd make him take me somewhere. 

M-m-m…What did he say?  

You know how he is. I haven't heard a serious word out of him since I've known 
him. No, he said, it might make him discontented with Grover's Corners to go 
traipsin' about Europe; better let well enough alone, he says.  

Mrs. Webb 

Well, if that secondhand man's really serious about buyin' it, Julia, you sell it. 
And then you'll get to see Paris, all right. Just keep droppin' hints from time to 
time; that's how I got to see the Atlantic Ocean, y'know. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Oh, I'm sorry I mentioned it. Only it seems to me that once in your life before 
you die you ought to see a country where they don't talk in English and don't 
even want to. 

Stage Manager 

Thank you, ladies. Thank you very much. 

Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb exit. 

Stage Manager 

Now we're going to skip a few hours. 

But first we want a little more information about the town, kind of a scientific 
account, you might say. So I've asked Professor Willard of our State University 
to sketch in a few details of our past history here. 

Is Professor Willard here? 

Professor Willard enters. 

May I introduce Professor Willard of our State University. 

Turns to Professor Willard 

A few brief notes, thank you, Professor,—unfortunately our time is limited 

Professor Willard 

Grover's Corners…let me see…Grover's Corners lies on the old Pleistocene 
granite of the Appalachian range. I may say it's some of the oldest land in the 
world. We're very proud of that. Some highly interesting fossils have been 
found…I may say: unique fossils…two miles out of town, in Silas Peckham's 
cow pasture. Shall I read some of Professor Gruber's notes on the 
meteorological situation…mean precipitation, et cetera? 

Stage Manager 

Afraid we won't have time for that, Professor. We might have a few words on the 
history of man here. 

Professor Willard 

Yes…anthropological data: Early Amerindian stock. Cotahatchee tribes…no 
evidence before the tenth century of this era…hmm…now entirely 
disappeared…possible traces in three families…  

Stage Manager 

And the population, Professor Willard? 

Professor Willard 

Within the town limits: 2,640. 

Stage Manager 

Just a moment, Professor. 

He whispers into the professor's ear. 

Professor Willard 

Oh, yes, indeed? The population, at the moment, is 2,642. The Postal District 
brings in 507 more, making a total of 3,149. Mortality and birth rates: 
constant. By MacPherson's gauge: 6.032. 

Stage Manager 

Thank you very much, Professor. We're all very much obliged to you, I'm sure. 

Professor Willard 

Not at all, sir; not at all. 

Stage Manager 

This way, Professor, and thank you again. 

Exit Professor Willard. 

Now the political and social report: Editor Webb. Mr. Webb? 

Mrs. Webb enters. 

Mrs. Webb 

He'll be here in a minute…He just cut his hand while he was eatin' an apple. 

Stage Manager 

Thank you, Mrs. Webb. 

Mrs. Webb  

Turns upstage and exits as she speaks. 

Charles! Everybody's waitin'. 

Stage Manager 

Mr. Webb is Publisher and Editor of the Grover's Corners Sentinel. That's our 
local paper, y'know. 

Enter Mr. Webb. 

Mr. Webb 

Well…I don't have to tell you that we're run here by a Board of Selectmen. All 
males vote at the age of twenty-one. Women vote indirect. We're lower middle 
class: sprinkling of professional men…ten per cent illiterate laborers. 
Politically, we're eighty-six per cent Republicans; six per cent Democrats; four 
per cent Socialists; rest, indifferent. Religiously, we're eighty-five per cent 
Protestants; twelve per cent Catholics; rest, indifferent. 

Stage Manager 

Have you any comments, Mr. Webb? 

Very ordinary town, if you ask me. Little better behaved than most. But our 
young people here seem to like it well enough. Ninety per cent of 'em 
graduating from high school settle down right here to live…even when they've 
been away to college. 

Stage Manager 

Now, is there anyone in the audience who would like to ask Editor Webb 
anything about the town? 

Lady in a Box 

Oh, Mr. Webb? Mr. Webb, is there any culture or love of beauty in Grover's 
Corners? 

Mr. Webb 

Well, ma'am, there ain't much; not in the sense you mean. Come to think of it, 
there's some girls that play the piano at High School Commencement; but they 
ain't happy about it. No, ma'am, there isn't much culture; but maybe this is 
the place to tell you that we've got a lot of pleasures of a kind here. We like the 
sun comin' up over the mountain in the morning and we all notice a good deal 
about the birds. We pay a lot of attention to them. And we watch the change of 
the seasons; yes, everybody knows about them.  

Mr. Webb exits. 

Stage Manager 

Thank you, Mr. Webb. Now, we'll go back to the town. It's early afternoon. All 
2,642 have had their dinners and all the dishes have been washed. There's an 
early-afternoon calm in our town…a buzzin' and a hummin' from the school 
buildings…only a few buggies on Main Street…the horses dozing at the 
hitching posts. You all remember what it's like. Doc Gibbs is in his office, 
tapping people and making them say "ah." Mr. Webb's cuttin' his lawn over 
there.  

(Shrill girls' voices are heard.) 

No, sir. It's later than I thought. There are the children coming home from 
school already. 

Emily enters. 

I can't, Lois. I've got to go home and help my mother. I promised.  

Emily, walk simply. Who do you think you are today? 

Emily 

Papa, you're terrible. One minute you tell me to stand up straight and the next 
minute you call me names. I just don't listen to you. 

She gives him an abrupt kiss. 

Mr. Webb 

Golly, I never got a kiss from such a great lady before. 

Mr. Webb exits. 

George Gibbs enters. 

George 

Hello, Emily. 

Emily 

H'lo. 

George 

You made a fine speech in class. 

Emily 

Well... I was really ready to make a speech about the Monroe Doctrine, but at 
the last minute Miss Corcoran made me talk about the Louisiana Purchase 
instead. I worked an awful long time on both of them. 

George 

Gee, it's funny, Emily. From my window up there I can just see your head 
nights when you're doing your homework over in your room. 

Why, can you? 

You certainly do stick to it, Emily. I don't see how you can sit still that long. I 
guess you like school. 

Emily 

Well, I always feel it's something you have to go through. 

George 

Yeah. 

Emily 

I don't mind it really. It passes the time. 

George 

Yeah. Emily, what do you think? We might work out a kinda telegraph from 
your window to mine; and once in a while you could give me a kinda hint or 
two about one of those algebra problems. I don't mean the answers, Emily, of 
course not . . . just some little hint... 

Emily 

Oh, I think hints are allowed. So…ah…f you get stuck George…you whistle to 
me and I'll give you some hints. 

George 

Emily, you're just naturally bright, I guess. 

Emily 

I figure that it's just the way a person's born. 

George 

Yeah. But, you see, I want to be a farmer, and my Uncle Luke says whenever 
I'm ready I can come over and work on his farm and if I'm any good I can just 
gradually have it. 

You mean the house and everything? 

Mrs. Webb enters. 

George 

Yeah. Well, thanks. I better be getting out to the baseball field. Thanks for the 
talk, Emily. Good afternoon, Mrs. Webb. 

Mrs. Webb 

Good afternoon, George. 

George 

So long, Emily. 

Emily 

So long, George. 

Mrs. Webb 

George Gibbs let himself have a real conversation, didn't he? Why, he's growing 
up. How old would George be? 

Emily 

I don't know. 

Mrs. Webb 

Let's see. He must be almost sixteen. 

Emily 

Mama, I made a speech in class today and I was very good. 

Mrs. Webb 

You must recite it to your father at supper. What was it about?  

Emily 

The Louisiana Purchase. It was like silk off a spool. I'm going to make speeches 
all my life. Mama…Mama, will you answer me a question, serious? 

Seriously, dear; not serious. 

Seriously, will you? 

Mrs. Webb 

Of course, I will. 

Emily 

Mama, am I good looking? 

Mrs. Webb 

Yes, of course you are. All my children have got good features; I'd be ashamed 
if they hadn't. 

Emily 

Oh, Mama, that's not what I mean. What I mean is: am I pretty? 

 Mrs. Webb 

I've already told you, yes. Now that's enough of that. You have a nice young 
pretty face. I never heard of such foolishness. 

Emily 

Oh, Mama, you never tell us the truth about anything. 

Mrs. Webb 

I am telling you the truth. 

Emily 

Mama, were you pretty? 

Mrs. Webb 

Yes, I was, if I do say it. I was the prettiest girl in town next to Mamie 
Cartwright. 

But, Mama, you've got to say something about me. Am I pretty enough..to get 
anybody…to get people interested in me? 

Emily, you make me tired. Now stop it. You're pretty enough for all normal 
purposes 

Emily 

Oh, Mama, you're no help at all. 

The lights gradually dim to darkness as the choir begins singing                        
"Blessed Be the Tie That Binds”. Simon Stimson directs them.                                    

.George and Emily set and mount their ‘ladders’. 

Stage Manager 

Well!...good deal of time's gone by. It's evening. You can hear choir practice 
going on in the Congregational Church. The children are at home doing their 
schoolwork. The day's running down like a tired clock. 

Simon Stimson 

Now look here, everybody. Music come into the world to give pleasure. Softer! 
Softer! Get it out of your heads that music's only good when it's loud. You leave 
loudness to the Methodists. You couldn't beat 'em, even if you wanted to. Now 
again. Tenors! 

George 

Hssst! Emily! 

Emily 

Hello. 

George 

Hello!  

Emily 

I can't work at all. The moonlight's so terrible. 

Emily, did you get the third problem? 

Which? 

George 

The third? 

Emily 

Why, yes, George. That's the easiest of them all. 

George 

I don't see it. Emily, can you give me a hint? 

Emily 

I'll tell you one thing…the answer's in yards. 

George 

In yards? How do you mean? 

Emily 

In square yards. 

George 

Oh…in square yards. 

Emily 

Yes, George, don't you see? 

George 

Yeah. 

Emily 

In square yards of wallpaper. 

Wallpaper. Oh, I see. Thanks a lot, Emily. 

You're welcome. My, isn't the moonlight terrible? And choir practice going on. I 
think if you hold your breath you can hear the train all the way to Contoocook. 
Hear it? 

George 

M-m-m…what do you know! 

Emily 

Well, I guess I better go back and try to work. 

George 

Good night, Emily. And thanks. 

Emily 

Good night, George. 

Simon Stimson 

Before I forget it; how many of you will be able to come in Tuesday afternoon 
and sing at Fred Hersey's wedding? Show your hands. That'll be fine; that'll be 
right nice. We'll do the same music we did for Jane Trowbridge's last month. 
Now we'll do, "Art Thou Weary; Art Thou Languid?" It's a question, ladies and 
gentlemen, make it talk. Ready. 

Dr. Gibbs enters. 

Dr. Gibbs 

Oh, George, can you come down a minute? 

George 

Yes, Pa. 

George descends the ladder. 

Make yourself comfortable, George; I'll only keep you a minute. George, how old 
are you? 

George 

I? I'm sixteen, almost seventeen. 

Dr. Gibbs 

What do you want to do after school's over? 

George 

Why, you know, Pa. I want to be a farmer on Uncle Luke's farm.  

Dr. Gibbs 

You'll be willing, will you, to get up early and milk and feed the stock ... and 
you'll be able to hoe and hay all day? 

George 

Sure, I will. What are you…what do you mean, Pa? 

Dr. Gibbs 

Well, George, while I was in my office today I heard a funny sound…and what 
do you think it was? It was your mother chopping wood. There you see your 
mother…getting up early; cooking meals all day long; washing and ironing and 
still she has to go out in the back yard and chop wood. I suppose she just got 
tired of asking you. She just gave up and decided it was easier to do it herself. 
And you eat her meals, and put on the clothes she keeps nice for you, and you 
run off and play baseball…like she's some hired girl we keep around the house 
but that we don't like very much. Well, I knew all I had to do was call your 
attention to it. Here's a handkerchief, son. George, I've decided to raise your 
spending money twenty-five cents a week. Not, of course, for chopping wood for 
your mother, because that's a present you give her, but because you're getting 
older and I imagine there are lots of things you must find to do with it. 

George 

Thanks, Pa. 

Let's see…tomorrow's your payday. You can count on it. Hmm. Probably 
Rebecca'll feel she ought to have some more too. Wonder what could have 
happened to your mother. Choir practice never was as late as this before. 

George 

It's only half past eight, Pa. 

Dr. Gibbs 

I don't know why she's in that old choir. She hasn't any more voice than an old 
crow… Traipsin' around the streets at this hour of the night...just about time 
you retired, don't you think? 

George 

Yes, Pa. 

George mounts to his place on the ladder.                                                     

Laughter and good nights can be heard from the Choir members. Mrs. Gibbs, 

Mrs. Soames and Mrs. Webb come down Main Street. They stop. 

Mrs. Soames (to off stage) 

Good night, Martha. Good night, Mr. Foster. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Real nice choir practice, wa'n't it? (Pause) Myrtle Webb! Look at that moon, will 
you! Potato weather, for sure. 

The three are silent a moment, gazing up at the moon. 

Mrs. Soames 

Naturally I didn't want to say a word about it in front of those others, but now 
we're alone…really, it's the worst scandal that ever was in this town! 

Mrs. Gibbs 

 What? 

Mrs. Soames:  

Simon Stimson! 

 Now, Louella! 

Mrs. Soames: 

But, Julia! To have the organist of a church drink and drunk year after year. 
You know he was drunk tonight. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Now, Louella! We all know about Mr. Stimson, and we all know about the 
troubles he's been through, and Dr. Ferguson knows too, and if Dr. Ferguson 
keeps him on there in his job the only thing the rest of us can do is just not to 
notice it. 

Mrs. Soames 

Not to notice it! But it's getting worse. 

Mrs. Webb 

No, it isn't, Louella. It's getting better. I've been in that choir twice as long as 
you have. It doesn't happen anywhere near so often. 

They look at the moon in silence. 

My, I hate to go to bed on a night like this. I better hurry. Those children'll be 
sitting up till all hours. Good night, Louella. 

They all exchange good nights. Mrs. Webb and Mrs. Soames exit. Mrs. Gibbs 

and Dr. Gibbs meet at center. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Well, we had a real good time. 

Dr. Gibbs 

You're late enough. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Why, Frank, it ain't any later 'n usual. 

Dr. Gibbs 

And you stopping at the corner to gossip with a lot of hens. 

Now, Frank, don't be grouchy. Just smell the heliotrope in the moonlight. Isn't 
that wonderful? What did you do all the time I was away? 

Dr. Gibbs 

Oh, I read. As usual. What were the girls gossiping about tonight? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Well, believe me, Frank, there is something to gossip about. 

Dr. Gibbs 

Hmm! Simon Stimson far gone, was he? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Worst I've ever seen him. How'll that end, Frank? Dr. Ferguson can't forgive 
him forever. 

Dr. Gibbs 

I guess I know more about Simon Stimson's affairs than anybody in this town. 
Some people ain't made for small-town life. I don't know how that'll end; but 
there's nothing we can do but just leave it alone. Come, get in. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

No, not yet…Frank, I'm worried about you. 

Dr. Gibbs 

What are you worried about? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

I think it's my duty to make plans for you to get a real rest and change. And if I 
get that legacy, well, I'm going to insist on it, 

Dr. Gibbs 

Now, Julia, there's no sense in going over that again. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Frank, you're just unreasonable! 

Starting into the house. 

Come on, Julia, it's getting late. First thing you know you'll catch cold. I gave 
George a piece of my mind tonight. I reckon you'll have your wood chopped for 
a while anyway. Now, let’s get upstairs. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

You know, Frank, Mrs. Fairchild always locks her front door every night. All 
those people up that part of town do. 

Dr. Gibbs 

They're all getting citified, that's the trouble with them. They haven't got 
nothing fit to burgle and everybody knows it. 

Dr Gibbs and Mrs. Gibbs exit.                                                             

Rebecca climbs up the ladder beside George. 

George 

Get out, Rebecca. There's only room for one at this window. You're always 
spoiling everything. 

Rebecca 

Well, let me look just a minute. 

George 

Use your own window. 

Rebecca 

I did, but there's no moon there…George, do you know what I think…do you? I 
think maybe the moon's getting nearer and nearer and there'll be a big 
'splosion. 

George 

Rebecca, you don't know anything. If the moon were getting nearer, the guys 
that sit up all night with telescopes would see it first and they'd tell about it, 
and it'd be in all the newspapers. 

Rebecca 

George, is the moon shining on South America, Canada and half the whole 
world? 

George 

Well…prob'ly is. 

The sound of crickets is heard. 

Stage Manager 

Nine thirty. Most of the lights are out. No, there's Constable Warren trying a 
few doors on Main Street. And here comes Editor Webb, after putting his 
newspaper to bed. 

Constable Warren and Mr. Webb enter. 

Mr. Webb 

Good evening, Bill. 

Constable Warren 

Evenin', Mr. Webb. 

Mr. Webb 

Quite a moon! 

Constable Warren  

Yepp. 

Mr. Webb 

All quiet tonight? 

Constable Warren 

Simon Stimson is rollin' around a little. Just saw his wife movin' out to hunt 
for him so I looked the other way. There he is now. 

Simon Stimson enters, only a trace of unsteadiness in his walk. 

Good evening, Simon . . . Town seems to have settled down for the night pretty 
well. . . . 

Simon Stimson faces Mr.Webb, stares at him, swaying slightly. 

Mr. Webb (Continued) 

Yes, most of the town's settled down for the night, Simon.... I guess we better 
do the same. Can I walk along a ways with you? 

Simon Stimson exits without a word. 

Mr. Webb (Continued) 

Good night. 

Constable Warren 

I don't know how that's goin' to end, Mr. Webb. 

Mr. Webb 

Well, he's seen a peck of trouble, one thing after another. Well, good night, Bill. 

Constable Warren 

Good night, Mr. Webb. 

Constable Warren exits. 

Mr. Webb 

Who's that up there? Is that you, Myrtle? 

Emily 

No, it's me, Papa. 

Mr. Webb 

Why aren't you in bed? 

Emily 

I don't know. I just can't sleep yet, Papa. The moonlight's so wonderful. And the 
smell of Mrs. Gibbs' heliotrope. Can you smell it? 

Hm…Yes. Haven't any troubles on your mind, have you, Emily? 

Troubles, Papa? No. 

Mr. Webb 

Well, enjoy yourself, but don't let your mother catch you. Good night, Emily. 

Good night, Papa. 

Mr. Webb exits, whistling "Blessed Be the Tie That Binds". 

Rebecca 

I never told you about that letter Jane Crofut got from her minister when she 
was sick. He wrote Jane a letter and on the envelope the address was like this: 
It said: Jane Crofut; The Crofut Farm; Grover's Corners; Sutton County; New 
Hampshire; United States of America. 

George 

What's funny about that? 

Rebecca 

But listen, it's not finished: the United States of America; Continent of North 
America; Western Hemisphere; the Earth; the Solar System; the Universe; the 
Mind of God…that's what it said on the envelope. 

George 

What do you know! 

Rebecca 

And the postman brought it just the same. 

 George 

What do you know! 

Lights dim to black as George and Emily replace their ladders.                             

The Choir sings. Lights fade up to full. 

Stage Manager 

Three years have gone by. Yes, the sun's come up over a thousand times. 

Some babies that weren't even born before have begun talking regular 
sentences already; and a number of people who thought they were right young 
and spry have noticed that they can't bound up a flight of stairs like they used 
to, without their heart fluttering a little. 

All that can happen in a thousand days. 

Nature's been pushing and contriving in other ways, too: a number of young 
people fell in love and got married.  Almost everybody in the world gets 
married. In our town there aren't hardly any exceptions. Most everybody in the 
world climbs into their graves married. 

So, it's three years later. It's 1904. 

It's July 7th, just after High School Commencement. That's the time most of 
our young people jump up and get married. Soon as they've passed their last 
examinations in solid geometry and Cicero's Orations, looks like they suddenly 
feel themselves fit to be married. 

It's early morning. Only this time it's been raining. It's been pouring and 
thundering. 

There! You can hear the 5:45 for Boston. 

Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb enter. 

And there's Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb come down to make breakfast, just as 
though it were an ordinary day. I don't have to point out to the women in my 
audience that those ladies they see before them, both of those ladies cooked 
three meals a day—one of 'em for twenty years, the other for forty—and no 
summer vacation. They brought up two children apiece, washed, cleaned the 
house,—and never a nervous breakdown. It's like what one of those Middle 
West poets said: You've got to love life to have life, and you've got to have life to 
love life.. .. It's what they call a vicious circle. 

Here comes Howie Newsome delivering the milk. And there's Si Crowell 
delivering the papers like his brother before him. 

Si Crowell and Howie Newsome enter. 

Si Crowell 

Morning, Howie. 

Howie Newsome 

Morning, Si. Anything in the papers I ought to know? 

Si Crowell 

Nothing much, except we're losing about the best baseball pitcher Grover's 
Corners ever had…George Gibbs. 

Howie Newsome 

 Reckon he is. 

Si Crowell 

I don't see how he could give up a thing like that just to get married. Would 
you, Howie? 

Howie Newsome 

Can't tell, Si. Never had no talent that way. 

Constable Warren enters.  

 You're up early, Bill. 

Constable Warren 

Seein’ if there's anything I can do to prevent a flood. River's been risin' all 
night. 

Howie Newsome 

Si Crowell's all worked up here about George Gibbs' retiring from baseball. 

Constable Warren 

Yes, sir; that's the way it goes. Back in '84 we had a player, Si, even George 
Gibbs couldn't touch him. Name of Hank Todd. Went down to Maine and 
become a parson. Wonderful ball player. Howie, how does the weather look to 
you? 

Howie Newsome 

Oh, 'tain't bad. Think maybe it'll clear up for good. 

Constable Warren and Si Crowell exit. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Good morning, Howie. Do you think it's going to rain again? 

Howie Newsome 

Morning, Mrs. Gibbs. It rained so heavy, I think maybe it'll clear up. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Certainly hope it will. 

Howie Newsome 

How much did you want today? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

I'm going to have a houseful of relations, Howie. Looks to me like I'll need 
three-a-milk and two-a-cream. 

Howie Newsome 

My wife says to tell you we both hope they'll be very happy, Mrs. Gibbs. Know 
they will. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Thanks a lot, Howie.  

Howie Newsome 

Howie Newsome crosses to Mrs. Webb. 

Morning, Mrs. Webb. 

Mrs. Webb 

Oh, good morning, Mr. Newsome. I told you four quarts of milk, but I hope you 
can spare me another. 

Howie Newsome 

Yes'm…and the two of cream. 

Mrs. Webb 

Will it start raining again, Mr. Newsome? 

Howie Newsome 

Well…just sayin' to Mrs. Gibbs as how it may lighten up. Mrs. Newsome told 
me to tell you as how we hope they'll both be very happy, Mrs. Webb. Know 
they will. 

Mrs. Webb 

Thank you, and thank Mrs. Newsome 

Howie Newsome exits.   Dr. Gibbs enters. 

Dr. Gibbs 

Well, Ma, the day has come. You're losin' one of your chicks. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Frank Gibbs, don't you say another word. I feel like crying every minute.  

Dr. Gibbs 

The groom's up shaving himself. Only there ain't an awful lot to shave. 
Whistling and singing, like he's glad to leave us. Every now and then he says "I 
do" to the mirror, but it don't sound convincing to me. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

I declare, Frank, I don't know how he'll get along. I've arranged his clothes and 
seen to it he's put warm things on. (Pause) Frank! they're too young. Emily 
won't think of such things. He'll catch his death of cold within a week. 

Dr. Gibbs 

I was remembering my wedding morning, Julia. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Now don't start that, Frank Gibbs. 

I was the scaredest young fella in the State of New Hampshire. I thought I'd 
made a mistake for sure. And when I saw you comin' down that aisle I thought 
you were the prettiest girl I'd ever seen; but the only trouble was that I'd never 
seen you before. There I was in the Congregational Church marryin' a total 
stranger. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

And how do you think I felt! (Pause) Frank, weddings are perfectly awful things. 
Farces, that's what they are! 

Dr. Gibbs 

How'd you sleep last night, Julia? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Well, I heard a lot of the hours struck off. 

Dr. Gibbs 

Ye-e-s! I get a shock every time I think of George setting out to be a family 
man…that great gangling thing! I tell you Julia, there's nothing so terrifying in 
the world as a son. The relation of father and son is the darndest, 
awkwardest… 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Well, mother and daughter's no picnic, let me tell you. 

Dr. Gibbs 

They'll have a lot of troubles, I suppose, but that's none of our business. 
Everybody has a right to their own troubles. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Yes…people are meant to go through life two by two. 'Tain't natural to be 
lonesome. 

Pause. Dr. Gibb starts laughing. 

Dr. Gibbs 

Julia, do you know one of the things I was scared of when I married you? 

Oh, go along with you! 

Dr. Gibbs 

I was afraid we wouldn't have material for conversation more'n'd last us a few 
weeks. I was afraid we'd run out and eat our meals in silence, that's a fact. 
Well, you and I been conversing for twenty years now without any noticeable 
barren spells. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Well, good weather, bad weather, 'tain't very choice, but I always find 
something to say. Did you hear Rebecca stirring around upstairs? 

Dr. Gibbs 

No. Only day of the year Rebecca hasn't been managing everybody's business 
up there. She's hiding in her room. I got the impression she's crying. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Lord's sakes! This has got to stop. Rebecca! Rebecca! Come down here. 

George enters. 

George 

Good morning, everybody. Only five more hours to live. 

George turns to exit 

Mrs. Gibbs 

George Gibbs, where are you going? 

George 

Just stepping across the grass to see my girl. 

George turns to exit. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Now, George! You put on your overshoes. It's raining torrents. You don't go out 
of this house without you're prepared for it. 

Aw, Ma. It's just a step! 

George! You'll catch your death of cold and cough all through the service. 

Dr. Gibbs 

George, do as your mother tells you! 

Dr. Gibbs exits. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

From tomorrow on you can kill yourself in all weathers, but while you're in my 
house you'll live wisely, thank you. 

George 

Be back in a minute. 

George turns to Mrs. Webb. 

Mrs. Webb 

Goodness! You frightened me! Now, George, you can come in a minute, but you 
know I can't ask you in. 

George 

Why not? 

Mr. Webb enters. 

Mrs. Webb 

George, you know's well as I do: the groom can't see his bride on his wedding 
day, not until he sees her in church. 

George 

Aw, that's just a superstition. Good morning, Mr. Webb.  

Mr. Webb 

Good morning, George. 

Mr. Webb, you don't believe in that superstition, do you? 

Mr. Webb 

There's a lot of common sense in some superstitions, George.  

Mrs. Webb 

Millions have folla'd it, George, and you don't want to be the first to fly in the 
face of custom. 

George 

How is Emily? 

Mrs. Webb 

She hasn't waked up yet. I haven't heard a sound out of her. 

George 

Emily's asleep!!! 

Mrs. Webb 

No wonder! We were up 'til all hours, sewing and packing. Now I'll tell you what 
I'll do; I'll go upstairs and see she doesn't come down and surprise you.  

Mrs. Webb exits. 

Mr.Webb                                                                         

Well, George, how are you? 

George 

Oh, fine, I'm fine. Mr. Webb, what sense could there be in a superstition like 
that? 

Mr. Webb 

Well, you see,; on her wedding morning a girl's head's apt to be full of…clothes 
and one thing and another. Don't you think that's probably it? 

Ye-e-s. I never thought of that. Mr. Webb. A girl's apt to be a mite nervous on 
her wedding day. I wish a fellow could get married without all that marching up 
and down. 

Mr. Webb 

Every man that's ever lived has felt that way about it, George; but it hasn't 
been any use. It's the womenfolk who've built up weddings, my boy. For a while 
now the women have it all their own. A man looks pretty small at a wedding, 
George. All those good women standing shoulder to shoulder making sure that 
the knot's tied in a mighty public way. 

George 

But…you believe in it, don't you, Mr. Webb? 

Mr. Webb 

Oh, yes; oh, yes. Don't you misunderstand me, my boy. Marriage is a 
wonderful thing; wonderful thing. And don't you forget that, George. 

George 

No, sir. Mr. Webb, how old were you when you got married? 

Mr. Webb 

Oh, age hasn't much to do with it, George. Not compared with…uh…other 
things. 

George 

What were you going to say, Mr. Webb? 

Mr. Webb 

Oh, I don't know. Was I going to say something? 

George, I was thinking the other night of some advice my father gave me when I 
got married. Charles, he said, Charles, start out early showing who's boss, he 
said. Best thing to do is to give an order, even if it don't make sense; just so 
she'll learn to obey. And he said: if anything about your wife irritates you…her 
conversation, or anything…just get up and leave the house. That'll make it 
clear to her, he said. And, oh, yes! he said never, never let your wife know how 
much money you have, never. 

Well, Mr. Webb ... I don't think I could…  

Mr. Webb 

So I took the opposite of my father's advice and I've been happy ever since. And 
let that be a lesson to you, George, never to ask advice on personal matters. 

Mrs. Webb enters. 

Mrs. Webb 

George, Emily's got to come downstairs and eat her breakfast. She sends you 
her love but she doesn't want to lay eyes on you. Good-by. 

George 

Good-by. 

George exits. 

Mr. Webb 

Myrtle, I guess you don't know about that older superstition. 

Mrs. Webb 

What do you mean, Charles? 

Mr. Webb 

Since the cave men, no bridegroom should see his father-in-law on the day of 
the wedding, or near it. Now remember that. 

Mr, and Mrs. Webb exit. 

Stage Manager 

Now I have to interrupt again here. You see, we want to know how all this 
began…this plan to spend a lifetime together. You know how it is; you're 
twenty-one or twenty-two and you make some decisions; then whisssh! you're 
seventy… you've been a lawyer for fifty years and that white-haired lady at your 
side has eaten over fifty thousand meals with you. How do such things begin? 

Stage Manager (Continued) 

George and Emily are going to show you now the conversation they had when 
they first knew that...that...as the saying goes…that they were meant for one 
another. But before they do it I want you to try and remember what it was like 
to have been very young. 

And particularly the days when you were first in love; when you were like a 
person sleep-walking. You're just a little bit crazy. Will you remember that, 
please? Now they'll be coming out of high school at three o'clock. George has 
just been elected President of the Junior Class, and as it's June, that means 
he'll be President of the Senior Class all next year. And Emily's just been 
elected Secretary and Treasurer. I don't have to tell you how important that is. 

Emily enters. 

Emily (To off-stage) 

I can't, Louise. I've got to go home. Good-by. Oh, Ernestine! Ernestine! Can you 
come over tonight and do Latin? Isn't that Cicero the worst thing! Tell your 
mother you have to. G'by. G'by, Helen. G'by, Fred. 

George, enters. 

George 

Can I carry your books home for you, Emily? 

Emily (Coolly)   

Why . . . uh . . . Thank you. It isn't far. 

Silence 

George 

I'm awfully glad you were elected, too, Emily. 

Emily 

Thank you. 

George 

Emily, why are you mad at me? 

I'm not mad at you. 

You've been treating me so funny lately. 

Emily 

Well, since you ask me, I might as well say it right out, George, I don't like the 
whole change that's come over you in the last year. I'm sorry if that hurts your 
feelings, but I've got to—tell the truth and shame the devil. 

George 

A change? Wha…what do you mean? 

Emily 

Well, up to a year ago I used to like you a lot. And I used to watch you as you 
did everything…because we'd been friends so long…and then you began 
spending all your time at baseball…and you never stopped to speak to anybody 
any more. Not even to your own family you didn't…and, George, it's a fact… 
you've got awful conceited and stuck-up, and all the girls say so. They may not 
say so to your face, but that's what they say about you behind your back, and 
it hurts me to hear them say it; but I've got to agree with them a little. I'm sorry 
if it hurts your feelings…but I can't be sorry I said it. 

George 

I…I'm glad you said it, Emily. I never thought that such a thing was happening 
to me. I guess it's hard for a fella not to have faults creep into his character. 

Emily 

I always expect a man to be perfect and I think he should be. 

George 

Oh, I don't think it's possible to be perfect, Emily. 

Emily 

Well, my father is, and as far as I can see, your father is. There's no reason on 
earth why you shouldn't be, too. 

Well, I feel it's the other way round. That men aren't naturally good; but girls 
are. 

Emily 

Well, you might as well know right now that I'm not perfect. It's not as easy for 
a girl to be perfect as a man, because we girls are more…more…nervous. Now 
I'm sorry I said all that about you. I don't know what made me say it. 

George 

Emily… 

Emily 

Now I can see it's not the truth at all. And I suddenly feel that it isn't 
important, anyway. 

George 

Emily…would you like an ice-cream soda, or something, before you go home? 

Emily 

Well, thank you…I would. 

The Stage Manager, as Mr. Morgan, enters. 

Stage Manager 

Hello, George. Hello, Emily. What'll you have? Why, Emily Webb, what you 
been crying about? 

George 

She…she just got an awful scare, Mr. Morgan. She almost got run over by that 
hardware-store wagon. Everybody says that Tom Huckins drives like a crazy 
man. 

Stage Manager 

Well, now! You look all shook up. I tell you, you've got to look both ways before 
you cross Main Street these days. Gets worse every year. What'll you have? 

I'll have a strawberry phosphate, thank you, Mr. Morgan. 

No, no, Emily. Have an ice-cream soda with me. Two strawberry ice-cream 
sodas, Mr. Morgan. 

Stage Manager 

Two strawberry ice-cream sodas, yes sir. There they are. Enjoy 'em. 

The Stage Manager exits. 

Emily 

They're so expensive. 

George 

No, no. Don't you think of that. We're celebrating our election. And then do you 
know what else I'm celebrating? 

Emily 

Nnn-no, 

George 

I'm celebrating because I've got a friend who tells me all the things that ought 
to be told me. 

Emily 

George, please don't think of that. I don't know why I said it. It's not true. 
You're… 

George 

No, Emily, you stick to it. I'm glad you spoke to me like you did. But you'll see; 
I'm going to change so quick; you bet I'm going to change. And, Emily, I want to 
ask you a favor. 

Emily 

What? 

Emily, if I go away to State Agriculture College next year, will you write me a 
letter once in a while? 

Emily 

I certainly will. I certainly will, George  

Pause. 

It certainly seems like being away three years you'd get out of touch with 
things. Maybe letters from Grover's Corners wouldn't be so interesting after a 
while. Grover's Corners isn't a very important place when you think of all New 
Hampshire; but I think it's a very nice town. 

George 

The day wouldn't come when I wouldn't want to know everything that's 
happening here. I know that's true, Emily. 

Emily 

Well, I'll try to make my letters interesting.  

Pause. 

George 

Y'know. Emily, whenever I meet a farmer I ask him if he thinks it's important to 
go to Agriculture School to be a good farmer. 

Emily 

Why, George… 

George 

Yeah, and some of them say that it's even a waste of time. You can get all those 
things, anyway, out of the pamphlets the government sends out. And Uncle 
Luke's getting old; he's about ready for me to start in taking over his farm 
tomorrow, if I could. 

Emily 

My! 

And, like you say, being gone all that time…in other places and meeting other 
people. Gosh, if anything like that can happen I don't want to go away. I guess 
new people aren't any better than old ones. I'll bet they almost never are.          
Emily ... I feel that you're as good a friend as I've got. I don't need to go and 
meet the people in other towns. 

Emily 

But, George, maybe it's very important for you to go and learn all that about 
cattle judging and soils and those things. Of course, I don't know. 

George 

Emily, I'm going to make up my mind right now. I won't go. I'll tell Pa about it 
tonight. 

Emily 

Why, George, I don't see why you have to decide right now. It's a whole year 
away. 

George 

Emily, I'm glad you spoke to me about that…that fault in my character. What 
you said was right; but there was one thing wrong in it, and that was when you 
said that for a year I wasn't noticing people, and...you, for instance. Why, you 
say you were watching me when I did everything…I was doing the same about 
you all the time. Why, sure, I always thought about you as one of the chief 
people I thought about. I always made sure where you were sitting on the 
bleachers, and who you were with, and for three days now I've been trying to 
walk home with you; but something's always got in the way. Yesterday I was 
standing over against the wall waiting for you, and you walked home with Miss 
Corcoran. 

Emily 

George…Life's awful funny! How could I have known that? Why, I thought… 

George 

Listen, Emily, I'm going to tell you why I'm not going to Agriculture School. I 
think that once you've found a person that you're very fond of…I mean a 
person who's fond of you, too, and likes you enough to be interested in your 
character…Well, I think that's just as important as college is, and even more 
so. That's what I think. 

I think it's awfully important, too. 

Emily. 

Emily 

Y-yes, George. 

George 

Emily, if I do improve and make a big change…would you be… I mean: could 
you be… 

Emily 

I…I am now; I always have been. 

George. 

So I guess this is an important talk we've been having. 

Emily 

Yes…yes. 

George 

Wait just a minute and I'll walk you home. 

With mounting alarm George digs into his pockets for the money.                               

The Stage Manager enters. 

George  

Mr. Morgan, I'll have to go home and get the money to pay you for this. It'll only 
take me a minute. 

Stage Manager                                                                 

(Pretending to be affronted.) 

What's that? George Gibbs, do you mean to tell me… 

Yes, but I had reasons, Mr. Morgan. Look, here's my gold watch to keep until I 
come back with the money. 

Stage Manager 

That's all right. Keep your watch. I'll trust you. 

George 

I'll be back in five minutes. 

Stage Manager 

I'll trust you ten years, George…not a day over. Got all over your shock, Emily? 

Emily 

Yes, thank you, Mr. Morgan. It was nothing. 

George 

I'm ready. 

George and Emily exit in silence.                                                           

The Stage Manager watches, then turns to the audience. 

Stage Manager 

Well. Now we're ready to get on with the wedding. 

There are a lot of things to be said about a wedding; there are a lot of thoughts 
that go on during a wedding. We can't get them all into one wedding, naturally, 
and especially not into a wedding at Grover's Corners, where they're awfully 
plain and short. 

Mrs. Webb (To Audience) 

I don't know why on earth I should be crying. I suppose there's nothing to cry 
about. It came over me at breakfast this morning; there was Emily eating her 
breakfast as she's done for seventeen years and now she's going off to eat it in 
someone else's house. Oh, I've got to say it: you know, there's something 
downright cruel about sending our girls out into marriage this way. I hope 
some of her girl friends have told her a thing or two. It's cruel, I know, but I 
couldn't bring myself to say anything. I went into it blind as a bat myself. 

George enters center aisle. 

The Choir starts singing "Love Divine, All Love Excelling”. George takes a few 

steps of withdrawal 

Mrs. Gibbs                                                                        

(sensing his confusion) 

George! George! What's the matter? 

George 

Ma, I don't want to grow old. Why's everybody pushing me so? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Why, George…you wanted it. 

George 

No, Ma, listen to me… 

Mrs. Gibbs 

No, no, George…you're a man now. 

George 

Listen, Ma, for the last time I ask you…all I want to do is to be a fella… 

Mrs. Gibbs 

George! If anyone should hear you! Now stop. Why, I'm ashamed of you! 

George                                                                       

He comes to himself and looks over the scene. 

Where's Emily? 

Mrs..Gibbs                                                                    

George! You gave me such a turn. 

George 

Cheer up, Ma. I'm getting married. 

Emily, enters center aisle. She draws back, frightened.                                          

The choir begins: "Blessed Be the Tie That Binds." 

Emily 

I never felt so alone in my whole life. And George over there, looking so…I hate 
him. I wish I were dead. Papa! Papa! 

Mr. Webb 

Emily! Emily! Now don't get upset, 

Emily 

But, Papa, I don't want to get married. 

Mr. Webb 

Shh…shh…Emily. Everything's all right. 

Emily 

Why can't I stay for a while just as I am? Let's go away. 

Mr. Webb 

No, no, Emily. Now stop and think a minute. 

Emily 

Don't you remember that you used to say…all the time you used to say…all the 
time…that I was your girl! There must be lots of places we can go to. 

Mr. Webb 

Shh…You mustn't think of such things. You're just nervous, Emily. 

                          Mr. Webb turns and calls to George. 

 George! George!  

Mr. Webb turns back to Emily. 

Why you're marrying the best young fellow in the world. George is a fine fellow. 

Emily 

But Papa… 

I'm giving away my daughter, George. Do you think you can take care of her? 

Mr. Webb, I want to…I want to try. Emily, I'm going to do my best. I love you, 
Emily. I need you. 

Emily 

Well, if you love me, help me. All I want is someone to love me. 

George 

I will, Emily. Emily, I’ll try.  

Emily 

And I mean forever. Do you hear? Forever and ever. 

The Choir sings The March from Lohengrin .                                                  

The Stage Manager, as Clergyman, stands up center. 

Mr. Webb 

Come, they're waiting for us. Now you know it'll be all right. Come, quick. 

George takes his place beside the Stage Manager-Clergyman.                               

Emily proceeds up the aisle on Mr. Webb’s arm. 

Stage Manager 

Do you, George, take this woman, Emily, to be your wedded wife, to have… 

The Stage Manager’s words are covered by the sound of the Choir singing. 

George 

I do. 

Stage Manager 

Do you, Emily, take this man, George, to be your wedded husband… 

Again, the Stage Manager’s words are covered by the Choir singing.                      

Emily and George exit the center aisle. 

The lights dim to black as the Choir’s singing fades and eight ladder-back chairs 

are placed in two openly spaced rows facing the audience. Once they are in 
place, the actors enter and take their places. The front row contains an empty 

chair; then Mrs. Gibbs and Simon Stimson. The second row contains Mrs. Soames 

and Wally Webb. 

The Stage Manager enters as the lights come up slowly. 

Stage Manager 

Nine years have gone by, friends…summer, 1913. 

Gradual changes in Grover's Corners. Horses are getting rarer. Farmers coming 
into town in Fords. Everybody locks their house doors now at night. Ain't been 
any burglars in town yet, but everybody's heard about 'em. 

You'd be surprised, though; on the whole, things don't change much around 
here. 

This is certainly an important part of Grover's Corners. It's on a hilltop…lots of 
sky, lots of clouds…often lots of sun and moon and stars. 

There, quite a ways down, is Grover's Corners. Yes, beautiful spot up here. 
Mountain laurel and li-lacks. Over there are the old stones; 1670, 1680. 
Strong-minded people that come a long way to be independent. Over there are 
some Civil War veterans. New Hampshire boys.  

This here is the new part of the cemetery. Here's your friend Mrs. Gibbs. 'N let 
me see…Here's Mr. Stimson. And Mrs. Soames. Oh, and a lot of others. And 
Editor Webb's boy, Wallace, whose appendix burst while he was on a Boy Scout 
trip to Crawford Notch. 

Now there are some things we all know, but we don't take'm out and look at'm 
very often. We all know that something is eternal…everybody knows in their 
bones that something is eternal, and that something has to do with human 
beings. There's something way down deep that's eternal about every human 
being. 

Pause. 

Well! There are some living people. There's Joe Stoddard, our undertaker, 
supervising a new-made grave. And here comes a Grover's Corners boy that  
left town to go out West. 

Joe Stoddard and, Sam Craig enter. 

Sam Craig 

Good afternoon, Joe Stoddard. 

Joe Stoddard 

Good afternoon. Let me see now…do I know you? 

Sam Craig 

I'm Sam Craig. 

Joe Stoddard 

Gracious sakes' alive! Of all people! I should'a knowed you'd be back for the 
funeral. You've been away a long time, Sam. 

Sam Craig 

Yes, I'm in business out in Buffalo now, Joe.  

Joe Stoddard 

Very sad, our journey today, Samuel. 

Sam Craig 

Yes. 

Joe Stoddard 

Yes, yes. I always say I hate to supervise when a young person is taken.  

Sam Craig  

Why, this is my Aunt Julia...I'd forgotten that she'd… 

Joe Stoddard 

Yes, Doc Gibbs lost his wife two…three years ago about this time. And today's 
another pretty bad blow for him, too. 

Mrs. Gibbs:                                                                       

(To Simon Stimson) 

That's my sister Carey's boy, Sam…Sam Craig. 

Simon Stimson 

 I'm always uncomfortable when they're around. 

Simon. 

Sam Craig 

Joe, what did she die of? 

Joe Stoddard 

Who? 

Sam Craig 

My cousin. 

Joe Stoddard 

Oh, didn't you know? Had some trouble bringing a baby into the world. 'Twas 
her second, though. There's a little boy 'bout four years old. 

Sam Craig 

The grave's going to be over there? 

 
Joe Stoddard 
 

Yes,  

Howie Newsome, Constable Warren, Si Crowell enter followed by Dr. Gibbs, 

George, Mr. Webb and Mrs. Webb. All carry large umbrellas that conceal Emily. 

The mourners slowly move down the center aisle. 

Mrs. Soames 

Who is it, Julia? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

 My daughter-in-law, Emily Webb. 

Mrs. Soames 

Well, I declare! The road up here must have been awful muddy. What did she 
die of, Julia? 

In childbirth. 

Mrs. Soames 

Childbirth. I'd forgotten all about that. My, wasn't life awful…and wonderful. 

Simon Stimson 

Wonderful, was it? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Simon! Now, remember! 

The Choir sings "Blessed Be the Tie That Binds".                                               

Emily walks slowly to the vacant chair beside Mrs. Gibbs and sits.  

Emily 

Hello. 

Mrs. Soames 

Hello, Emily. 

Emily 

 Hello, Mother Gibbs. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Emily. 

Emily 

It's raining. 

Emily looks at the mourners                                                               

who divide on either side of the graveyard. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

 Yes. They'll be gone soon, dear. Just rest yourself. 

It seems thousands and thousands of years since I…Papa remembered that 
that was my favorite hymn. Oh, I wish I'd been here a long time. I don't like 
being new here…How do you do, Mr. Stimson? 

Simon Stimson 

How do you do, Emily. 

Emily 

Mother Gibbs, George and I have made that farm into just the best place you 
ever saw. We thought of you all the time. We wanted to show you the new barn 
and a great long cement drinking fountain for the stock. We bought that out of 
the money you left us. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

I did? 

Emily 

Don't you remember, Mother Gibbs…the legacy you left us? Why, it was over 
three hundred fifty dollars. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Yes, yes, Emily. 

Emily 

Well, there's a patent device on the drinking fountain so that it never overflows, 
Mother Gibbs, and it never sinks below a certain mark they have there. It's 
fine. 

Emily’s voice trails off as she looks at the mourners. 

It won't be the same to George without me, but it's a lovely farm. 

Emily looks directly at Mrs. Gibbs. 

Live people don't understand, do they? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

No, dear…not very much. 

They're sort of shut up in little boxes, aren't they? I feel as though I knew them 
last a thousand years ago.  

My boy is spending the day with Mrs. Carter.  

Mother Gibbs, we have a Ford, too. Never gives any trouble. I don't drive, 
though.  

Mother Gibbs, when does this feeling go away? Of being…one of them? How 
long does it…? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

 Shh! dear. Just wait and be patient. 

Emily 

 I know. Look, they're finished. They're going. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

 Shh—. 

The mourners exit except Dr. Gibbs and George.                                               

Dr. Gibbs comes over to Mrs. Gibbs’ grave and stands before it a moment.           

Emily looks up at his face. Mrs. Gibbs does not raise her eyes. 

Emily 

Look! Father Gibbs is bringing some of my flowers to you. He looks just like 
George, doesn't he? Oh, Mother Gibbs, I never realized before how troubled and 
how . . . how in the dark live persons are. Look at him. I loved him so. From 
morning till night, that's all they are…roubled. 

The Dead                                                                         

(Talking among themselves) 

Little cooler than it was. Yes, that rain's cooled it off a little. Those northeast 
winds always do the same thing, don't they? If it isn't a rain, it's a three-day 
blow. 

Emily 

But, Mother Gibbs, one can go back; one can go back there again…into living. I 
feel it. I know it. Why just then for a moment I was thinking about...about the 
farm…and for a minute I was there and… 

Yes, of course you can. 

I can go back there and live all those days over again...why not? 

 Mrs. Gibbs 

All I can say is, Emily, don't. 

Emily                                                                            

(To the Stage Manager) 

But it's true, isn't it? I can go and live...back there...again. 

Stage Manager 

Yes, some have tried but they soon come back here. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Don't do it, Emily. 

Mrs. Soames 

Emily, don't. It's not what you think it'd be. 

Emily 

But I won't live over a sad day. I'll choose a happy one. I'll choose the day I first 
knew that I loved George. Why should that be painful? 

Stage Manager 

You not only live it but you watch yourself living it. 

Emily 

Yes? 

Stage Manager 

And as you watch it, you see the thing that they, down there, never know. You 
see the future. You know what's going to happen afterwards. 

But is that…painful? Why? 

That's not the only reason why you shouldn't do it, Emily. When you've been 
here longer you'll see that our life here is to forget all that and think only of 
what's ahead and be ready for what's ahead. When you've been here longer 
you'll understand. 

Emily. 

But, Mother Gibbs, how can I ever forget that life? It's all I know. It's all I had. 

Mrs. Soames 

Oh, Emily. It isn't wise. Really, it isn't. 

Emily 

But it's a thing I must know for myself. I'll choose a happy day, anyway. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

No! At least, choose an unimportant day. Choose the least important day in 
your life. It will be important enough. 

Emily 

Then it can't be since I was married or since the baby was born.                                 
I can choose a birthday at least, can't I? I choose my twelfth birthday. 

Stage Manager 

All right. February 11th, 1899. A Tuesday. Do you want any special time of 
day? 

Emily 

Oh, I want the whole day. 

Stage Manager 

We'll begin at dawn.  

There's Main Street...why, that's Mr. Morgan's drugstore before he changed it! 
And there's the livery stable. 

Stage Manager 

Yes, it's 1899. This is fourteen years ago. 

Emily 

Oh, that's the town I knew as a little girl. And, look, there's the old white fence 
that used to be around our house. Oh, I'd forgotten that! Oh, I love it so!        
Are they inside? 

Stage Manager 

Yes, your mother'll be coming downstairs in a minute to make breakfast. 

Emily 

Will she? 

Stage Manager 

And you remember…your father had been away for several days. He came back 
on the early morning train. 

Emily 

No. 

Stage Manager 

He'd been back to his college to make a speech…in western New York, at 
Clinton. 

Emily 

Look! There's Howie Newsome. There's our policeman. But he's dead; he died. 

The voices of Howie Newsome, Constable Warren and Joe Crowell, Jr., are 

heard off-stage, 

Howie Newsome (Off stage) 

 Whoa Bessie! 'Morning, Bill. 

Morning, Howie. 

Howie Newsome (Off Stage) 

 You're up early. 

Constable Warren (Off Stage) 

Been rescuin' a party; darn near froze to death, down by Polish Town  

Emily 

Why, there's Joe Crowell. . . 

Joe Crowell (Off Stage) 

Good morning, Mr. Warren. 'Morning, Howie. 

Mrs. Webb enters.  

Mrs. Webb 

Children! Wally! Emily! Time to get up. 

Emily 

Mama, I'm here! Oh! how young Mama looks! I didn't know Mama was ever 
that young. 

Mrs. Webb 

You can come and dress by the kitchen fire, if you like. But hurry. 

Howie Newsome enters . 

Mrs. Webb (Continued) 

Good morning, Mr. Newsome. Whhhh..it's cold. 

Howie Newsome 

Ten below by my barn, Mrs. Webb. 

Think of it! Keep yourself wrapped up. 

Mama, I can't find my blue hair ribbon anywhere. 

Just open your eyes, dear, that's all. I laid it out for you special— on the 
dresser, there. If it were a snake it would bite you. 

Emily 

Yes, yes. 

Mr. Webb and Constable Warren enter. 

Mr. Webb 

Good morning, Bill. 

Constable Warren 

Good morning, Mr. Webb. You're up early. 

Mr. Webb 

Yes, just been back to my old college in New York State. Been any trouble here? 

Constable Warren 

Well, I was called up this mornin' to rescue a Polish fella. Darn near froze to 
death he was. 

Mr. Webb 

We must get it in the paper. 

Constable Warren exits. 

Emily                                                                                 

(Whispers.) 

Papa. 

Good morning, Mother. 

Mrs. Webb 

How did it go, Charles? 

Mr. Webb 

Oh, fine, I guess. I told'm a few things. Everything all right here? 

Mrs. Webb 

Yes…can't think of anything that's happened, special. Been right cold.  

Mr. Webb 

Yes, well, it's colder than that at Hamilton College. Students' ears are falling 
off. Paper have any mistakes in it? 

Mrs. Webb 

None that I noticed. Charles! Don't forget; it's Emily's birthday. Did you 
remember to get her something? 

Mr. Webb 

Yes, I've got something here.  

Mr. Webb calls upstairs as he exits. 

Where's my girl? Where's my birthday girl? 

Mrs. Webb 

Don't interrupt her now, Charles. You can see her at breakfast. She's slow 
enough as it is. Hurry up, children! It's seven o'clock. Now, I don't want to call 
you again. 

Emily 

I can't bear it. They're so young and beautiful. Why did they ever have to get 
old?  

Mama, I'm here. I'm grown up. I love you all. Everything. I can't look at 
everything hard enough. Good morning, Mama. 

Well, now, dear, a very happy birthday to my girl and many happy returns. 
There are some surprises waiting for you on the kitchen table. 

Emily 

Oh, Mama, you shouldn't have. 

Emily looks at the Stage Manager 

Emily (Continued) 

I can't. I can't. 

Mrs. Webb 

But birthday or no birthday, I want you to eat your breakfast good and slow. I 
want you to grow up and be a good strong girl. 

That in the blue paper is from your Aunt Carrie; and I reckon you can guess 
who brought the post-card album. I found it on the doorstep when I brought in 
the milk…George Gibbs…must have come over in the cold pretty early…right 
nice of him. 

Emily                                                                                 

Oh, George! I'd forgotten that… 

Mrs. Webb 

Chew that bacon good and slow. It'll help keep you warm on a cold day. 

Emily 

Oh, Mama, just look at me one minute as though you really saw me. Mama, 
fourteen years have gone by. I'm dead. You're a grandmother, Mama. I married 
George Gibbs, Mama. Wally's dead, too. Mama, his appendix burst on a 
camping trip to North Conway. We felt just terrible about it—don't you 
remember? But, just for a moment now we're all together. Mama, just for a 
moment we're happy. Let's look at one another. 

Mrs. Webb 

That in the yellow paper is something I found in the attic among your 
grandmother's things. You're old enough to wear it now, and I thought you'd 
like it. 

And this is from you. Why, Mama, it's just lovely and it's just what I wanted. 
It's beautiful! 

Emily flings her arms around her mother's neck. 

Mrs. Webb 

Well, I hoped you'd like it. Hunted all over. Your Aunt Norah couldn't find one 
in Concord, so I had to send all the way to Boston. Wally has something for 
you, too. He made it at manual-training class and he's very proud of it. Be sure 
you make a big fuss about it Your father has a surprise for you, too; don't 
know what it is myself. Shh…here he comes. 

Mr. Webb (off-stage) 

Where's my girl? Where's my birthday girl? 

Emily 

I can't. I can't go on. It goes so fast. We don't have time to look at one another. 

Emily breaks down sobbing.                                                               

Mrs. Webb exits. 

I didn't realize. So all that was going on and we never noticed. Take me 
back…up the hill…to my grave. But first: Wait! One more look. 

Looks left and then out past audience and then to the right. 

Good-by, Good-by, world. Good-by, Grover's Corners...Mama and Papa. Good-
by to clocks ticking…and Mama's sunflowers. And food and coffee. And new-
ironed dresses and hot baths…and sleeping and waking up. Oh, earth, you're 
too wonderful for anybody to realize you. 

To the Stage Manager 

Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it...every, every minute? 

Stage Manager 

No.  

Pause 

The saints and poets, maybe—they do some. 

I'm ready to go back. 

Emily returns to her chair beside Mrs. Gibbs. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Were you happy? 

Emily 

No. I should have listened to you. That's all human beings are! Just blind 
people. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Look, it's clearing up. The stars are coming out. 

Emily 

Oh, Mr. Stimson, I should have listened to them. 

Simon Stimson 

Yes, now you know. Now you know! That's what it was to be alive. To move 
about in a cloud of ignorance; to go up and down trampling on the feelings of 
those…of those about you. To spend and waste time as though you had a 
million years. To be always at the mercy of one self-centered passion, or 
another. Now you know. That's the happy existence you wanted to go back to. 
Ignorance and blindness. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Simon Stimson, that ain't the whole truth and you know it. Emily, look at that 
star. I forget its name. 

Emily                                                                            

Looking toward the back of church. 

Mother Gibbs, it's George. 

Mrs. Gibbs 

Shh, dear. Just rest yourself. 

It's George. 

George comes toward them and sinks to his knees                                              

then falls full length at Emily's feet. 

Simon Stimson 

That ain't no way to behave! 

Mrs. Soames 

He ought to be home. 

Emily 

Mother Gibbs? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

 Yes, Emily? 

Emily 

They don't understand, do they? 

Mrs. Gibbs 

No, dear. They don't understand. 

Stage Manager 

Most everybody's asleep in Grover's Corners. There are a few lights on. Shorty 
Hawkins, down at the depot, has just watched the Albany train go by. And at 
the livery stable somebody's setting up late and talking. Yes, it's clearing up. 
There are the stars doing their old, old crisscross journeys in the sky. Scholars 
haven't settled the matter yet, but they seem to think there are no living beings 
up there. Just chalk…or fire. Only this one is straining away, straining away all 
the time to make something of itself. The strain's so bad that every sixteen 
hours everybody lies down and gets a rest. 

 Hm…Eleven o'clock in Grover's Corners…You get a good rest, too. Good night.
