Michael Witmore

Director, Folger Shakespeare Library

It is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their
composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems
have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to
make them their own.

Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process
of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings
in language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,
new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a
mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds.
These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource
for study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic
texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The
Folger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a
trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.

The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis
for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their
origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the
single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An
unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and
artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been
consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions
also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of
Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.

I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul
Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s
works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a
richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers
who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow
the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the
Folger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and
digital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I
commend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.

From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare

Library

Until now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly
Folger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of
Shakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the
Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of
the plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that
there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But
Shakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or
plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some
cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published
versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great
collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First
Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of
Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others.
Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then
amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other
versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate
text.

Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an
unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the
period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that
made it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred
years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on
cultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,
for example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda
to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The
Tempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not
take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare
editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her
father, Prospero.

The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long
before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to
make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The
Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger
Shakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly
transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,
which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger
Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial
interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from
Othello: “ If she in chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square
brackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood  and sword and
fire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from

Textual Introduction

By Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine

Hamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier.  Who hath relieved/you?”). At
any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for
more information.

Because the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with
twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger
here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,
and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the
plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study
and enjoyment of Shakespeare.

The Taming of the Shrew begins with an “induction” in which a
nobleman plays a trick on a beggar, Christopher Sly, treating Sly as
if he is a nobleman who has lost his memory. A play is staged for
Sly—the play that we know as The Taming of the Shrew.

In the play, set in Padua, Lucentio and other suitors pursue Bianca,
but are told by her father, Baptista, that her bad-tempered older
sister, Katherine, must marry first. They encourage Petruchio, who
has come to Padua to find a wealthy wife, to court Katherine and
free Bianca to marry.

Petruchio negotiates marriage terms with Baptista, then has a stormy
meeting with Katherine, after which he assures Baptista that the two
have agreed to marry. Petruchio arrives late to their wedding dressed
in strange clothes; he behaves rudely and carries Katherine away
before the wedding dinner. At his home, he embarks on a plan to
“tame” Katherine as one would tame a wild hawk. Starved and kept
without sleep, Katherine eventually agrees with everything Petruchio
says, however absurd. He takes her back to Padua, where they attend
Bianca’s wedding. There Katherine proves more obedient to her
husband than the other wives, whom she chastises before she and
Petruchio go off to consummate their marriage.

 And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
 Balm his foul head in warm distillèd waters,
 And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;
 Procure me music ready when he wakes
 To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound.
 And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
 And, with a low, submissive reverence,
 Say “What is it your Honor will command?”
 Let one attend him with a silver basin
 Full of rosewater and bestrewed with flowers,
 Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
 And say “Will ’t please your Lordship cool your

 hands?”

 Someone be ready with a costly suit,
 And ask him what apparel he will wear.
 Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
 And that his lady mourns at his disease.
 Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,
 And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
 For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
 This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs.
 It will be pastime passing excellent
 If it be husbanded with modesty.

 Sirrah, go see what trumpet ’tis that sounds.

 And see him dressed in all suits like a lady.
 That done, conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber,
 And call him “Madam,” do him obeisance.
 Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
 He bear himself with honorable action,
 Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
 Unto their lords, by them accomplishèd.
 Such duty to the drunkard let him do
 With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
 And say “What is ’t your Honor will command,
 Wherein your lady and your humble wife
 May show her duty and make known her love?”
 And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
 And with declining head into his bosom,
 Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed
 To see her noble lord restored to health,
 Who, for this seven years, hath esteemed him
 No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
 And if the boy have not a woman’s gift
 To rain a shower of commanded tears,
 An onion will do well for such a shift,
 Which (in a napkin being close conveyed)
 Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
 See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst.

 And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.

  Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.

  A husband? A devil!

  I say “a husband.”

  I say “a devil.” Think’st thou, Hortensio,

 though her father be very rich, any man is so very a
 fool to be married to hell?

  Tush, Gremio. Though it pass your patience

 and mine to endure her loud alarums, why,
 man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man
 could light on them, would take her with all faults,
 and money enough.

  I cannot tell. But I had as lief take her dowry

 rotten apples. But come, since this bar in law
 makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly
 maintained till by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter

 You use your manners discreetly in all kind of

 But in all places else, your  master Lucentio.

  Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges in

 Latin. If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave
 his service—look you, sir: he bid me knock him
 and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit for a
 servant to use his master so, being perhaps, for
 aught I see, two-and-thirty, a pip out?

 Whom, would to God, I had well knocked at first,
 Then had not Grumio come by the worst.

 To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
 Where small experience grows. But in a few,
 Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
 Antonio, my father, is deceased,
 And I have thrust myself into this maze,
 Happily to wive and thrive, as best I may.
 Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
 And so am come abroad to see the world.

  Nay, look you, sir, he tells you

 flatly what his mind is. Why, give him gold enough
 and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an
 old trot with ne’er a tooth in her head, though she

 nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.

 I will continue that I broached in jest.
 I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
 With wealth enough, and young and beauteous,
 Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.
 Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
 Is that she is intolerable curst,
 And shrewd, and froward, so beyond all measure
 That, were my state far worser than it is,
 I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

, to Hortensio
  I pray you, sir, let him go while

 the humor lasts. O’ my word, an she knew him as
 well as I do, she would think scolding would do little
 good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a

 once, he’ll rail in his rope tricks. I’ll tell you what,
 sir, an she stand him but a little, he will throw a
 figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that
 she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.

 Softly, my masters. If you be gentlemen,
 Do me this right: hear me with patience.
 Baptista is a noble gentleman
 To whom my father is not all unknown,
 And were his daughter fairer than she is,
 She may more suitors have, and me for one.
 Fair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers.
 Then well one more may fair Bianca have.
 And so she shall. Lucentio shall make one,
 Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

 The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
 Her father keeps from all access of suitors
 And will not promise her to any man
 Until the elder sister first be wed.
 The younger then is free, and not before.

 Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest,
 And if you break the ice and do this feat,

 Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

 And through the instrument my pate made way,
 And there I stood amazèd for a while,
 As on a pillory, looking through the lute,
 While she did call me “rascal fiddler,”
 And “twangling Jack,” with twenty such vile terms,

  Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and

 an old jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned,
 a pair of boots that have been candle-cases, one
 buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword ta’en
 out of the town armory, with a broken hilt, and
 chapeless; with two broken points; his horse
 hipped, with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no
 kindred, besides possessed with the glanders and
 like to mose in the chine, troubled with the lampass,
 infected with the fashions, full of windgalls,
 sped with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure
 of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn
 with the bots, swayed  in the back and shoulder-shotten,
 near-legged before, and with a half-checked
 bit and a headstall of sheep’s leather,
 which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling,
 hath been often burst, and now repaired with
 knots; one girth six times pieced, and a woman’s
 crupper of velour, which hath two letters for her
 name fairly set down in studs, and here and there
 pieced with packthread.

 foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress—

  Both of one horse?
  What’s that to thee?
  Why, a horse.
  Tell thou the tale! But hadst thou not crossed

 me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell,
 and she under her horse; thou shouldst have heard
 in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he
 left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me
 because her horse stumbled, how she waded
 through the dirt to pluck him off me, how he swore,
 how she prayed that never prayed before, how I
 cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was
 burst, how I lost my crupper, with many things of
 worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion,
 and thou return unexperienced to thy grave.

  By this reck’ning, he is more shrew than she.
  Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all

 shall find when he comes home. But what talk I of
 this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Phillip,
 Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest. Let their heads
 be slickly combed, their blue coats brushed, and
 their garters of an indifferent knit. Let them curtsy
 with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair
 of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands.
 Are they all ready?

  They are.
  Call them forth.

 well beloved in Padua.—Do you hear, sir? To leave
 frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell Signior
 Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa and is
 here at the door to speak with him.

, as Vincentio
  Thou liest. His father is

 come from Padua and here looking out at the
 window.

  Art thou his father?
, as Vincentio
  Ay, sir, so his mother says,

 if I may believe her.

, to Vincentio
  Why, how now, gentleman!

 Why, this is flat knavery, to take upon you another
 man’s name.

, as Vincentio
  Lay hands on the villain. I

 believe he means to cosen somebody in this city
 under my countenance.

Enter Biondello.

, aside
  I have seen them in the church

 together. God send ’em good shipping! But who is
 here? Mine old master Vincentio! Now we are
 undone and brought to nothing.

 for I never saw you before in all my life.

  What, you notorious villain, didst thou

 never see thy master’s  father, Vincentio?

 marry, sir. See where he looks out of the window.

  Is ’t so indeed? 
  Help, help, help! Here’s a madman will

 murder me.

 immortal gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet, a
 velvet hose, a scarlet cloak, and a copatain hat! O, I
 am undone, I am undone! While I play the good
 husband at home, my son and my servant spend all
 at the university.

, as Lucentio
  How now, what’s the matter?

  What, is the man lunatic?

, as Lucentio
  Sir, you seem a sober ancient

 gentleman by your habit, but your words show you
 a madman. Why, sir, what ’cerns it you if I wear
 pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able
 to maintain it.

  His name? As if I knew not his name! I have

 brought him up ever since he was three years old,
 and his name is Tranio.

, as Vincentio
  Away, away, mad ass! His

 name is Lucentio and he is mine only son, and heir
 to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.

  Lucentio? O, he hath murdered his master!

 Lay hold on him, I charge you in the Duke’s name.
 O, my son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is
 my son Lucentio?

, as Lucentio
  Call forth an officer.

Enter an Officer.

 Carry this mad knave to the jail.—Father Baptista, I
 charge you see that he be forthcoming.

  Carry me to the jail?

  Stay, officer. He shall not go to prison.

  Talk not, Signior Gremio. I say he shall go to

 prison.

  Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched

 in this business. I dare swear this is the
 right Vincentio.

, as Vincentio
  Swear, if thou dar’st.

  Nay, I dare not swear it.

, as Lucentio
  Then thou wert best say that I

 am not Lucentio.

  Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.

 When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.

 Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
 But that our soft conditions and our hearts
 Should well agree with our external parts?
 Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
 My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
 My heart as great, my reason haply more,
 To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
 But now I see our lances are but straws,
 Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
 That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
 Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
 And place your hands below your husband’s foot;
 In token of which duty, if he please,
 My hand is ready, may it do him ease.

  Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.

 We three are married, but you two are sped.

 And being a winner, God give you good night.
