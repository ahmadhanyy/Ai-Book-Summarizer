Introduction

Special Introduction
By
Hon. John T. Morgan

In the eleven years that separated the Declaration of the In-
dependence of the United States from the completion of that
act in the ordination of our written Constitution, the great
minds of America were bent upon the study of the prin-

ciples of government that were essential to the preservation
of the liberties which had been won at great cost and with
heroic labors and sacrifices. Their studies were conducted in
view of the imperfections that experience had developed in
the government of the Confederation, and they were, there-
fore, practical and thorough.
When the Constitution was thus perfected and established,
a new form of government was created, but it was neither
speculative nor experimental as to the principles on which it

regulated by law,” with such results in the development of
strength, in population, wealth, and military and commer-
cial power, as no age had ever witnessed.
De Tocqueville had a special inquiry to prosecute, in his
visit to America, in which his generous and faithful soul and
the powers of his great intellect were engaged in the patriotic
effort to secure to the people of France the blessings that
Democracy in America had ordained and established
throughout nearly the entire Western Hemisphere. He had
read the story of the FrenchRevolution, much of which had
been recently written in the blood of men and women of
great distinction who were his progenitors; and had witnessed
the agitations and terrors of the Restoration and of the Sec-
ond Republic, fruitful in crime and sacrifice, and barren of
any good to mankind.
He had just witnessed the spread of republican govern-
ment through all the vast continental possessions of Spain in
America, and the loss of her great colonies. He had seen that
these revolutions were accomplished almost without the shed-
ding of blood, and he was filled with anxiety to learn the
causes that had placed republican government, in France, in

monarchical rule, while time shall last.
A French aristocrat of the purest strain of blood and of the
most honorable lineage, whose family influence was coveted
by crowned heads; who had no quarrel with the rulers of the
nation, and was secure against want by his inherited estates;
was moved by the agitations that compelled France to at-
tempt to grasp suddenly the liberties and happiness we had
gained in our revolution and, by his devout love of France,
to search out and subject to the test of reason the basic prin-
ciples of free government that had been embodied in our
Constitution. This was the mission of De Tocqueville, and
no mission was ever more honorably or justly conducted, or
concluded with greater eclat, or better results for the welfare
of mankind.
His researches were logical and exhaustive. They included
every phase of every question that then seemed to be appo-
site to the great inquiry he was making.
The judgment of all who have studied his commentaries
seems to have been unanimous, that his talents and learning
were fully equal to his task. He began with the physical ge-
ography of this country, and examined the characteristics of

the people, of all races and conditions, their social and reli-
gious sentiments, their education and tastes; their industries,
their commerce, their local governments, their passions and
prejudices, and their ethics and literature; leaving nothing
unnoticed that might afford an argument to prove that our
plan and form of government was or was not adapted espe-
cially to a peculiar people, or that it would be impracticable
in any different country, or among any different people.
The pride and comfort that the American people enjoy in
the great commentaries of De Tocqueville are far removed
from the selfish adulation that comes from a great and sin-
gular success. It is the consciousness of victory over a false
theory of government which has afflicted mankind for many
ages, that gives joy to the true American, as it did to De
Tocqueville in his great triumph.
When De Tocqueville wrote, we had lived less than fifty
years under our Constitution. In that time no great national
commotion had occurred that tested its strength, or its power
of resistance to internal strife, such as had converted his be-
loved France into fields of slaughter torn by tempests of wrath.
He had a strong conviction that no government could be

the face of any difficulties, and would have rejoiced to find
in the Constitution of the United States the remedy that is
provided for the healing of the nation.
De Tocqueville examined, with the care that is worthy the
importance of the subject, the nature and value of the sys-
tem of “local self-government,” as we style this most impor-
tant feature of our plan, and (as has often happened) when
this or any subject has become a matter of anxious concern,
his treatment of the questions is found to have been mas-
terly and his preconceptions almost prophetic.
We are frequently indebted to him for able expositions
and true doctrines relating to subjects that have slumbered
in the minds of the people until they were suddenly forced
on our attention by unexpected events.
In his introductory chapter, M. De Tocqueville says:
“Amongst the novel objects that attracted my attention dur-
ing my stay in the United States, nothing struck me more
forcibly than the general equality of conditions.” He referred,
doubtless, to social and political conditions among the people
of the white race, who are described as “We, the people,” in
the opening sentence of the Constitution. The last three

from the original plan and purpose of American Democ-
racy. “Local Self-Government,” independent of general con-
trol, except for general purposes, is the root and origin of all
free republican government, and is the antagonist of all great
political combinations that threaten the rights of minorities.
It is the public opinion formed in the independent expres-
sions of towns and other small civil districts that is the real
conservatism of free government. It is equally the enemy of
that dangerous evil, the corruption of the ballot-box, from
which it is now apprehended that one of our greatest troubles
is to arise.
The voter is selected, under our laws, because he has certain
physical qualifications – age and sex. His disqualifications,
when any are imposed, relate to his education or property,
and to the fact that he has not been convicted of crime. Of all
men he should be most directly amenable to public opinion.
The test of moral character and devotion to the duties of
good citizenship are ignored in the laws, because the courts
can seldom deal with such questions in a uniform and satis-
factory way, under rules that apply alike to all. Thus the voter,
selected by law to represent himself and four other non-vot-

for the safety of personal rights, and for the safety of the
government, and the prophetic outlook of M. De Tocqueville
will be fully realized through the influence of Democracy in
America. Each succeeding generation of Americans will find
in the pure and impartial reflections of De Tocqueville a new
source of pride in our institutions of government, and sound
reasons for patriotic effort to preserve them and to inculcate
their teachings. They have mastered the power of monarchi-
cal rule in the American Hemisphere, freeing religion from
all shackles, and will spread, by a quiet but resistless influ-
ence, through the islands of the seas to other lands, where
the appeals of De Tocqueville for human rights and liberties
have already inspired the souls of the people.

Special Introduction

Hon. John J. Ingalls

Nearly two-thirds of a century has elapsed since the appear-
ance of “Democracy in America,” by Alexis Charles Henri
Clerel de Tocqueville, a French nobleman, born at Paris, July
29, 1805.
Bred to the law, he exhibited an early predilection for phi-
losophy and political economy, and at twenty-two was ap-
pointed judge-auditor at the tribunal of Versailles.
In 1831, commissioned ostensibly to investigate the peni-
tentiary system of the United States, he visited this country,
with his friend, Gustave de Beaumont, travelling extensively
through those parts of the Republic then subdued to settle-
ment, studying the methods of local, State, and national ad-
ministration, and observing the manners and habits, the daily
life, the business, the industries and occupations of the people.
“Democracy in America,” the first of four volumes upon
“American Institutions and their Influence,” was published
in 1835. It was received at once by the scholars and thinkers

of Europe as a profound, impartial, and entertaining exposi-
tion of the principles of popular, representative self-govern-
ment.
Napoleon, “The mighty somnambulist of a vanished
dream,” had abolished feudalism and absolutism, made
monarchs and dynasties obsolete, and substituted for the
divine right of kings the sovereignty of the people.
Although by birth and sympathies an aristocrat, M. de
Tocqueville saw that the reign of tradition and privilege at
last was ended. He perceived that civilization, after many
bloody centuries, had entered a new epoch. He beheld, and
deplored, the excesses that had attended the genesis of the
democratic spirit in France, and while he loved liberty, he
detested the crimes that had been committed in its name.
Belonging neither to the class which regarded the social revo-
lution as an innovation to be resisted, nor to that which con-
sidered political equality the universal panacea for the evils
of humanity, he resolved by personal observation of the re-
sults of democracy in the New World to ascertain its natural
consequences, and to learn what the nations of Europe had
to hope or fear from its final supremacy.

That a youth of twenty-six should entertain a design so
broad and bold implies singular intellectual intrepidity. He
had neither model nor precedent. The vastness and novelty
of the undertaking increase admiration for the remarkable
ability with which the task was performed.
Were literary excellence the sole claim of “Democracy in
America” to distinction, the splendor of its composition alone
would entitle it to high place among the masterpieces of the
century. The first chapter, upon the exterior form of North
America, as the theatre upon which the great drama is to be
enacted, for graphic and picturesque description of the physi-
cal characteristics of the continent is not surpassed in litera-
ture: nor is there any subdivision of the work in which the
severest philosophy is not invested with the grace of poetry,
and the driest statistics with the charm of romance. Western
emigration seemed commonplace and prosaic till M. de
Tocqueville said, “This gradual and continuous progress of
the European race toward the Rocky Mountains has the so-
lemnity of a providential event; it is like a deluge of men
rising unabatedly, and daily driven onward by the hand of
God!”

sence of intellectual freedom which seemed to him to de-
grade administration and bring statesmanship, learning, and
literature to the level of the lowest, are no longer considered.
The violence of party spirit has been mitigated, and the judg-
ment of the wise is not subordinated to the prejudices of the
ignorant.
Other dangers have come. Equality of conditions no longer
exists. Prophets of evil predict the downfall of democracy,
but the student of M. de Tocqueville will find consolation
and encouragement in the reflection that the same spirit
which has vanquished the perils of the past, which he fore-
saw, will be equally prepared for the responsibilities of the
present and the future.
The last of the four volumes of M. de Tocqueville’s work
upon American institutions appeared in 1840.
In 1838 he was chosen member of the Academy of Moral
and Political Sciences. In 1839 he was elected to the Cham-
ber of Deputies. He became a member of the French Acad-
emy in 1841. In 1848 he was in the Assembly, and from
June 2nd to October 31st he was Minister of Foreign Af-
fairs. The coup d’etat of December 2, 1851 drove him from

the public service. In 1856 he published “The Old Regime
and the Revolution.” He died at Cannes, April 15, 1859, at
the age of fifty-four.

Introductory Chapter

Amongst the novel objects that attracted my attention dur-
ing my stay in the United States, nothing struck me more
forcibly than the general equality of conditions. I readily dis-
covered the prodigious influence which this primary fact
exercises on the whole course of society, by giving a certain
direction to public opinion, and a certain tenor to the laws;
by imparting new maxims to the governing powers, and pe-
culiar habits to the governed. I speedily perceived that the
influence of this fact extends far beyond the political charac-
ter and the laws of the country, and that it has no less empire
over civil society than over the Government; it creates opin-
ions, engenders sentiments, suggests the ordinary practices
of life, and modifies whatever it does not produce. The more
I advanced in the study of American society, the more I per-
ceived that the equality of conditions is the fundamental fact
from which all others seem to be derived, and the central
point at which all my observations constantly terminated.
I then turned my thoughts to our own hemisphere, where
I imagined that I discerned something analogous to the spec-

XI and Louis XIV reduced every rank beneath the throne to
the same subjection; Louis XV descended, himself and all
his Court, into the dust.
As soon as land was held on any other than a feudal ten-
ure, and personal property began in its turn to confer influ-
ence and power, every improvement which was introduced
in commerce or manufacture was a fresh element of the equal-
ity of conditions. Henceforward every new discovery, every
new want which it engendered, and every new desire which
craved satisfaction, was a step towards the universal level.
The taste for luxury, the love of war, the sway of fashion, and
the most superficial as well as the deepest passions of the
human heart, co-operated to enrich the poor and to impov-
erish the rich.
From the time when the exercise of the intellect became
the source of strength and of wealth, it is impossible not to
consider every addition to science, every fresh truth, and every
new idea as a germ of power placed within the reach of the
people. Poetry, eloquence, and memory, the grace of wit, the
glow of imagination, the depth of thought, and all the gifts
which are bestowed by Providence with an equal hand, turned

examine what has happened in France at intervals of fifty
years, beginning with the eleventh century, we shall invari-
ably perceive that a twofold revolution has taken place in the
state of society. The noble has gone down on the social lad-
der, and the roturier has gone up; the one descends as the
other rises. Every half century brings them nearer to each
other, and they will very shortly meet.
Nor is this phenomenon at all peculiar to France.
Whithersoever we turn our eyes we shall witness the same
continual revolution throughout the whole of Christendom.
The various occurrences of national existence have every-
where turned to the advantage of democracy; all men have
aided it by their exertions: those who have intentionally la-
bored in its cause, and those who have served it unwittingly;
those who have fought for it and those who have declared
themselves its opponents, have all been driven along in the
same track, have all labored to one end, some ignorantly and
some unwillingly; all have been blind instruments in the
hands of God.
The gradual development of the equality of conditions is
therefore a providential fact, and it possesses all the charac-

as the serf looked upon his own inferiority as a consequence
of the immutable order of nature, it is easy to imagine that a
mutual exchange of good-will took place between two classes
so differently gifted by fate. Inequality and wretchedness were
then to be found in society; but the souls of neither rank of
men were degraded. Men are not corrupted by the exercise
of power or debased by the habit of obedience, but by the
exercise of a power which they believe to be illegal and by
obedience to a rule which they consider to be usurped and
oppressive. On one side was wealth, strength, and leisure,
accompanied by the refinements of luxury, the elegance of
taste, the pleasures of wit, and the religion of art. On the
other was labor and a rude ignorance; but in the midst of
this coarse and ignorant multitude it was not uncommon to
meet with energetic passions, generous sentiments, profound
religious convictions, and independent virtues. The body of
a State thus organized might boast of its stability, its power,
and, above all, of its glory.
But the scene is now changed, and gradually the two ranks
mingle; the divisions which once severed mankind are low-
ered, property is divided, power is held in common, the light

may be regulated and directed forwards; if there be less splen-
dor than in the halls of an aristocracy, the contrast of misery
will be less frequent also; the pleasures of enjoyment may be
less excessive, but those of comfort will be more general; the
sciences may be less perfectly cultivated, but ignorance will
be less common; the impetuosity of the feelings will be re-
pressed, and the habits of the nation softened; there will be
more vices and fewer crimes. In the absence of enthusiasm
and of an ardent faith, great sacrifices may be obtained from
the members of a commonwealth by an appeal to their un-
derstandings and their experience; each individual will feel
the same necessity for uniting with his fellow-citizens to pro-
tect his own weakness; and as he knows that if they are to
assist he must co-operate, he will readily perceive that his
personal interest is identified with the interest of the com-
munity. The nation, taken as a whole, will be less brilliant,
less glorious, and perhaps less strong; but the majority of the
citizens will enjoy a greater degree of prosperity, and the
people will remain quiet, not because it despairs of amelio-
ration, but because it is conscious of the advantages of its
condition. If all the consequences of this state of things were

not good or useful, society would at least have appropriated
all such as were useful and good; and having once and for
ever renounced the social advantages of aristocracy, man-
kind would enter into possession of all the benefits which
democracy can afford.
But here it may be asked what we have adopted in the
place of those institutions, those ideas, and those customs of
our forefathers which we have abandoned. The spell of roy-
alty is broken, but it has not been succeeded by the majesty
of the laws; the people has learned to despise all authority,
but fear now extorts a larger tribute of obedience than that
which was formerly paid by reverence and by love.
I perceive that we have destroyed those independent be-
ings which were able to cope with tyranny single-handed;
but it is the Government that has inherited the privileges of
which families, corporations, and individuals have been de-
prived; the weakness of the whole community has therefore
succeeded that influence of a small body of citizens, which,
if it was sometimes oppressive, was often conservative. The
division of property has lessened the distance which sepa-
rated the rich from the poor; but it would seem that the

morality without faith; but they have seen religion in the
ranks of their adversaries, and they inquire no further; some
of them attack it openly, and the remainder are afraid to
defend it.
In former ages slavery has been advocated by the venal
and slavish-minded, whilst the independent and the warm-
hearted were struggling without hope to save the liberties of
mankind. But men of high and generous characters are now
to be met with, whose opinions are at variance with their
inclinations, and who praise that servility which they have
themselves never known. Others, on the contrary, speak in
the name of liberty, as if they were able to feel its sanctity
and its majesty, and loudly claim for humanity those rights
which they have always disowned. There are virtuous and
peaceful individuals whose pure morality, quiet habits, af-
fluence, and talents fit them to be the leaders of the sur-
rounding population; their love of their country is sincere,
and they are prepared to make the greatest sacrifices to its
welfare, but they confound the abuses of civilization with its
benefits, and the idea of evil is inseparable in their minds
from that of novelty.

Not far from this class is another party, whose object is to
materialize mankind, to hit upon what is expedient without
heeding what is just, to acquire knowledge without faith,
and prosperity apart from virtue; assuming the title of the
champions of modern civilization, and placing themselves
in a station which they usurp with insolence, and from which
they are driven by their own unworthiness. Where are we
then? The religionists are the enemies of liberty, and the
friends of liberty attack religion; the high- minded and the
noble advocate subjection, and the meanest and most servile
minds preach independence; honest and enlightened citi-
zens are opposed to all progress, whilst men without patrio-
tism and without principles are the apostles of civilization
and of intelligence. Has such been the fate of the centuries
which have preceded our own? and has man always inhab-
ited a world like the present, where nothing is linked to-
gether, where virtue is without genius, and genius without
honor; where the love of order is confounded with a taste for
oppression, and the holy rites of freedom with a contempt
of law; where the light thrown by conscience on human ac-
tions is dim, and where nothing seems to be any longer for-

revolution as a fact already accomplished or on the eve of its
accomplishment; and I have selected the nation, from
amongst those which have undergone it, in which its devel-
opment has been the most peaceful and the most complete,
in order to discern its natural consequences, and, if it be
possible, to distinguish the means by which it may be ren-
dered profitable. I confess that in America I saw more than
America; I sought the image of democracy itself, with its
inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in
order to learn what we have to fear or to hope from its
progress.
In the first part of this work I have attempted to show the
tendency given to the laws by the democracy of America,
which is abandoned almost without restraint to its instinc-
tive propensities, and to exhibit the course it prescribes to
the Government and the influence it exercises on affairs. I
have sought to discover the evils and the advantages which it
produces. I have examined the precautions used by the Ameri-
cans to direct it, as well as those which they have not adopted,
and I have undertaken to point out the causes which enable
it to govern society. I do not know whether I have succeeded

carefully noted every conversation of this nature as soon as it
occurred, but these notes will never leave my writing-case; I
had rather injure the success of my statements than add my
name to the list of those strangers who repay the generous
hospitality they have received by subsequent chagrin and
annoyance.
I am aware that, notwithstanding my care, nothing will be
easier than to criticise this book, if anyone ever chooses to
criticise it. Those readers who may examine it closely will
discover the fundamental idea which connects the several
parts together. But the diversity of the subjects I have had to
treat is exceedingly great, and it will not be difficult to op-
pose an isolated fact to the body of facts which I quote, or an
isolated idea to the body of ideas I put forth. I hope to be
read in the spirit which has guided my labors, and that my
book may be judged by the general impression it leaves, as I
have formed my own judgment not on any single reason,
but upon the mass of evidence. It must not be forgotten that
the author who wishes to be understood is obliged to push
all his ideas to their utmost theoretical consequences, and
often to the verge of what is false or impracticable; for if it be

necessary sometimes to quit the rules of logic in active life,
such is not the case in discourse, and a man finds that almost
as many difficulties spring from inconsistency of language as
usually arise from inconsistency of conduct.
I conclude by pointing out myself what many readers will
consider the principal defect of the work. This book is writ-
ten to favor no particular views, and in composing it I have
entertained no designs of serving or attacking any party; I
have undertaken not to see differently, but to look further
than parties, and whilst they are busied for the morrow I
have turned my thoughts to the Future.

Chapter I: Exterior Form Of North America

Chapter Summary

North America divided into two vast regions, one inclining
towards the Pole, the other towards the Equator – Valley of
the Mississippi – Traces of the Revolutions of the Globe –
Shore of the Atlantic Ocean where the English Colonies were
founded -Difference in the appearance of North and of South
America at the time of their Discovery – Forests of North
America – Prairies -Wandering Tribes of Natives – Their out-
ward appearance, manners, and language – Traces of an un-
known people.

Exterior Form Of North America

North America presents in its external form certain general
features which it is easy to discriminate at the first glance. A
sort of methodical order seems to have regulated the separa-
tion of land and water, mountains and valleys. A simple, but
grand, arrangement is discoverable amidst the confusion of

above the level of their waters; each of them thus forming a
vast bowl filled to the brim. The slightest change in the struc-
ture of the globe would cause their waters to rush either to-
wards the Pole or to the tropical sea.
The second region is more varied on its surface, and better
suited for the habitation of man. Two long chains of mountains
divide it from one extreme to the other; the Alleghany ridge
takes the form of the shores of the Atlantic Ocean; the other is
parallel with the Pacific. The space which lies between these
two chains of mountains contains 1,341,649 square miles.* Its
surface is therefore about six times as great as that of France.
This vast territory, however, forms a single valley, one side of
which descends gradually from the rounded summits of the
Alleghanies, while the other rises in an uninterrupted course
towards the tops of the Rocky Mountains. At the bottom of the
valley flows an immense river, into which the various streams
issuing from the mountains fall from all parts. In memory of
their native land, the French formerly called this river the St.
Louis. The Indians, in their pompous language, have named it
the Father of Waters, or the Mississippi.

The Mississippi takes its source above the limit of the two
great regions of which I have spoken, not far from the high-
est point of the table-land where they unite. Near the same
spot rises another river,* which empties itself into the Polar
seas. The course of the Mississippi is at first dubious: it winds
several times towards the north, from whence it rose; and at
length, after having been delayed in lakes and marshes, it
flows slowly onwards to the south. Sometimes quietly glid-
ing along the argillaceous bed which nature has assigned to
it, sometimes swollen by storms, the Mississippi waters 2,500
miles in its course.** At the distance of 1,364 miles from its
mouth this river attains an average depth of fifteen feet; and
it is navigated by vessels of 300 tons burden for a course of
nearly 500 miles. Fifty-seven large navigable rivers contrib-
ute to swell the waters of the Mississippi; amongst others,
the Missouri, which traverses a space of 2,500 miles; the Ar-
kansas of 1,300 miles, the Red River 1,000 miles, four whose
course is from 800 to 1,000 miles in length, viz., the Illinois,
the St. Peter’s, the St. Francis, and the Moingona; besides a
countless multitude of rivulets which unite from all parts

their tributary streams.
 The valley which is watered by the Mississippi seems
formed to be the bed of this mighty river, which, like a god
of antiquity, dispenses both good and evil in its course. On
the shores of the stream nature displays an inexhaustible fer-
tility; in proportion as you recede from its banks, the powers
of vegetation languish, the soil becomes poor, and the plants
that survive have a sickly growth. Nowhere have the great
convulsions of the globe left more evident traces than in the
valley of the Mississippi; the whole aspect of the country
shows the powerful effects of water, both by its fertility and
by its barrenness. The waters of the primeval ocean accumu-
lated enormous beds of vegetable mould in the valley, which
they levelled as they retired. Upon the right shore of the river
are seen immense plains, as smooth as if the husbandman
had passed over them with his roller. As you approach the
mountains the soil becomes more and more unequal and
sterile; the ground is, as it were, pierced in a thousand places
by primitive rocks, which appear like the bones of a skeleton
whose flesh is partly consumed. The surface of the earth is
covered with a granite sand and huge irregular masses of stone,

among which a few plants force their growth, and give the
appearance of a green field covered with the ruins of a vast
edifice. These stones and this sand discover, on examina-
tion, a perfect analogy with those which compose the arid
and broken summits of the Rocky Mountains. The flood of
waters which washed the soil to the bottom of the valley
afterwards carried away portions of the rocks themselves; and
these, dashed and bruised against the neighboring cliffs, were
left scattered like wrecks at their feet.* The valley of the Mis-
sissippi is, upon the whole, the most magnificent dwelling-
place prepared by God for man’s abode; and yet it may be
said that at present it is but a mighty desert.
On the eastern side of the Alleghanies, between the base
of these mountains and the Atlantic Ocean, there lies a long
ridge of rocks and sand, which the sea appears to have left
behind as it retired. The mean breadth of this territory does
not exceed one hundred miles; but it is about nine hundred
miles in length. This part of the American continent has a
soil which offers every obstacle to the husbandman, and its
vegetation is scanty and unvaried.
*See Appendix, A.

Upon this inhospitable coast the first united efforts of hu-
man industry were made. The tongue of arid land was the
cradle of those English colonies which were destined one
day to become the United States of America. The centre of
power still remains here; whilst in the backwoods the true
elements of the great people to whom the future control of
the continent belongs are gathering almost in secrecy together.
When the Europeans first landed on the shores of the West
Indies, and afterwards on the coast of South America, they
thought themselves transported into those fabulous regions
of which poets had sung. The sea sparkled with phosphoric
light, and the extraordinary transparency of its waters dis-
covered to the view of the navigator all that had hitherto
been hidden in the deep abyss.* Here and there appeared
little islands perfumed with odoriferous plants, and resem-
bling baskets of flowers floating on the tranquil surface of

the ocean. Every object which met the sight, in this enchant-
ing region, seemed prepared to satisfy the wants or contrib-
ute to the pleasures of man. Almost all the trees were loaded
with nourishing fruits, and those which were useless as food
delighted the eye by the brilliancy and variety of their colors.
In groves of fragrant lemon-trees, wild figs, flowering myrtles,
acacias, and oleanders, which were hung with festoons of
various climbing plants, covered with flowers, a multitude
of birds unknown in Europe displayed their bright plumage,
glittering with purple and azure, and mingled their warbling
with the harmony of a world teeming with life and motion.*
Underneath this brilliant exterior death was concealed. But
the air of these climates had so enervating an influence that
man, absorbed by present enjoyment, was rendered regard-
less of the future.
North America appeared under a very different aspect; there
everything was grave, serious, and solemn: it seemed created
to be the domain of intelligence, as the South was that of

wide tracts of sand. The foliage of its woods was dark and
gloomy, for they were composed of firs, larches, evergreen
oaks, wild olive-trees, and laurels. Beyond this outer belt lay
the thick shades of the central forest, where the largest trees
which are produced in the two hemispheres grow side by
side. The plane, the catalpa, the sugar- maple, and the Vir-
ginian poplar mingled their branches with those of the oak,
the beech, and the lime. In these, as in the forests of the Old
World, destruction was perpetually going on. The ruins of
vegetation were heaped upon each other; but there was no
laboring hand to remove them, and their decay was not rapid
enough to make room for the continual work of reproduc-
tion. Climbing plants, grasses, and other herbs forced their
way through the mass of dying trees; they crept along their
bending trunks, found nourishment in their dusty cavities,
and a passage beneath the lifeless bark. Thus decay gave its
assistance to life, and their respective productions were
mingled together. The depths of these forests were gloomy
and obscure, undirected in their course by human industry,
preserved in them a constant moisture. It was rare to meet
with flowers, wild fruits, or birds beneath their shades. The
fall of a tree overthrown by age, the rushing torrent of a cata-
ract, the lowing of the buffalo, and the howling of the wind
were the only sounds which broke the silence of nature.

To the east of the great river, the woods almost disappeared;
in their stead were seen prairies of immense extent. Whether
Nature in her infinite variety had denied the germs of trees
to these fertile plains, or whether they had once been cov-
ered with forests, subsequently destroyed by the hand of man,
is a question which neither tradition nor scientific research
has been able to resolve.
These immense deserts were not, however, devoid of hu-
man inhabitants. Some wandering tribes had been for ages
scattered among the forest shades or the green pastures of
the prairie. From the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the delta
of the Mississippi, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean,
these savages possessed certain points of resemblance which
bore witness of their common origin; but at the same time
they differed from all other known races of men:* they were

Strait, which allows of the supposition, that at a remote period
they gave inhabitants to the desert continent of America. But this

neither white like the Europeans, nor yellow like most of the
Asiatics, nor black like the negroes. Their skin was reddish
brown, their hair long and shining, their lips thin, and their
cheekbones very prominent. The languages spoken by the
North American tribes are various as far as regarded their
words, but they were subject to the same grammatical rules.
These rules differed in several points from such as had been
observed to govern the origin of language. The idiom of the
Americans seemed to be the product of new combinations,
and bespoke an effort of the understanding of which the
Indians of our days would be incapable.*

The social state of these tribes differed also in many re-
spects from all that was seen in the Old World. They seemed
to have multiplied freely in the midst of their deserts with-
out coming in contact with other races more civilized than
their own. Accordingly, they exhibited none of those indis-
tinct, incoherent notions of right and wrong, none of that
deep corruption of manners, which is usually joined with
ignorance and rudeness among nations which, after advanc-
ing to civilization, have relapsed into a state of barbarism.

*See Appendix, C.

This unfortunate effect of the disparity of conditions is
not observable in savage life: the Indians, although they are
ignorant and poor, are equal and free. At the period when
Europeans first came among them the natives of North
America were ignorant of the value of riches, and indifferent
to the enjoyments which civilized man procures to himself
by their means. Nevertheless there was nothing coarse in their
demeanor; they practised an habitual reserve and a kind of
aristocratic politeness. Mild and hospitable when at peace,
though merciless in war beyond any known degree of hu-
man ferocity, the Indian would expose himself to die of hun-
ger in order to succor the stranger who asked admittance by
night at the door of his hut; yet he could tear in pieces with
his hands the still quivering limbs of his prisoner. The fa-
mous republics of antiquity never gave examples of more
unshaken courage, more haughty spirits, or more intractable
love of independence than were hidden in former times
among the wild forests of the New World.* The Europeans

produced no great impression when they landed upon the
shores of North America; their presence engendered neither
envy nor fear. What influence could they possess over such
men as we have described? The Indian could live without
wants, suffer without complaint, and pour out his death-
song at the stake.* Like all the other members of the great
human family, these savages believed in the existence of a
better world, and adored under different names, God, the
creator of the universe. Their notions on the great intellec-
tual truths were in general simple and philosophical.**

Although we have here traced the character of a primitive
people, yet it cannot be doubted that another people, more
civilized and more advanced in all respects, had preceded it
in the same regions.
An obscure tradition which prevailed among the Indians
to the north of the Atlantic informs us that these very tribes

148, that among the Iroquois, when attacked by a superior force,
aged men refused to fly or to survive the destruction of their coun-
try; and they braved death like the ancient Romans when their
capital was sacked by the Gauls. Further on, p. 150, he tells us
that there is no example of an Indian who, having fallen into the
hands of his enemies, begged for his life; on the contrary, the cap-
tive sought to obtain death at the hands of his conquerors by the
use of insult and provocation.

Although the vast country which we have been describing
was inhabited by many indigenous tribes, it may justly be

and the early inhabitants of North America lived by the pro-
duce of the chase. Their implacable prejudices, their uncon-

Exterior Form Of North America

North America presents in its external form certain general
features which it is easy to discriminate at the first glance. A
sort of methodical order seems to have regulated the separa-
tion of land and water, mountains and valleys. A simple, but
grand, arrangement is discoverable amidst the confusion of

above the level of their waters; each of them thus forming a
vast bowl filled to the brim. The slightest change in the struc-
ture of the globe would cause their waters to rush either to-
wards the Pole or to the tropical sea.
The second region is more varied on its surface, and better
suited for the habitation of man. Two long chains of moun-
tains divide it from one extreme to the other; the Alleghany
ridge takes the form of the shores of the Atlantic Ocean; the
other is parallel with the Pacific. The space which lies between
these two chains of mountains contains 1,341,649 square miles.*
Its surface is therefore about six times as great as that of France.
This vast territory, however, forms a single valley, one side of
which descends gradually from the rounded summits of the
Alleghanies, while the other rises in an uninterrupted course
towards the tops of the Rocky Mountains. At the bottom of
the valley flows an immense river, into which the various
streams issuing from the mountains fall from all parts. In
memory of their native land, the French formerly called this
river the St. Louis. The Indians, in their pompous language,
have named it the Father of Waters, or the Mississippi.
*Darby’s “View of the United States.”

The Mississippi takes its source above the limit of the two
great regions of which I have spoken, not far from the highest
point of the table-land where they unite. Near the same spot
rises another river,* which empties itself into the Polar seas.
The course of the Mississippi is at first dubious: it winds sev-
eral times towards the north, from whence it rose; and at length,
after having been delayed in lakes and marshes, it flows slowly
onwards to the south. Sometimes quietly gliding along the
argillaceous bed which nature has assigned to it, sometimes
swollen by storms, the Mississippi waters 2,500 miles in its
course.** At the distance of 1,364 miles from its mouth this
river attains an average depth of fifteen feet; and it is navigated
by vessels of 300 tons burden for a course of nearly 500 miles.
Fifty-seven large navigable rivers contribute to swell the wa-
ters of the Mississippi; amongst others, the Missouri, which
traverses a space of 2,500 miles; the Arkansas of 1,300 miles,
the Red River 1,000 miles, four whose course is from 800 to
1,000 miles in length, viz., the Illinois, the St. Peter’s, the St.
Francis, and the Moingona; besides a countless multitude of
rivulets which unite from all parts their tributary streams.

appearance of a green field covered with the ruins of a vast
edifice. These stones and this sand discover, on examina-
tion, a perfect analogy with those which compose the arid
and broken summits of the Rocky Mountains. The flood of
waters which washed the soil to the bottom of the valley
afterwards carried away portions of the rocks themselves; and
these, dashed and bruised against the neighboring cliffs, were
left scattered like wrecks at their feet.* The valley of the Mis-
sissippi is, upon the whole, the most magnificent dwelling-
place prepared by God for man’s abode; and yet it may be
said that at present it is but a mighty desert.
On the eastern side of the Alleghanies, between the base
of these mountains and the Atlantic Ocean, there lies a long
ridge of rocks and sand, which the sea appears to have left
behind as it retired. The mean breadth of this territory does
not exceed one hundred miles; but it is about nine hundred
miles in length. This part of the American continent has a
soil which offers every obstacle to the husbandman, and its
vegetation is scanty and unvaried.
Upon this inhospitable coast the first united efforts of hu-

man industry were made. The tongue of arid land was the
cradle of those English colonies which were destined one
day to become the United States of America. The centre of
power still remains here; whilst in the backwoods the true
elements of the great people to whom the future control of
the continent belongs are gathering almost in secrecy together.
When the Europeans first landed on the shores of the West
Indies, and afterwards on the coast of South America, they
thought themselves transported into those fabulous regions
of which poets had sung. The sea sparkled with phosphoric
light, and the extraordinary transparency of its waters dis-
covered to the view of the navigator all that had hitherto
been hidden in the deep abyss.* Here and there appeared
little islands perfumed with odoriferous plants, and resem-
bling baskets of flowers floating on the tranquil surface of
the ocean. Every object which met the sight, in this enchant-
ing region, seemed prepared to satisfy the wants or contrib-

bean Sea is so transparent that corals and fish are discernible at a

ute to the pleasures of man. Almost all the trees were loaded
with nourishing fruits, and those which were useless as food
delighted the eye by the brilliancy and variety of their colors.
In groves of fragrant lemon-trees, wild figs, flowering myrtles,
acacias, and oleanders, which were hung with festoons of
various climbing plants, covered with flowers, a multitude
of birds unknown in Europe displayed their bright plumage,
glittering with purple and azure, and mingled their warbling
with the harmony of a world teeming with life and motion.*
Underneath this brilliant exterior death was concealed. But
the air of these climates had so enervating an influence that
man, absorbed by present enjoyment, was rendered regard-
less of the future.
North America appeared under a very different aspect; there
everything was grave, serious, and solemn: it seemed created
to be the domain of intelligence, as the South was that of
sensual delight. A turbulent and foggy ocean washed its
shores. It was girt round by a belt of granite rocks, or by
wide tracts of sand. The foliage of its woods was dark and
gloomy, for they were composed of firs, larches, evergreen

oaks, wild olive-trees, and laurels. Beyond this outer belt lay
the thick shades of the central forest, where the largest trees
which are produced in the two hemispheres grow side by
side. The plane, the catalpa, the sugar-maple, and the Vir-
ginian poplar mingled their branches with those of the oak,

Origin Of The Anglo-Americans,
And Its Importance In Relation To
Their Future Condition

After the birth of a human being his early years are obscurely
spent in the toils or pleasures of childhood. As he grows up
the world receives him, when his manhood begins, and he
enters into contact with his fellows. He is then studied for
the first time, and it is imagined that the germ of the vices
and the virtues of his maturer years is then formed. This, if I
am not mistaken, is a great error. We must begin higher up;
we must watch the infant in its mother’s arms; we must see
the first images which the external world casts upon the dark
mirror of his mind; the first occurrences which he witnesses;
we must hear the first words which awaken the sleeping pow-
ers of thought, and stand by his earliest efforts, if we would
understand the prejudices, the habits, and the passions which
will rule his life. The entire man is, so to speak, to be seen in
the cradle of the child.
The growth of nations presents something analogous to
this: they all bear some marks of their origin; and the cir-

rity of the past concealed from them. If we carefully examine
the social and political state of America, after having studied
its history, we shall remain perfectly convinced that not an
opinion, not a custom, not a law, I may even say not an
event, is upon record which the origin of that people will
not explain. The readers of this book will find the germ of all
that is to follow in the present chapter, and the key to almost
the whole work.
The emigrants who came, at different periods to occupy
the territory now covered by the American Union differed
from each other in many respects; their aim was not the same,
and they governed themselves on different principles. These
men had, however, certain features in common, and they
were all placed in an analogous situation. The tie of lan-
guage is perhaps the strongest and the most durable that can
unite mankind. All the emigrants spoke the same tongue;
they were all offsets from the same people. Born in a country
which had been agitated for centuries by the struggles of
faction, and in which all parties had been obliged in their
turn to place themselves under the protection of the laws,
their political education had been perfected in this rude

school, and they were more conversant with the notions of
right and the principles of true freedom than the greater part
of their European contemporaries. At the period of their first
emigrations the parish system, that fruitful germ of free in-
stitutions, was deeply rooted in the habits of the English;
and with it the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people had
been introduced into the bosom of the monarchy of the
House of Tudor.
The religious quarrels which have agitated the Christian
world were then rife. England had plunged into the new
order of things with headlong vehemence. The character of
its inhabitants, which had always been sedate and reflective,
became argumentative and austere. General information had
been increased by intellectual debate, and the mind had re-
ceived a deeper cultivation. Whilst religion was the topic of
discussion, the morals of the people were reformed. All these
national features are more or less discoverable in the physi-
ognomy of those adventurers who came to seek a new home
on the opposite shores of the Atlantic.
Another remark, to which we shall hereafter have occasion
to recur, is applicable not only to the English, but to the

French, the Spaniards, and all the Europeans who succes-
sively established themselves in the New World. All these
European colonies contained the elements, if not the devel-
opment, of a complete democracy. Two causes led to this
result. It may safely be advanced, that on leaving the mother-
country the emigrants had in general no notion of superior-
ity over one another. The happy and the powerful do not go
into exile, and there are no surer guarantees of equality among
men than poverty and misfortune. It happened, however, on
several occasions, that persons of rank were driven to America
by political and religious quarrels. Laws were made to estab-
lish a gradation of ranks; but it was soon found that the soil
of America was opposed to a territorial aristocracy. To bring
that refractory land into cultivation, the constant and inter-
ested exertions of the owner himself were necessary; and when
the ground was prepared, its produce was found to be insuf-
ficient to enrich a master and a farmer at the same time. The
land was then naturally broken up into small portions, which
the proprietor cultivated for himself. Land is the basis of an
aristocracy, which clings to the soil that supports it; for it is
not by privileges alone, nor by birth, but by landed property

has cost more lives in America, than the united influence of
war and bad laws. The men sent to Virginia * were seekers of
gold, adventurers, without resources and without character,
whose turbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant
colony, ** and rendered its progress uncertain. The artisans
and agriculturists arrived afterwards; and, although they were
a more moral and orderly race of men, they were in nowise
above the level of the inferior classes in England. *** No lofty
conceptions, no intellectual system, directed the foundation
of these new settlements. The colony was scarcely established
when slavery was introduced, **** and this was the main cir-
cumstance which has exercised so prodigious an influence on
the character, the laws, and all the future prospects of the South.
Slavery, as we shall afterwards show, dishonors labor; it intro-
duces idleness into society, and with idleness, ignorance and
pride, luxury and distress. It enervates the powers of the mind,
and benumbs the activity of man. The influence of slavery,
united to the English character, explains the manners and the
social condition of the Southern States.
*The charter granted by the Crown of England in 1609 stipu-
lated, amongst other conditions, that the adventurers should

pay to the Crown a fifth of the produce of all gold and silver
mines. See Marshall’s “Life of Washington,” vol. i. pp. 18-66.
**A large portion of the adventurers, says Stith (“History of
Virginia”), were unprincipled young men of family, whom
their parents were glad to ship off, discharged servants,
fraudulent bankrupts, or debauchees; and others of the same
class, people more apt to pillage and destroy than to assist
the settlement, were the seditious chiefs, who easily led this
band into every kind of extravagance and excess. See for the
history of Virginia the following works:—
“History of Virginia, from the First Settlements in the year
1624,” by Smith.
“History of Virginia,” by William Stith.
“History of Virginia, from the Earliest Period,” by Beverley.

***It was not till some time later that a certain number of
rich English capitalists came to fix themselves in the colony.
****Slavery was introduced about the year 1620 by a Dutch
vessel which landed twenty negroes on the banks of the river
James. See Chalmer.

In the North, the same English foundation was modified
by the most opposite shades of character; and here I may be
allowed to enter into some details. The two or three main
ideas which constitute the basis of the social theory of the
United States were first combined in the Northern English
colonies, more generally denominated the States of New
England.* The principles of New England spread at first to
the neighboring states; they then passed successively to the
more distant ones; and at length they imbued the whole
Confederation. They now extend their influence beyond its
limits over the whole American world. The civilization of
New England has been like a beacon lit upon a hill, which,
after it has diffused its warmth around, tinges the distant
horizon with its glow.
The foundation of New England was a novel spectacle,
and all the circumstances attending it were singular and origi-
nal. The large majority of colonies have been first inhabited

either by men without education and without resources,
driven by their poverty and their misconduct from the land
which gave them birth, or by speculators and adventurers
greedy of gain. Some settlements cannot even boast so hon-
orable an origin; St. Domingo was founded by buccaneers;
and the criminal courts of England originally supplied the
population of Australia.
The settlers who established themselves on the shores of
New England all belonged to the more independent classes
of their native country. Their union on the soil of America at
once presented the singular phenomenon of a society con-
taining neither lords nor common people, neither rich nor
poor. These men possessed, in proportion to their number, a
greater mass of intelligence than is to be found in any Euro-
pean nation of our own time. All, without a single excep-
tion, had received a good education, and many of them were
known in Europe for their talents and their acquirements.
The other colonies had been founded by adventurers with-
out family; the emigrants of New England brought with them
the best elements of order and morality -they landed in the
desert accompanied by their wives and children. But what

*The States of New England are those situated to the east of
the Hudson; they are now six in number: 1, Connecticut; 2,

shire; 6, Maine.

most especially distinguished them was the aim of their un-
dertaking. They had not been obliged by necessity to leave
their country; the social position they abandoned was one to
be regretted, and their means of subsistence were certain.
Nor did they cross the Atlantic to improve their situation or
to increase their wealth; the call which summoned them from
the comforts of their homes was purely intellectual; and in
facing the inevitable sufferings of exile their object was the
triumph of an idea.
The emigrants, or, as they deservedly styled themselves,
the Pilgrims, belonged to that English sect the austerity of
whose principles had acquired for them the name of Puri-
tans. Puritanism was not merely a religious doctrine, but it
corresponded in many points with the most absolute demo-
cratic and republican theories. It was this tendency which
had aroused its most dangerous adversaries. Persecuted by
the Government of the mother-country, and disgusted by
the habits of a society opposed to the rigor of their own prin-
ciples, the Puritans went forth to seek some rude and unfre-
quented part of the world, where they could live according
to their own opinions, and worship God in freedom.

A few quotations will throw more light upon the spirit of
these pious adventures than all we can say of them. Nathaniel
Morton, * the historian of the first years of the settlement,
thus opens his subject:
“Gentle Reader, – I have for some length of time looked
upon it as a duty incumbent, especially on the immediate
successors of those that have had so large experience of those
many memorable and signal demonstrations of God’s good-
ness, viz., the first beginners of this Plantation in New En-
gland, to commit to writing his gracious dispensations on
that behalf; having so many inducements thereunto, not
onely otherwise but so plentifully in the Sacred Scriptures:
that so, what we have seen, and what our fathers have told us
(Psalm lxxviii. 3, 4), we may not hide from our children,
showing to the generations to come the praises of the Lord;
that especially the seed of Abraham his servant, and the chil-
dren of Jacob his chosen (Psalm cv. 5, 6), may remember his
marvellous works in the beginning and progress of the plant-
ing of New England, his wonders and the judgments of his

mouth; how that God brought a vine into this wilderness;

that he cast out the heathen, and planted it; that he made

room for it and caused it to take deep root; and it filled the

land (Psalm lxxx. 8, 9). And not onely so, but also that he

hath guided his people by his strength to his holy habitation

and planted them in the mountain of his inheritance in re-

spect of precious Gospel enjoyments: and that as especially

God may have the glory of all unto whom it is most due; so

also some rays of glory may reach the names of those blessed

Saints that were the main instruments and the beginning of

this happy enterprise.”

It is impossible to read this opening paragraph without an

involuntary feeling of religious awe; it breathes the very sa-

vor of Gospel antiquity. The sincerity of the author height-

ens his power of language. The band which to his eyes was a

mere party of adventurers gone forth to seek their fortune

beyond seas appears to the reader as the germ of a great na-

tion wafted by Providence to a predestined shore.

The author thus continues his narrative of the departure

of the first pilgrims:—

“So they left that goodly and pleasant city of Leyden,*

which had been their resting-place for above eleven years;
but they knew that they were pilgrims and strangers here
below, and looked not much on these things, but lifted up
their eyes to Heaven, their dearest country, where God hath
prepared for them a city (Heb. xi. 16), and therein quieted
their spirits. When they came to Delfs- Haven they found
the ship and all things ready; and such of their friends as
could not come with them followed after them, and sundry

from the North of England, who had quitted their native
country because they were “studious of reformation, and
entered into covenant to walk with one another according to
the primitive pattern of the Word of God.” They emigrated
to Holland, and settled in the city of Leyden in 1610, where
they abode, being lovingly respected by the Dutch, for many
years: they left it in 1620 for several reasons, the last of which
was, that their posterity would in a few generations become
Dutch, and so lose their interest in the English nation; they
being desirous rather to enlarge His Majesty’s dominions,
and to live under their natural prince. – Translator’s Note.

site of the town of Plymouth. The rock is still shown on

“But before we pass on,” continues our historian, “let the
reader with me make a pause and seriously consider this poor
people’s present condition, the more to be raised up to ad-
miration of God’s goodness towards them in their preserva-
tion: for being now passed the vast ocean, and a sea of troubles
before them in expectation, they had now no friends to wel-
come them, no inns to entertain or refresh them, no houses,
or much less towns to repair unto to seek for succour: and

of the country know them to be sharp and violent, subject

Charles I drove fresh crowds of sectarians every year to the
shores of America. In England the stronghold of Puritanism
was in the middle classes, and it was from the middle classes
that the majority of the emigrants came. The population of
New England increased rapidly; and whilst the hierarchy of
rank despotically classed the inhabitants of the mother-coun-
try, the colony continued to present the novel spectacle of a
community homogeneous in all its parts. A democracy, more
perfect than any which antiquity had dreamt of, started in full
size and panoply from the midst of an ancient feudal society.

Chapter II: Origin Of The Anglo-Americans –
Part II

The English Government was not dissatisfied with an emi-
gration which removed the elements of fresh discord and of
further revolutions. On the contrary, everything was done
to encourage it, and great exertions were made to mitigate
the hardships of those who sought a shelter from the rigor of
their country’s laws on the soil of America. It seemed as if
New England was a region given up to the dreams of fancy
and the unrestrained experiments of innovators.
The English colonies (and this is one of the main causes of
their prosperity) have always enjoyed more internal freedom
and more political independence than the colonies of other
nations; but this principle of liberty was nowhere more ex-
tensively applied than in the States of New England.
It was generally allowed at that period that the territories
of the New World belonged to that European nation which
had been the first to discover them. Nearly the whole coast
of North America thus became a British possession towards
the end of the sixteenth century. The means used by the

English Government to people these new domains were of
several kinds; the King sometimes appointed a governor of
his own choice, who ruled a portion of the New World in
the name and under the immediate orders of the Crown;*
this is the colonial system adopted by other countries of
Europe. Sometimes grants of certain tracts were made by the
Crown to an individual or to a company,** in which case all
the civil and political power fell into the hands of one or
more persons, who, under the inspection and control of the
Crown, sold the lands and governed the inhabitants. Lastly,
a third system consisted in allowing a certain number of
emigrants to constitute a political society under the protec-
tion of the mother-country, and to govern themselves in
whatever was not contrary to her laws. This mode of coloni-
zation, so remarkably favorable to liberty, was only adopted
in New England.***
*This was the case in the State of New York.
**Maryland, the Carolinas, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey were
in this situation. See “Pitkin’s History,” vol. i. pp. 11-31.
***See the work entitled “Historical Collection of State Pa-
pers and other authentic Documents intended as materials

for a History of the United States of America, by Ebenezer
Hasard. Philadelphia, 1792,” for a great number of docu-
ments relating to the commencement of the colonies, which
are valuable from their contents and their authenticity:
amongst them are the various charters granted by the King
of England, and the first acts of the local governments.
See also the analysis of all these charters given by Mr. Story,
Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the In-
troduction to his “Commentary on the Constitution of the
United States.” It results from these documents that the prin-
ciples of representative government and the external forms
of political liberty were introduced into all the colonies at
their origin. These principles were more fully acted upon in
the North than in the South, but they existed everywhere.

In 1628* a charter of this kind was granted by Charles I to
the emigrants who went to form the colony of Massachu-
setts. But, in general, charters were not given to the colonies
of New England till they had acquired a certain existence.
Plymouth, Providence, New Haven, the State of Connecti-
cut, and that of Rhode Island** were founded without the
co-operation and almost without the knowledge of the
mother-country. The new settlers did not derive their incor-
poration from the seat of the empire, although they did not
deny its supremacy; they constituted a society of their own
accord, and it was not till thirty or forty years afterwards,
under Charles II. that their existence was legally recognized
by a royal charter.
This frequently renders its it difficult to detect the link
which connected the emigrants with the land of their forefa-
thers in studying the earliest historical and legislative records
of New England. They exercised the rights of sovereignty;
they named their magistrates, concluded peace or declared

war, made police regulations, and enacted laws as if their
allegiance was due only to God.* Nothing can be more curi-
ous and, at the same time more instructive, than the legisla-
tion of that period; it is there that the solution of the great
social problem which the United States now present to the
world is to be found.
Amongst these documents we shall notice, as especially
characteristic, the code of laws promulgated by the little State
of Connecticut in 1650.** The legislators of Connecticut***
begin with the penal laws, and, strange to say, they borrow
their provisions from the text of Holy Writ. “Whosoever shall
worship any other God than the Lord,” says the preamble of
the Code, “shall surely be put to death.” This is followed by
ten or twelve enactments of the same kind, copied verbatim

of Massachusetts Bay,” by Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 9.

*The inhabitants of Massachusetts had deviated from the
forms which are preserved in the criminal and civil proce-
dure of England; in 1650 the decrees of justice were not yet
headed by the royal style. See Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 452.

***See also in “Hutchinson’s History,” vol. i. pp. 435, 456,

ciples as that of Connecticut.

from the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy.
Blasphemy, sorcery, adultery,* and rape were punished with
death; an outrage offered by a son to his parents was to be
expiated by the same penalty. The legislation of a rude and
half-civilized people was thus applied to an enlightened and
moral community. The consequence was that the punish-
ment of death was never more frequently prescribed by the
statute, and never more rarely enforced towards the guilty.
The chief care of the legislators, in this body of penal laws,
was the maintenance of orderly conduct and good morals in
the community: they constantly invaded the domain of con-
science, and there was scarcely a sin which was not subject to
magisterial censure. The reader is aware of the rigor with
which these laws punished rape and adultery; intercourse

between unmarried persons was likewise severely repressed.
The judge was empowered to inflict a pecuniary penalty, a
whipping, or marriage * on the misdemeanants; and if the
records of the old courts of New Haven may be believed,
prosecutions of this kind were not unfrequent. We find a
sentence bearing date the first of May, 1660, inflicting a fine
and reprimand on a young woman who was accused of us-
ing improper language, and of allowing herself to be kissed.**
The Code of 1650 abounds in preventive measures. It pun-
ishes idleness and drunkenness with severity.*** Innkeepers
are forbidden to furnish more than a certain quantity of li-
quor to each consumer; and simple lying, whenever it may

*Adultery was also punished with death by the law of Massa-
chusetts: and Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 441, says that several per-
sons actually suffered for this crime. He quotes a curious an-
ecdote on this subject, which occurred in the year 1663. A
married woman had had criminal intercourse with a young
man; her husband died, and she married the lover. Several
years had elapsed, when the public began to suspect the previ-
ous intercourse of this couple: they were thrown into prison,
put upon trial, and very narrowly escaped capital punishment.

*Code of 1650, p. 48. It seems sometimes to have happened
that the judges superadded these punishments to each other,
as is seen in a sentence pronounced in 1643 (p. 114, “New
Haven Antiquities”), by which Margaret Bedford, convicted
of loose conduct, was condemned to be whipped, and after-
wards to marry Nicholas Jemmings, her accomplice.

History,” for several causes equally extraordinary.

be injurious,* is checked by a fine or a flogging. In other
places, the legislator, entirely forgetting the great principles
of religious toleration which he had himself upheld in Eu-
rope, renders attendance on divine service compulsory,** and
goes so far as to visit with severe punishment,  and even with
death, the Christians who chose to worship God according
to a ritual differing from his own.*** Sometimes indeed the
zeal of his enactments induces him to descend to the most
frivolous particulars: thus a law is to be found in the same
Code which prohibits the use of tobacco.***** It must not
be forgotten that these fantastical and vexatious laws were
not imposed by authority, but that they were freely voted by
all the persons interested, and that the manners of the com-
munity were even more austere and more puritanical than
the laws. In 1649 a solemn association was formed in Bos-
ton to check the worldly luxury of long hair. ******
*Ibid., p. 64.
**Ibid., p. 44.
***This was not peculiar to Connecticut. See, for instance,
the law which, on September 13, 1644, banished the
Anabaptists from the State of Massachusetts. (“Historical

Collection of State Papers,” vol. i. p. 538.) See also the law
against the Quakers, passed on October 14, 1656: “Whereas,”
says the preamble, “an accursed race of heretics called Quak-
ers has sprung up,” etc. The clauses of the statute inflict a
heavy fine on all captains of ships who should import Quak-
ers into the country. The Quakers who may be found there
shall be whipped and imprisoned with hard labor. Those
members of the sect who should defend their opinions shall
be first fined, then imprisoned, and finally driven out of the
province. – “Historical Collection of State Papers,” vol. i. p.
630.

who should set foot in the colony after having been once

These errors are no doubt discreditable to human reason;
they attest the inferiority of our nature, which is incapable
of laying firm hold upon what is true and just, and is often
reduced to the alternative of two excesses. In strict connec-
tion with this penal legislation, which bears such striking
marks of a narrow sectarian spirit, and of those religious pas-
sions which had been warmed by persecution and were still
fermenting among the people, a body of political laws is to
be found, which, though written two hundred years ago, is
still ahead of the liberties of our age. The general principles
which are the groundwork of modern constitutions – prin-
ciples which were imperfectly known in Europe, and not
completely triumphant even in Great Britain, in the seven-
teenth century – were all recognized and determined by the
laws of New England: the intervention of the people in pub-
lic affairs, the free voting of taxes, the responsibility of au-
thorities, personal liberty, and trial by jury, were all posi-
tively established without discussion. From these fruitful
principles consequences have been derived and applications
have been made such as no nation in Europe has yet ven-
tured to attempt.

In Connecticut the electoral body consisted, from its ori-
gin, of the whole number of citizens; and this is readily to be
understood,* when we recollect that this people enjoyed an
almost perfect equality of fortune, and a still greater unifor-
mity of opinions.** In Connecticut, at this period, all the
executive functionaries were elected, including the Gover-
nor of the State.*** The citizens above the age of sixteen
were obliged to bear arms; they formed a national militia,
which appointed its own officers, and was to hold itself at all
times in readiness to march for the defence of the country.****

In the laws of Connecticut, as well as in all those of New
England, we find the germ and gradual development of that
township independence which is the life and mainspring of

*Constitution of 1638, p. 17.
**In 1641 the General Assembly of Rhode Island unani-
mously declared that the government of the State was a de-
mocracy, and that the power was vested in the body of free

watch their execution. – Code of 1650, p. 70.

American liberty at the present day. The political existence
of the majority of the nations of Europe commenced in the
superior ranks of society, and was gradually and imperfectly
communicated to the different members of the social body.
In America, on the other hand, it may be said that the town-
ship was organized before the county, the county before the
State, the State before the Union. In New England town-
ships were completely and definitively constituted as early as
1650. The independence of the township was the nucleus
round which the local interests, passions, rights, and duties
collected and clung. It gave scope to the activity of a real
political life most thoroughly democratic and republican. The
colonies still recognized the supremacy of the mother-coun-
try; monarchy was still the law of the State; but the republic
was already established in every township. The towns named
their own magistrates of every kind, rated themselves, and
levied their own taxes.* In the parish of New England the
law of representation was not adopted, but the affairs of the
community were discussed, as at Athens, in the market-place,
by a general assembly of the citizens.
*Code of 1650, p. 80.

In studying the laws which were promulgated at this first
era of the American republics, it is impossible not to be struck
by the remarkable acquaintance with the science of govern-
ment and the advanced theory of legislation which they dis-
play. The ideas there formed of the duties of society towards
its members are evidently much loftier and more compre-
hensive than those of the European legislators at that time:
obligations were there imposed which were elsewhere slighted.
In the States of New England, from the first, the condition
of the poor was provided for;* strict measures were taken for
the maintenance of roads, and surveyors were appointed to
attend to them;** registers were established in every parish,
in which the results of public deliberations, and the births,
deaths, and marriages of the citizens were entered;*** clerks
were directed to keep these registers;**** officers were charged
with the administration of vacant inheritances, and with the
arbitration of litigated landmarks; and many others were cre-
ated whose chief functions were the maintenance of public
order in the community.***** The law enters into a thou-

sand useful provisions for a number of social wants which
are at present very inadequately felt in France.
But it is by the attention it pays to Public Education that
the original character of American civilization is at once placed
in the clearest light. “It being,” says the law, “one chief project
of Satan to keep men from the knowledge of the Scripture
by persuading from the use of tongues, to the end that learn-
ing may not be buried in the graves of our forefathers, in
church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our endeav-
ors. . . .”* Here follow clauses establishing schools in every
township, and obliging the inhabitants, under pain of heavy
fines, to support them. Schools of a superior kind were
founded in the same manner in the more populous districts.
The municipal authorities were bound to enforce the send-
ing of children to school by their parents; they were empow-
ered to inflict fines upon all who refused compliance; and in
case of continued resistance society assumed the place of the
parent, took possession of the child, and deprived the father
of those natural rights which he used to so bad a purpose.
The reader will undoubtedly have remarked the preamble of

by the imagination of the citizens. In the bosom of this ob-
scure democracy, which had as yet brought forth neither gen-
erals, nor philosophers, nor authors, a man might stand up
in the face of a free people and pronounce the following fine
definition of liberty.*

“Nor would I have you to mistake in the point of your
own liberty. There is a liberty of a corrupt nature which is
effected both by men and beasts to do what they list, and
this liberty is inconsistent with authority, impatient of all
restraint; by this liberty ‘sumus omnes deteriores’: ’tis the
grand enemy of truth and peace, and all the ordinances of
God are bent against it. But there is a civil, a moral, a federal
liberty which is the proper end and object of authority; it is
a liberty for that only which is just and good: for this liberty
you are to stand with the hazard of your very lives and what-
soever crosses it is not authority, but a distemper thereof.

*Mather’s “Magnalia Christi Americana,” vol. ii. p. 13. This
speech was made by Winthrop; he was accused of having
committed arbitrary actions during his magistracy, but after
having made the speech of which the above is a fragment, he
was acquitted by acclamation, and from that time forwards
he was always re- elected governor of the State. See Marshal,
vol. i. p. 166.

These two tendencies, apparently so discrepant, are far from
conflicting; they advance together, and mutually support each
other. Religion perceives that civil liberty affords a noble ex-
ercise to the faculties of man, and that the political world is
a field prepared by the Creator for the efforts of the intelli-
gence. Contented with the freedom and the power which it
enjoys in its own sphere, and with the place which it occu-
pies, the empire of religion is never more surely established
than when it reigns in the hearts of men unsupported by
aught beside its native strength. Religion is no less the com-
panion of liberty in all its battles and its triumphs; the cradle
of its infancy, and the divine source of its claims. The safe-
guard of morality is religion, and morality is the best secu-
rity of law and the surest pledge of freedom.*

toms Of The Anglo-Americans Present

absolute an inference from what has been said. The social
condition, the religion, and the manners of the first emi-
grants undoubtedly exercised an immense influence on the
destiny of their new country. Nevertheless they were not in a
situation to found a state of things solely dependent on them-
selves: no man can entirely shake off the influence of the
past, and the settlers, intentionally or involuntarily, mingled
habits and notions derived from their education and from
the traditions of their country with those habits and notions
which were exclusively their own. To form a judgment on
the Anglo-Americans of the present day it is therefore neces-
sary to distinguish what is of Puritanical and what is of En-
glish origin.
Laws and customs are frequently to be met with in the
United States which contrast strongly with all that surrounds
them. These laws seem to be drawn up in a spirit contrary to
the prevailing tenor of the American legislation; and these
customs are no less opposed to the tone of society. If the
English colonies had been founded in an age of darkness, or
if their origin was already lost in the lapse of years, the prob-
lem would be insoluble.

I shall quote a single example to illustrate what I advance.
The civil and criminal procedure of the Americans has only
two means of action -committal and bail. The first measure
taken by the magistrate is to exact security from the defen-
dant, or, in case of refusal, to incarcerate him: the ground of
the accusation and the importance of the charges against him
are then discussed. It is evident that a legislation of this kind
is hostile to the poor man, and favorable only to the rich.
The poor man has not always a security to produce, even in
a civil cause; and if he is obliged to wait for justice in prison,
he is speedily reduced to distress. The wealthy individual, on
the contrary, always escapes imprisonment in civil causes;
nay, more, he may readily elude the punishment which awaits
him for a delinquency by breaking his bail. So that all the
penalties of the law are, for him, reducible to fines.* Noth-
ing can be more aristocratic than this system of legislation.
Yet in America it is the poor who make the law, and they
usually reserve the greatest social advantages to themselves.
The explanation of the phenomenon is to be found in En-
gland; the laws of which I speak are English,** and the Ameri-
*Crimes no doubt exist for which bail is inadmissible, but
they are few in number.]

cans have retained them, however repugnant they may be to
the tenor of their legislation and the mass of their ideas. Next
to its habits, the thing which a nation is least apt to change is
its civil legislation. Civil laws are only familiarly known to
legal men, whose direct interest it is to maintain them as
they are, whether good or bad, simply because they them-
selves are conversant with them. The body of the nation is
scarcely acquainted with them; it merely perceives their ac-
tion in particular cases; but it has some difficulty in seizing
their tendency, and obeys them without premeditation. I have
quoted one instance where it would have been easy to ad-
duce a great number of others. The surface of American so-
ciety is, if I may use the expression, covered with a layer of
democracy, from beneath which the old aristocratic colors
sometimes peep.

Chapter III: Social Conditions
of the Anglo-Americans

Chapter Summary

A Social condition is commonly the result of circumstances,
sometimes of laws, oftener still of these two causes united;
but wherever it exists, it may justly be considered as the source
of almost all the laws, the usages, and the ideas which regu-
late the conduct of nations; whatever it does not produce it
modifies. It is therefore necessary, if we would become ac-
quainted with the legislation and the manners of a nation,
to begin by the study of its social condition.

The Striking Characteristic of the Social Condi-
tion of the Anglo-Americans in Its Essential
Democracy

The first emigrants of New England – Their equality – Aris-
tocratic laws introduced in the South – Period of the Revo-
lution – Change in the law of descent – Effects produced by

this change – Democracy carried to its utmost limits in the
new States of the West – Equality of education.

Many important observations suggest themselves upon the
social condition of the Anglo-Americans, but there is one
which takes precedence of all the rest. The social condition
of the Americans is eminently democratic; this was its char-
acter at the foundation of the Colonies, and is still more
strongly marked at the present day. I have stated in the pre-
ceding chapter that great equality existed among the emi-
grants who settled on the shores of New England. The germ
of aristocracy was never planted in that part of the Union.
The only influence which obtained there was that of intel-
lect; the people were used to reverence certain names as the
emblems of knowledge and virtue. Some of their fellow-citi-
zens acquired a power over the rest which might truly have
been called aristocratic, if it had been capable of transmis-
sion from father to son.
This was the state of things to the east of the Hudson: to
the south-west of that river, and in the direction of the
Floridas, the case was different. In most of the States situ-

At the period of which we are now speaking society was
shaken to its centre: the people, in whose name the struggle
had taken place, conceived the desire of exercising the au-
thority which it had acquired; its democratic tendencies were
awakened; and having thrown off the yoke of the mother-
country, it aspired to independence of every kind. The influ-
ence of individuals gradually ceased to be felt, and custom
and law united together to produce the same result.
But the law of descent was the last step to equality. I am
surprised that ancient and modern jurists have not attrib-
uted to this law a greater influence on human affairs.* It is
true that these laws belong to civil affairs; but they ought
nevertheless to be placed at the head of all political institu-
tions; for, whilst political laws are only the symbol of a nation’s

*I understand by the law of descent all those laws whose
principal object is to regulate the distribution of property
after the death of its owner. The law of entail is of this num-
ber; it certainly prevents the owner from disposing of his
possessions before his death; but this is solely with the view
of preserving them entire for the heir. The principal object,
therefore, of the law of entail is to regulate the descent of
property after the death of its owner: its other provisions are
merely means to this end.

when it decrees, the equal division of a father’s property
amongst all his children, its effects are of two kinds: it is
important to distinguish them from each other, although
they tend to the same end.
In virtue of the law of partible inheritance, the death of
every proprietor brings about a kind of revolution in prop-
erty; not only do his possessions change hands, but their
very nature is altered, since they are parcelled into shares,
which become smaller and smaller at each division. This is
the direct and, as it were, the physical effect of the law. It
follows, then, that in countries where equality of inheritance
is established by law, property, and especially landed prop-
erty, must have a tendency to perpetual diminution. The
effects, however, of such legislation would only be percep-
tible after a lapse of time, if the law was abandoned to its
own working; for supposing the family to consist of two chil-
dren (and in a country people as France is the average num-
ber is not above three), these children, sharing amongst them
the fortune of both parents, would not be poorer than their
father or mother.
But the law of equal division exercises its influence not

merely upon the property itself, but it affects the minds of
the heirs, and brings their passions into play. These indirect
consequences tend powerfully to the destruction of large for-
tunes, and especially of large domains. Among nations whose
law of descent is founded upon the right of primogeniture
landed estates often pass from generation to generation with-
out undergoing division, the consequence of which is that
family feeling is to a certain degree incorporated with the
estate. The family represents the estate, the estate the family;
whose name, together with its origin, its glory, its power,
and its virtues, is thus perpetuated in an imperishable me-
morial of the past and a sure pledge of the future.
When the equal partition of property is established by law,
the intimate connection is destroyed between family feeling
and the preservation of the paternal estate; the property ceases
to represent the family; for as it must inevitably be divided
after one or two generations, it has evidently a constant ten-
dency to diminish, and must in the end be completely dis-
persed. The sons of the great landed proprietor, if they are
few in number, or if fortune befriends them, may indeed
entertain the hope of being as wealthy as their father, but
not that of possessing the same property as he did; the riches

must necessarily be composed of elements different from his.
Now, from the moment that you divest the landowner of
that interest in the preservation of his estate which he derives
from association, from tradition, and from family pride, you
may be certain that sooner or later he will dispose of it; for
there is a strong pecuniary interest in favor of selling, as float-
ing capital produces higher interest than real property, and is
more readily available to gratify the passions of the moment.
Great landed estates which have once been divided never
come together again; for the small proprietor draws from his
land a better revenue, in proportion, than the large owner does
from his, and of course he sells it at a higher rate.* The calcu-
lations of gain, therefore, which decide the rich man to sell his
domain will still more powerfully influence him against buy-
ing small estates to unite them into a large one.
What is called family pride is often founded upon an illu-
sion of self-love. A man wishes to perpetuate and immortal-
ize himself, as it were, in his great-grandchildren. Where the
esprit de famille ceases to act individual selfishness comes
into play. When the idea of family becomes vague, indeter-
minate, and uncertain, a man thinks of his present conve-
nience; he provides for the establishment of his succeeding
generation, and no more. Either a man gives up the idea of
perpetuating his family, or at any rate he seeks to accomplish

it by other means than that of a landed estate. Thus not only
does the law of partible inheritance render it difficult for
families to preserve their ancestral domains entire, but it de-
prives them of the inclination to attempt it, and compels
them in some measure to co-operate with the law in their
own extinction.
The law of equal distribution proceeds by two methods:
by acting upon things, it acts upon persons; by influencing
persons, it affects things. By these means the law succeeds in
striking at the root of landed property, and dispersing rap-
idly both families and fortunes.*
*Land being the most stable kind of property, we find, from
time to time, rich individuals who are disposed to make great
sacrifices in order to obtain it, and who willingly forfeit a con-
siderable part of their income to make sure of the rest. But these
are accidental cases. The preference for landed property is no
longer found habitually in any class but among the poor. The
small landowner, who has less information, less imagination,
and fewer passions than the great one, is generally occupied
with the desire of increasing his estate: and it often happens that
by inheritance, by marriage, or by the chances of trade, he is
gradually furnished with the means. Thus, to balance the ten-
dency which leads men to divide their estates, there exists an-
other, which incites them to add to them. This tendency, which
is sufficient to prevent estates from being divided ad infinitum,
is not strong enough to create great territorial possessions, cer-
tainly not to keep them up in the same family.

*I do not mean to say that the small proprietor cultivates his
land better, but he cultivates it with more ardor and care; so
that he makes up by his labor for his want of skill.

Most certainly it is not for us Frenchmen of the nineteenth
century, who daily witness the political and social changes
which the law of partition is bringing to pass, to question its
influence. It is perpetually conspicuous in our country, over-
throwing the walls of our dwellings and removing the land-
marks of our fields. But although it has produced great ef-
fects in France, much still remains for it to do. Our recollec-
tions, opinions, and habits present powerful obstacles to its
progress.
In the United States it has nearly completed its work of
destruction, and there we can best study its results. The En-
glish laws concerning the transmission of property were abol-
ished in almost all the States at the time of the Revolution.
The law of entail was so modified as not to interrupt the free
circulation of property.* The first generation having passed
away, estates began to be parcelled out, and the change be-
came more and more rapid with the progress of time. At this
moment, after a lapse of a little more than sixty years, the
aspect of society is totally altered; the families of the great
landed proprietors are almost all commingled with the gen-

eral mass. In the State of New York, which formerly con-
tained many of these, there are but two who still keep their
heads above the stream, and they must shortly disappear.
The sons of these opulent citizens are become merchants,
lawyers, or physicians. Most of them have lapsed into obscu-
rity. The last trace of hereditary ranks and distinctions is de-
stroyed – the law of partition has reduced all to one level.
I do not mean that there is any deficiency of wealthy indi-
viduals in the United States; I know of no country, indeed,
where the love of money has taken stronger hold on the af-
fections of men, and where the profounder contempt is ex-
pressed for the theory of the permanent equality of property.
But wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and expe-
rience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding genera-
tions in the full enjoyment of it.
This picture, which may perhaps be thought to be over-
charged, still gives a very imperfect idea of what is taking
place in the new States of the West and South-west. At the
end of the last century a few bold adventurers began to pen-
etrate into the valleys of the Mississippi, and the mass of the
population very soon began to move in that direction: com-

munities unheard of till then were seen to emerge from the
wilds: States whose names were not in existence a few years
before claimed their place in the American Union; and in
the Western settlements we may behold democracy arrived
at its utmost extreme. In these States, founded off-hand, and,
as it were, by chance, the inhabitants are but of yesterday.
Scarcely known to one another, the nearest neighbors are
ignorant of each other’s history. In this part of the American
continent, therefore, the population has not experienced the
influence of great names and great wealth, nor even that of
the natural aristocracy of knowledge and virtue. None are
there to wield that respectable power which men willingly
grant to the remembrance of a life spent in doing good be-
fore their eyes. The new States of the West are already inhab-
ited, but society has no existence among them.*

It is not only the fortunes of men which are equal in
America; even their requirements partake in some degree of
the same uniformity. I do not believe that there is a country

*This may have been true in 1832, but is not so in 1874,
when great cities like Chicago and San Francisco have sprung
up in the Western States. But as yet the Western States exert
no powerful influence on American society. – Translator’s Note.

scarcely assign to it any degree of influence in the course of
affairs. The democratic principle, on the contrary, has gained
so much strength by time, by events, and by legislation, as to
have become not only predominant but all-powerful. There is
no family or corporate authority, and it is rare to find even the
influence of individual character enjoy any durability.
America, then, exhibits in her social state a most extraordi-
nary phenomenon. Men are there seen on a greater equality in
point of fortune and intellect, or, in other words, more equal
in their strength, than in any other country of the world, or in
any age of which history has preserved the remembrance.

Political Consequences of the Social Condition
of the Anglo-Americans

The political consequences of such a social condition as this
are easily deducible. It is impossible to believe that equality
will not eventually find its way into the political world as it
does everywhere else. To conceive of men remaining forever
unequal upon one single point, yet equal on all others, is
impossible; they must come in the end to be equal upon all.

themselves to their disappointment; but nothing can satisfy
them except equality, and rather than lose it they resolve to
perish.
On the other hand, in a State where the citizens are nearly
on an equality, it becomes difficult for them to preserve their
independence against the aggressions of power. No one
among them being strong enough to engage in the struggle
with advantage, nothing but a general combination can pro-
tect their liberty. And such a union is not always to be found.
From the same social position, then, nations may derive
one or the other of two great political results; these results
are extremely different from each other, but they may both
proceed from the same cause.
The Anglo-Americans are the first nations who, having
been exposed to this formidable alternative, have been happy
enough to escape the dominion of absolute power. They have
been allowed by their circumstances, their origin, their in-
telligence, and especially by their moral feeling, to establish
and maintain the sovereignty of the people.

Chapter IV: The Principle of the Sovereignty of
the People in America

Chapter Summary

It predominates over the whole of society in America – Ap-
plication made of this principle by the Americans even be-
fore their Revolution – Development given to it by that Revo-
lution – Gradual and irresistible extension of the elective
qualification.

The Principle of the Sovereignty of the People
in America

Whenever the political laws of the United States are to be
discussed, it is with the doctrine of the sovereignty of the
people that we must begin. The principle of the sovereignty
of the people, which is to be found, more or less, at the bot-
tom of almost all human institutions, generally remains con-
cealed from view. It is obeyed without being recognized, or
if for a moment it be brought to light, it is hastily cast back

victories obtained for it, until it became the law of laws.
A no less rapid change was effected in the interior of soci-
ety, where the law of descent completed the abolition of lo-
cal influences.
At the very time when this consequence of the laws and of
the revolution was apparent to every eye, victory was irrevo-
cably pronounced in favor of the democratic cause. All power
was, in fact, in its hands, and resistance was no longer pos-
sible. The higher orders submitted without a murmur and
without a struggle to an evil which was thenceforth inevi-
table. The ordinary fate of falling powers awaited them; each
of their several members followed his own interests; and as it
was impossible to wring the power from the hands of a people
which they did not detest sufficiently to brave, their only
aim was to secure its good-will at any price. The most demo-
cratic laws were consequently voted by the very men whose
interests they impaired; and thus, although the higher classes
did not excite the passions of the people against their order,
they accelerated the triumph of the new state of things; so
that by a singular change the democratic impulse was found
to be most irresistible in the very States where the aristocracy

had the firmest hold. The State of Maryland, which had been
founded by men of rank, was the first to proclaim universal
suffrage, and to introduce the most democratic forms into
the conduct of its government.
When a nation modifies the elective qualification, it may
easily be foreseen that sooner or later that qualification will
be entirely abolished. There is no more invariable rule in the
history of society: the further electoral rights are extended,
the greater is the need of extending them; for after each con-
cession the strength of the democracy increases, and its de-
mands increase with its strength. The ambition of those who
are below the appointed rate is irritated in exact proportion
to the great number of those who are above it. The excep-
tion at last becomes the rule, concession follows concession,
and no stop can be made short of universal suffrage.
At the present day the principle of the sovereignty of the
people has acquired, in the United States, all the practical
development which the imagination can conceive. It is un-
encumbered by those fictions which have been thrown over
it in other countries, and it appears in every possible form
according to the exigency of the occasion. Sometimes the

laws are made by the people in a body, as at Athens; and
sometimes its representatives, chosen by universal suffrage,
transact business in its name, and almost under its immedi-
ate control.
In some countries a power exists which, though it is in a
degree foreign to the social body, directs it, and forces it to
pursue a certain track. In others the ruling force is divided,
being partly within and partly without the ranks of the people.
But nothing of the kind is to be seen in the United States;
there society governs itself for itself. All power centres in its
bosom; and scarcely an individual is to be meet with who
would venture to conceive, or, still less, to express, the idea
of seeking it elsewhere. The nation participates in the mak-
ing of its laws by the choice of its legislators, and in the ex-
ecution of them by the choice of the agents of the executive
government; it may almost be said to govern itself, so feeble
and so restricted is the share left to the administration, so
little do the authorities forget their popular origin and the
power from which they emanate.*

Chapter V: Necessity of Examining
the Condition of the States – Part I

Necessity Of Examining The Condition Of The
States Before That Of The Union At Large

It is proposed to examine in the following chapter what is
the form of government established in America on the prin-
ciple of the sovereignty of the people; what are its resources,
its hindrances, its advantages, and its dangers. The first diffi-
culty which presents itself arises from the complex nature of
the constitution of the United States, which consists of two
distinct social structures, connected and, as it were, encased
one within the other; two governments, completely separate
and almost independent, the one fulfilling the ordinary du-
ties and responding to the daily and indefinite calls of a com-
munity, the other circumscribed within certain limits, and
only exercising an exceptional authority over the general in-
terests of the country. In short, there are twenty- four small
sovereign nations, whose agglomeration constitutes the body
of the Union. To examine the Union before we have studied

ship is the lowest in order, then the county, and lastly the
State; and I propose to devote the following chapter to the
examination of these three divisions.

The American System of Townships
and Municipal Bodies

Why the Author begins the examination of the political in-
stitutions with the township – Its existence in all nations -
Difficulty of establishing and preserving municipal indepen-
dence – Its importance – Why the Author has selected the
township system of New England as the main topic of his
discussion.
It is not undesignedly that I begin this subject with the
Township. The village or township is the only association
which is so perfectly natural that wherever a number of men
are collected it seems to constitute itself.
The town, or tithing, as the smallest division of a commu-
nity, must necessarily exist in all nations, whatever their laws
and customs may be: if man makes monarchies and estab-
lishes republics, the first association of mankind seems con-

stituted by the hand of God. But although the existence of
the township is coeval with that of man, its liberties are not
the less rarely respected and easily destroyed. A nation is al-
ways able to establish great political assemblies, because it
habitually contains a certain number of individuals fitted by
their talents, if not by their habits, for the direction of af-
fairs. The township is, on the contrary, composed of coarser
materials, which are less easily fashioned by the legislator.
The difficulties which attend the consolidation of its inde-
pendence rather augment than diminish with the increasing
enlightenment of the people. A highly civilized community
spurns the attempts of a local independence, is disgusted at
its numerous blunders, and is apt to despair of success be-
fore the experiment is completed. Again, no immunities are
so ill protected from the encroachments of the supreme power
as those of municipal bodies in general: they are unable to
struggle, single- handed, against a strong or an enterprising
government, and they cannot defend their cause with suc-
cess unless it be identified with the customs of the nation
and supported by public opinion. Thus until the indepen-
dence of townships is amalgamated with the manners of a

ships of the United States rests, I have thought it expedient
to choose one of the States of New England as an example,
to examine the mechanism of its constitution, and then to
cast a general glance over the country. The township and the
county are not organized in the same manner in every part
of the Union; it is, however, easy to perceive that the same
principles have guided the formation of both of them
throughout the Union. I am inclined to believe that these
principles have been carried further in New England than
elsewhere, and consequently that they offer greater facilities
to the observations of a stranger. The institutions of New
England form a complete and regular whole; they have re-
ceived the sanction of time, they have the support of the
laws, and the still stronger support of the manners of the
community, over which they exercise the most prodigious
influence; they consequently deserve our attention on every
account.

Limits of the Township

The township of New England is a division which stands
between the commune and the canton of France, and which
corresponds in general to the English tithing, or town. Its
average population is from two to three thousand;* so that,
on the one hand, the interests of its inhabitants are not likely
to conflict, and, on the other, men capable of conducting its
affairs are always to be found among its citizens.

Authorities of the Township in New England

The people the source of all power here as elsewhere – Man-
ages its own affairs – No corporation – The greater part of
the authority vested in the hands of the Selectmen – How
the Selectmen act – Town-meeting – Enumeration of the
public officers of the township – Obligatory and remuner-
ated functions.

In the township, as well as everywhere else, the people is the
only source of power; but in no stage of government does
the body of citizens exercise a more immediate influence. In
America the people is a master whose exigencies demand
obedience to the utmost limits of possibility.
In New England the majority acts by representatives in
the conduct of the public business of the State; but if such
an arrangement be necessary in general affairs, in the town-
ships, where the legislative and administrative action of the
government is in more immediate contact with the subject,
the system of representation is not adopted. There is no cor-
poration; but the body of electors, after having designated
its magistrates, directs them in everything that exceeds the
simple and ordinary executive business of the State.*
*The same rules are not applicable to the great towns, which
generally have a mayor, and a corporation divided into two
bodies; this, however, is an exception which requires the sanc-
tion of a law. – See the Act of February 22, 1822, for ap-
pointing the authorities of the city of Boston. It frequently
happens that small towns as well as cities are subject to a
peculiar administration. In 1832, 104 townships in the State
of New York were governed in this manner. – Williams’ Reg-
ister.

*In 1830 there were 305 townships in the State of Massa-
chusetts, and 610,014 inhabitants, which gives an average
of about 2,000 inhabitants to each township.

This state of things is so contrary to our ideas, and so dif-
ferent from our customs, that it is necessary for me to ad-
duce some examples to explain it thoroughly.
The public duties in the township are extremely numer-
ous and minutely divided, as we shall see further on; but the
larger proportion of administrative power is vested in the
hands of a small number of individuals, called “the Select-
men.” *c The general laws of the State impose a certain num-
ber of obligations on the selectmen, which they may fulfil
without the authorization of the body they represent, but
which they can only neglect on their own responsibility. The
law of the State obliges them, for instance, to draw up the
list of electors in their townships; and if they omit this part
of their functions, they are guilty of a misdemeanor. In all
the affairs, however, which are determined by the town-meet-

*Three selectmen are appointed in the small townships, and
nine in the large ones. See “The Town-Officer,” p. 186. See
also the principal laws of the State of Massachusetts relative
to the selectmen:
Act of February 20, 1786, vol. i. p. 219; February 24, 1796,
vol. i. p. 488; March 7, 1801, vol. ii. p. 45; June 16, 1795,

1787, vol. i. p. 302; June 22, 1797, vol. i. p. 539.]

have only the right of presiding at the meeting.*

The selectmen are elected every year in the month of April
or of May. The town-meeting chooses at the same time a
number of other municipal magistrates, who are entrusted
with important administrative functions. The assessors rate
the township; the collectors receive the rate. A constable is
appointed to keep the peace, to watch the streets, and to
forward the execution of the laws; the town-clerk records all
the town votes, orders, grants, births, deaths, and marriages;
the treasurer keeps the funds; the overseer of the poor per-
forms the difficult task of superintending the action of the
poor-laws; committee-men are appointed to attend to the
schools and to public instruction; and the road-surveyors,
who take care of the greater and lesser thoroughfares of the
township, complete the list of the principal functionaries.
They are, however, still further subdivided; and amongst the
municipal officers are to be found parish commissioners, who
audit the expenses of public worship; different classes of in-
spectors, some of whom are to direct the citizens in case of
fire; tithing-men, listers, haywards, chimney-viewers, fence-

viewers to maintain the bounds of property, timber-measur-
ers, and sealers of weights and measures.*

There are nineteen principal officers in a township. Every
inhabitant is constrained, on the pain of being fined, to un-
dertake these different functions; which, however, are almost
all paid, in order that the poorer citizens may be able to give
up their time without loss. In general the American system
is not to grant a fixed salary to its functionaries. Every ser-
vice has its price, and they are remunerated in proportion to
what they have done.

Existence of the Township

township and the State – In France the Government lends
its agent to the Commune – In America the reverse occurs.

I have already observed that the principle of the sovereignty
of the people governs the whole political system of the Anglo-
Americans. Every page of this book will afford new instances
of the same doctrine. In the nations by which the sover-
eignty of the people is recognized every individual possesses
an equal share of power, and participates alike in the govern-
ment of the State. Every individual is, therefore, supposed to
be as well informed, as virtuous, and as strong as any of his
fellow-citizens. He obeys the government, not because he is
inferior to the authorities which conduct it, or that he is less
capable than his neighbor of governing himself, but because
he acknowledges the utility of an association with his fellow-
men, and because he knows that no such association can
exist without a regulating force. If he be a subject in all that
concerns the mutual relations of citizens, he is free and re-
sponsible to God alone for all that concerns himself. Hence
arises the maxim that every one is the best and the sole judge
of his own private interest, and that society has no right to

they have not been invested with privileges, but that they
have, on the contrary, forfeited a portion of their indepen-
dence to the State. The townships are only subordinate to
the State in those interests which I shall term social, as they
are common to all the citizens. They are independent in all
that concerns themselves; and amongst the inhabitants of
New England I believe that not a man is to be found who
would acknowledge that the State has any right to interfere
in their local interests. The towns of New England buy and
sell, sue or are sued, augment or diminish their rates, with-
out the slightest opposition on the part of the administrative
authority of the State.
They are bound, however, to comply with the demands of
the community. If the State is in need of money, a town can
neither give nor withhold the supplies. If the State projects a
road, the township cannot refuse to let it cross its territory; if
a police regulation is made by the State, it must be enforced
by the town. A uniform system of instruction is organized
all over the country, and every town is bound to establish the
schools which the law ordains. In speaking of the adminis-
tration of the United States I shall have occasion to point

out the means by which the townships are compelled to obey
in these different cases: I here merely show the existence of
the obligation. Strict as this obligation is, the government of
the State imposes it in principle only, and in its performance
the township resumes all its independent rights. Thus, taxes
are voted by the State, but they are levied and collected by
the township; the existence of a school is obligatory, but the
township builds, pays, and superintends it. In France the
State- collector receives the local imposts; in America the
town-collector receives the taxes of the State. Thus the French
Government lends its agents to the commune; in America
the township is the agent of the Government. This fact alone
shows the extent of the differences which exist between the
two nations.

Public Spirit Of The Townships Of New En-
gland

How the township of New England wins the affections of its
inhabitants – Difficulty of creating local public spirit in Eu-
rope – The rights and duties of the American township fa-

vorable to it – Characteristics of home in the United States –
Manifestations of public spirit in New England – Its happy
effects.

In America, not only do municipal bodies exist, but they are
kept alive and supported by public spirit. The township of
New England possesses two advantages which infallibly se-
cure the attentive interest of mankind, namely, independence
and authority. Its sphere is indeed small and limited, but
within that sphere its action is unrestrained; and its inde-
pendence gives to it a real importance which its extent and
population may not always ensure.
It is to be remembered that the affections of men generally
lie on the side of authority. Patriotism is not durable in a
conquered nation. The New Englander is attached to his
township, not only because he was born in it, but because it
constitutes a social body of which he is a member, and whose
government claims and deserves the exercise of his sagacity.
In Europe the absence of local public spirit is a frequent sub-
ject of regret to those who are in power; everyone agrees that
there is no surer guarantee of order and tranquility, and yet

comparison disturbs the satisfaction of the citizen: England
formerly governed the mass of the colonies, but the people
was always sovereign in the township where its rule is not
only an ancient but a primitive state.
The native of New England is attached to his township
because it is independent and free: his co-operation in its
affairs ensures his attachment to its interest; the well-being it
affords him secures his affection; and its welfare is the aim of
his ambition and of his future exertions: he takes a part in
every occurrence in the place; he practises the art of govern-
ment in the small sphere within his reach; he accustoms him-

The Counties of New England

The division of the countries in America has considerable
analogy with that of the arrondissements of France. The limits
of the counties are arbitrarily laid down, and the various dis-
tricts which they contain have no necessary connection, no
common tradition or natural sympathy; their object is sim-

ply to facilitate the administration of justice.
The extent of the township was too small to contain a
system of judicial institutions; each county has, however, a
court of justice,* a sheriff to execute its decrees, and a prison
for criminals. There are certain wants which are felt alike by
all the townships of a county; it is therefore natural that they
should be satisfied by a central authority. In the State of
Massachusetts this authority is vested in the hands of several
magistrates, who are appointed by the Governor of the State,
with the advice** of his council.*** The officers of the county
*See the Act of February 14, 1821, Laws of Massachusetts,
vol. i. p. 551.
**See the Act of February 20, 1819, Laws of Massachusetts,
vol. ii. p. 494.
***The council of the Governor is an elective body.] A two-
fold tendency may be discerned in the American constitu-
tions, which impels the legislator to centralize the legislative
and to disperse the executive power. The township of New
England has in itself an indestructible element of indepen-
dence; and this distinct existence could only be fictitiously
introduced into the county, where its utility has not been
felt. But all the townships united have but one representa-
tion, which is the State, the centre of the national authority:
beyond the action of the township and that of the nation,
nothing can be said to exist but the influence of individual
exertion.

have only a limited and occasional authority, which is appli-
cable to certain predetermined cases. The State and the town-
ships possess all the power requisite to conduct public busi-
ness. The budget of the county is drawn up by its officers,
and is voted by the legislature, but there is no assembly which
directly or indirectly represents the county. It has, therefore,
properly speaking, no political existence.

Administration in New England

Administration not perceived in America – Why? – The Eu-
ropeans believe that liberty is promoted by depriving the
social authority of some of its rights; the Americans, by di-
viding its exercise – Almost all the administration confined
to the township, and divided amongst the town-officers –
No trace of an administrative body to be perceived, either in
the township or above it – The reason of this – How it hap-
pens that the administration of the State is uniform – Who
is empowered to enforce the obedience of the township and
the county to the law – The introduction of judicial power
into the administration – Consequence of the extension of

the elective principle to all functionaries – The Justice of the
Peace in New England – By whom appointed – County of-
ficer: ensures the administration of the townships – Court
of Sessions – Its action – Right of inspection and indictment
disseminated like the other administrative functions – In-
formers encouraged by the division of fines.

Nothing is more striking to an European traveller in the
United States than the absence of what we term the Govern-
ment, or the Administration. Written laws exist in America,
and one sees that they are daily executed; but although ev-
erything is in motion, the hand which gives the impulse to
the social machine can nowhere be discovered. Nevertheless,
as all peoples are obliged to have recourse to certain gram-
matical forms, which are the foundation of human language,
in order to express their thoughts; so all communities are
obliged to secure their existence by submitting to a certain
dose of authority, without which they fall a prey to anarchy.
This authority may be distributed in several ways, but it must
always exist somewhere.
There are two methods of diminishing the force of au-

thority in a nation: The first is to weaken the supreme power

in its very principle, by forbidding or preventing society from

acting in its own defence under certain circumstances. To

weaken authority in this manner is what is generally termed

in Europe to lay the foundations of freedom. The second

manner of diminishing the influence of authority does not

consist in stripping society of any of its rights, nor in para-

lyzing its efforts, but in distributing the exercise of its privi-

leges in various hands, and in multiplying functionaries, to

each of whom the degree of power necessary for him to per-

form his duty is entrusted. There may be nations whom this

distribution of social powers might lead to anarchy; but in

itself it is not anarchical. The action of authority is indeed

thus rendered less irresistible and less perilous, but it is not

totally suppressed.

The revolution of the United States was the result of a

mature and dignified taste for freedom, and not of a vague

or ill-defined craving for independence. It contracted no al-

liance with the turbulent passions of anarchy; but its course

was marked, on the contrary, by an attachment to whatever

was lawful and orderly.

It was never assumed in the United States that the citizen

of a free country has a right to do whatever he pleases; on the

contrary, social obligations were there imposed upon him

more various than anywhere else. No idea was ever enter-

tained of attacking the principles or of contesting the rights

of society; but the exercise of its authority was divided, to

the end that the office might be powerful and the officer

insignificant, and that the community should be at once regu-

lated and free. In no country in the world does the law hold

so absolute a language as in America, and in no country is

the right of applying it vested in so many hands. The admin-

istrative power in the United States presents nothing either

central or hierarchical in its constitution, which accounts for

its passing, unperceived. The power exists, but its represen-

tative is not to be perceived.

We have already seen that the independent townships of

New England protect their own private interests; and the

municipal magistrates are the persons to whom the execu-

tion of the laws of the State is most frequently entrusted.*

Besides the general laws, the State sometimes passes general

police regulations; but more commonly the townships and

town officers, conjointly with justices of the peace, regulate
the minor details of social life, according to the necessities of
the different localities, and promulgate such enactments as
concern the health of the community, and the peace as well
as morality of the citizens.** Lastly, these municipal magis-
trates provide, of their own accord and without any delegated

powers, for those unforeseen emergencies which frequently
occur in society.*

It results from what we have said that in the State of Mas-
sachusetts the administrative authority is almost entirely re-
stricted to the township,** but that it is distributed among a
great number of individuals. In the French commune there
is properly but one official functionary, namely, the Maire;
and in New England we have seen that there are nineteen.
These nineteen functionaries do not in general depend upon
one another. The law carefully prescribes a circle of action to
each of these magistrates; and within that circle they have an
entire right to perform their functions independently of any
other authority. Above the township scarcely any trace of a
series of official dignitaries is to be found. It sometimes hap-

*See “The Town-Officer,” especially at the words Selectmen,
Assessors, Collectors, Schools, Surveyors of Highways. I take
one example in a thousand: the State prohibits travelling on
the Sunday; the tything-men, who are town-officers, are spe-
cially charged to keep watch and to execute the law. See the
Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 410.
The selectmen draw up the lists of electors for the election
of the Governor, and transmit the result of the ballot to the
Secretary of the State. See Act of February 24, 1796: Id., vol.
i. p. 488.
** Thus, for instance, the selectmen authorize the construc-
tion of drains, point out the proper sites for slaughter-houses
and other trades which are a nuisance to the neighborhood.
See the Act of June 7, 1785: Id., vol. i. p. 193.

*The selectmen take measures for the security of the public
in case of contagious diseases, conjointly with the justices of
the peace. See Act of June 22, 1797, vol. i. p. 539.
**I say almost, for there are various circumstances in the an-
nals of a township which are regulated by the justice of the
peace in his individual capacity, or by the justices of the peace
assembled in the chief town of the county; thus licenses are
granted by the justices. See the Act of February 28, 1787,
vol. i. p. 297.

pens that the county officers alter a decision of the townships
or town magistrates,* but in general the authorities of the
county have no right to interfere with the authorities of the
township,** except in such matters as concern the county.
The magistrates of the township, as well as those of the
county, are bound to communicate their acts to the central
government in a very small number of predetermined cases.***

But the central government is not represented by an indi-
vidual whose business it is to publish police regulations and
ordinances enforcing the execution of the laws; to keep up a
regular communication with the officers of the township and
the county; to inspect their conduct, to direct their actions,
or to reprimand their faults. There is no point which serves
as a centre to the radii of the administration.

Chapter V: Necessity of Examining the Condi-
tion of the States – Part II

What, then, is the uniform plan on which the government is
conducted, and how is the compliance of the counties and
their magistrates or the townships and their officers enforced?
In the States of New England the legislative authority em-
braces more subjects than it does in France; the legislator
penetrates to the very core of the administration; the law
descends to the most minute details; the same enactment
prescribes the principle and the method of its application,
and thus imposes a multitude of strict and rigorously de-
fined obligations on the secondary functionaries of the State.

*Thus licenses are only granted to such persons as can pro-
duce a certificate of good conduct from the selectmen. If the
selectmen refuse to give the certificate, the party may appeal
to the justices assembled in the Court of Sessions, and they
may grant the license. See Act of March 12, 1808, vol. ii. p.
186.
The townships have the right to make by-laws, and to en-
force them by fines which are fixed by law; but these by-laws
must be approved by the Court of Sessions. See Act of March
23, 1786, vol. i. p. 254.
**In Massachusetts the county magistrates are frequently
called upon to investigate the acts of the town magistrates;
but it will be shown further on that this investigation is a
consequence, not of their administrative, but of their judi-
cial power.
***The town committees of schools are obliged to make an
annual report to the Secretary of the State on the condition
of the school. See Act of March 10, 1827, vol. iii. p. 183.

enforcing obedience can never be vested in the same indi-
vidual, and because the power of issuing an order can never
be joined to that of inflicting a punishment or bestowing a
reward.
The communities therefore in which the secondary func-
tionaries of the government are elected are perforce obliged
to make great use of judicial penalties as a means of admin-
istration. This is not evident at first sight; for those in power
are apt to look upon the institution of elective functionaries
as one concession, and the subjection of the elected magis-
trate to the judges of the land as another. They are equally
averse to both these innovations; and as they are more press-
ingly solicited to grant the former than the latter, they ac-
cede to the election of the magistrate, and leave him inde-
pendent of the judicial power. Nevertheless, the second of
these measures is the only thing that can possibly counter-
balance the first; and it will be found that an elective author-
ity which is not subject to judicial power will, sooner or later,
either elude all control or be destroyed. The courts of justice
are the only possible medium between the central power and
the administrative bodies; they alone can compel the elected

functionary to obey, without violating the rights of the elec-
tor. The extension of judicial power in the political world
ought therefore to be in the exact ratio of the extension of
elective offices: if these two institutions do not go hand in
hand, the State must fall into anarchy or into subjection.
It has always been remarked that habits of legal business
do not render men apt to the exercise of administrative au-
thority. The Americans have borrowed from the English, their
fathers, the idea of an institution which is unknown upon
the continent of Europe: I allude to that of the Justices of
the Peace. The Justice of the Peace is a sort of mezzo termine
between the magistrate and the man of the world, between
the civil officer and the judge. A justice of the peace is a well-
informed citizen, though he is not necessarily versed in the
knowledge of the laws. His office simply obliges him to ex-
ecute the police regulations of society; a task in which good
sense and integrity are of more avail than legal science. The
justice introduces into the administration a certain taste for
established forms and publicity, which renders him a most
unserviceable instrument of despotism; and, on the other
hand, he is not blinded by those superstitions which render

legal officers unfit members of a government. The Ameri-
cans have adopted the system of the English justices of the
peace, but they have deprived it of that aristocratic character
which is discernible in the mother-country. The Governor
of Massachusetts* appoints a certain number of justices of
the peace in every county, whose functions last seven years.**
He further designates three individuals from amongst the
whole body of justices who form in each county what is called
the Court of Sessions. The justices take a personal share in
public business; they are sometimes entrusted with adminis-
trative functions in conjunction with elected officers,*** they
sometimes constitute a tribunal, before which the magistrates

*We shall hereafter learn what a Governor is: I shall content
myself with remarking in this place that he represents the
executive power of the whole State.
**See the Constitution of Massachusetts, chap. II. sect. 1.
Section 9; chap. III. Section 3.
***Thus, for example, a stranger arrives in a township from
a country where a contagious disease prevails, and he falls ill.
Two justices of the peace can, with the assent of the select-
men, order the sheriff of the county to remove and take care
of him. – Act of June 22, 1797, vol. i. p. 540.
In general the justices interfere in all the important acts of
the administration, and give them a semi-judicial character.

summarily prosecute a refractory citizen, or the citizens in-
form against the abuses of the magistrate. But it is in the
Court of Sessions that they exercise their most important
functions. This court meets twice a year in the county town;
in Massachusetts it is empowered to enforce the obedience
of the greater number* of public officers.** It must be ob-
served, that in the State of Massachusetts the Court of Ses-
sions is at the same time an administrative body, properly so
called, and a political tribunal. It has been asserted that the
county is a purely administrative division. The Court of Ses-
sions presides over that small number of affairs which, as
they concern several townships, or all the townships of the

county in common, cannot be entrusted to any one of them
in particular. *u In all that concerns county business the du-
ties of the Court of Sessions are purely administrative; and if
in its investigations it occasionally borrows the forms of ju-
dicial procedure, it is only with a view to its own informa-
tion, *v or as a guarantee to the community over which it
presides. But when the administration of the township is
brought before it, it always acts as a judicial body, and in
some few cases as an official assembly.
The first difficulty is to procure the obedience of an au-
thority as entirely independent of the general laws of the
State as the township is. We have stated that assessors are
annually named by the town-meetings to levy the taxes. If a
township attempts to evade the payment of the taxes by ne-
glecting to name its assessors, the Court of Sessions con-

*I say the greater number, because certain administrative
misdemeanors are brought before ordinary tribunals. If, for
instance, a township refuses to make the necessary expendi-
ture for its schools or to name a school-committee, it is li-
able to a heavy fine. But this penalty is pronounced by the
Supreme Judicial Court or the Court of Common Pleas. See
Act of March 10, 1827, Laws of Massachusetts, vol. iii. p.
190. Or when a township neglects to provide the necessary
war-stores. – Act of February 21, 1822: Id., vol. ii. p. 570.
**In their individual capacity the justices of the peace take a
part in the business of the counties and townships.

*These affairs may be brought under the following heads: –
1. The erection of prisons and courts of justice. 2. The county
budget, which is afterwards voted by the State. 3. The distri-
bution of the taxes so voted. 4. Grants of certain patents. 5.
The laying down and repairs of the country roads.
**Thus, when a road is under consideration, almost all diffi-
culties are disposed of by the aid of the jury.

demns it to a heavy penalty.* The fine is levied on each of
the inhabitants; and the sheriff of the county, who is the
officer of justice, executes the mandate. Thus it is that in the
United States the authority of the Government is mysteri-
ously concealed under the forms of a judicial sentence; and
its influence is at the same time fortified by that irresistible
power with which men have invested the formalities of law.
These proceedings are easy to follow and to understand.
The demands made upon a township are in general plain
and accurately defined; they consist in a simple fact without
any complication, or in a principle without its application in
detail.** But the difficulty increases when it is not the obedi-

ence of the township, but that of the town officers which is
to be enforced. All the reprehensible actions of which a pub-
lic functionary may be guilty are reducible to the following
heads:
He may execute the law without energy or zeal;
He may neglect to execute the law;
He may do what the law enjoins him not to do.

The last two violations of duty can alone come under the
cognizance of a tribunal; a positive and appreciable fact is
the indispensable foundation of an action at law. Thus, if
the selectmen omit to fulfil the legal formalities usual at town
elections, they may be condemned to pay a fine;* but when
the public officer performs his duty without ability, and when
he obeys the letter of the law without zeal or energy, he is at
least beyond the reach of judicial interference. The Court of
Sessions, even when it is invested with its official powers, is
in this case unable to compel him to a more satisfactory obe-
dience. The fear of removal is the only check to these quasi-
offences; and as the Court of Sessions does not originate the

*See Act of February 20, 1786, Laws of Massachusetts, vol.
i. p. 217.
**There is an indirect method of enforcing the obedience of
a township. Suppose that the funds which the law demands
for the maintenance of the roads have not been voted, the
town surveyor is then authorized, ex officio, to levy the sup-
plies. As he is personally responsible to private individuals
for the state of the roads, and indictable before the Court of
Sessions, he is sure to employ the extraordinary right which
the law gives him against the township. Thus by threatening
the officer the Court of Sessions exacts compliance from the
town. See Act of March 5, 1787, Id., vol. i. p. 305.
*Laws of Massachusetts, vol. ii. p. 45.

town authorities, it cannot remove functionaries whom it
does not appoint. Moreover, a perpetual investigation would
be necessary to convict the officer of negligence or
lukewarmness; and the Court of Sessions sits but twice a
year and then only judges such offences as are brought be-
fore its notice. The only security of that active and enlight-
ened obedience which a court of justice cannot impose upon
public officers lies in the possibility of their arbitrary removal.
In France this security is sought for in powers exercised by
the heads of the administration; in America it is sought for
in the principle of election.
Thus, to recapitulate in a few words what I have been show-
ing: If a public officer in New England commits a crime in
the exercise of his functions, the ordinary courts of justice
are always called upon to pass sentence upon him. If he com-
mits a fault in his official capacity, a purely administrative
tribunal is empowered to punish him; and, if the affair is
important or urgent, the judge supplies the omission of the
functionary.* Lastly, if the same individual is guilty of one of

those intangible offences of which human justice has no cog-
nizance, he annually appears before a tribunal from which
there is no appeal, which can at once reduce him to insig-
nificance and deprive him of his charge. This system un-
doubtedly possesses great advantages, but its execution is at-
tended with a practical difficulty which it is important to
point out.
I have already observed that the administrative tribunal,
which is called the Court of Sessions, has no right of inspec-
tion over the town officers. It can only interfere when the
conduct of a magistrate is specially brought under its notice;
and this is the delicate part of the system. The Americans of
New England are unacquainted with the office of public pros-
ecutor in the Court of Sessions,* and it may readily be per-
ceived that it could not have been established without diffi-
culty. If an accusing magistrate had merely been appointed
in the chief town of each county, and if he had been unas-
sisted by agents in the townships, he would not have been
better acquainted with what was going on in the county than
*If, for instance, a township persists in refusing to name its
assessors, the Court of Sessions nominates them; and the
magistrates thus appointed are invested with the same au-
thority as elected officers. See the Act quoted above, Febru-
ary 20, 1787.

*I say the Court of Sessions, because in common courts there
is a magistrate who exercises some of the functions of a pub-
lic prosecutor.

the members of the Court of Sessions. But to appoint agents
in each township would have been to centre in his person
the most formidable of powers, that of a judicial administra-
tion. Moreover, laws are the children of habit, and nothing
of the kind exists in the legislation of England. The Ameri-
cans have therefore divided the offices of inspection and of
prosecution, as well as all the other functions of the admin-
istration. Grand jurors are bound by the law to apprise the
court to which they belong of all the misdemeanors which
may have been committed in their county.* There are cer-
tain great offences which are officially prosecuted by the
States;** but more frequently the task of punishing delin-
quents devolves upon the fiscal officer, whose province it is
to receive the fine: thus the treasurer of the township is
charged with the prosecution of such administrative offences
as fall under his notice. But a more special appeal is made by
American legislation to the private interest of the citizen;***

and this great principle is constantly to be met with in study-
ing the laws of the United States. American legislators are
more apt to give men credit for intelligence than for hon-
esty, and they rely not a little on personal cupidity for the
execution of the laws. When an individual is really and sen-
sibly injured by an administrative abuse, it is natural that his
personal interest should induce him to prosecute. But if a
legal formality be required, which, however advantageous to
the community, is of small importance to individuals, plain-
tiffs may be less easily found; and thus, by a tacit agreement,
the laws may fall into disuse. Reduced by their system to this
extremity, the Americans are obliged to encourage informers
by bestowing on them a portion of the penalty in certain
cases,**** and to insure the execution of the laws by the dan-
gerous expedient of degrading the morals of the people. The
only administrative authority above the county magistrates

*The grand-jurors are, for instance, bound to inform the court of
the bad state of the roads. – Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 308.
**If, for instance, the treasurer of the county holds back his ac-
counts. – Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 406.
***Thus, if a private individual breaks down or is wounded in
consequence of the badness of a road, he can sue the township or
the county for damages at the sessions. – Laws of Massachusetts,
vol. i. p. 309.
****In cases of invasion or insurrection, if the town-officers ne-
glect to furnish the necessary stores and ammunition for the mili-
tia, the township may be condemned to a fine of from $200 to

$500. It may readily be imagined that in such a case it might
happen that no one cared to prosecute; hence the law adds that all
the citizens may indict offences of this kind, and that half of the
fine shall belong to the plaintiff. See Act of March 6, 1810, vol. ii.
p. 236. The same clause is frequently to be met with in the law of
Massachusetts. Not only are private individuals thus incited to
prosecute the public officers, but the public officers are encour-
aged in the same manner to bring the disobedience of private in-
dividuals to justice. If a citizen refuses to perform the work which
has been assigned to him upon a road, the road surveyor may
prosecute him, and he receives half the penalty for himself. See
the Laws above quoted, vol. i. p. 308.

is, properly speaking, that of the Government.

General Remarks on the Administration
of the United States

Differences of the States of the Union in their system of ad-
ministration – Activity and perfection of the local authorities
decrease towards the South – Power of the magistrate increases;
that of the elector diminishes – Administration passes from
the township to the county – States of New York, Ohio, Penn-
sylvania – Principles of administration applicable to the whole
Union – Election of public officers, and inalienability of their
functions – Absence of gradation of ranks – Introduction of
judicial resources into the administration.

I have already premised that, after having examined the con-
stitution of the township and the county of New England in
detail, I should take a general view of the remainder of the
Union. Townships and a local activity exist in every State;
but in no part of the confederation is a township to be met
with precisely similar to those of New England. The more
we descend towards the South, the less active does the busi-

ness of the township or parish become; the number of mag-
istrates, of functions, and of rights decreases; the population
exercises a less immediate influence on affairs; town meet-
ings are less frequent, and the subjects of debate less numer-
ous. The power of the elected magistrate is augmented and
that of the elector diminished, whilst the public spirit of the
local communities is less awakened and less influential.* These
differences may be perceived to a certain extent in the State
of New York; they are very sensible in Pennsylvania; but they
become less striking as we advance to the northwest. The
majority of the emigrants who settle in the northwestern
States are natives of New England, and they carry the habits

part i. chap. xi. vol. i. pp. 336-364, entitled, “Of the Powers,
Duties, and Privileges of Towns.”
See in the Digest of the Laws of Pennsylvania, the words
Assessors, Collector, Constables, Overseer of the Poor, Super-
visors of Highways; and in the Acts of a general nature of the
State of Ohio, the Act of February 25, 1834, relating to town-
ships, p. 412; besides the peculiar dispositions relating to divers
town-officers, such as Township’s Clerk, Trustees, Overseers
of the Poor, Fence Viewers, Appraisers of Property, Township’s
Treasurer, Constables, Supervisors of Highways.

of their mother country with them into that which they
adopt. A township in Ohio is by no means dissimilar from a
township in Massachusetts.
We have seen that in Massachusetts the mainspring of
public administration lies in the township. It forms the com-
mon centre of the interests and affections of the citizens.
But this ceases to be the case as we descend to States in
which knowledge is less generally diffused, and where the
township consequently offers fewer guarantees of a wise
and active administration. As we leave New England, there-
fore, we find that the importance of the town is gradually
transferred to the county, which becomes the centre of ad-
ministration, and the intermediate power between the Gov-
ernment and the citizen. In Massachusetts the business of
the county is conducted by the Court of Sessions, which is
composed of a quorum named by the Governor and his
council; but the county has no representative assembly, and
its expenditure is voted by the national legislature. In the
great State of New York, on the contrary, and in those of
Ohio and Pennsylvania, the inhabitants of each county
choose a certain number of representatives, who constitute

the assembly of the county.* The county assembly has the
right of taxing the inhabitants to a certain extent; and in this
respect it enjoys the privileges of a real legislative body: at
the same time it exercises an executive power in the county,
frequently directs the administration of the townships, and
restricts their authority within much narrower bounds than
in Massachusetts.
Such are the principal differences which the systems of
county and town administration present in the Federal States.
Were it my intention to examine the provisions of American
law minutely, I should have to point out still further differ-
ences in the executive details of the several communities.
But what I have already said may suffice to show the general
principles on which the administration of the United States
rests. These principles are differently applied; their conse-

chap. xi. vol. i. p. 340. Id. chap. xii. p. 366; also in the Acts
of the State of Ohio, an act relating to county commission-
ers, February 25, 1824, p. 263. See the Digest of the Laws of

In the State of New York each township elects a representa-

well as in that of the township.

quences are more or less numerous in various localities; but
they are always substantially the same. The laws differ, and
their outward features change, but their character does not
vary. If the township and the county are not everywhere con-
stituted in the same manner, it is at least true that in the
United States the county and the township are always based
upon the same principle, namely, that everyone is the best
judge of what concerns himself alone, and the most proper
person to supply his private wants. The township and the
county are therefore bound to take care of their special inter-
ests: the State governs, but it does not interfere with their
administration. Exceptions to this rule may be met with,
but not a contrary principle.
The first consequence of this doctrine has been to cause all
the magistrates to be chosen either by or at least from amongst
the citizens. As the officers are everywhere elected or ap-
pointed for a certain period, it has been impossible to estab-
lish the rules of a dependent series of authorities; there are
almost as many independent functionaries as there are func-
tions, and the executive power is disseminated in a multi-
tude of hands. Hence arose the indispensable necessity of

introducing the control of the courts of justice over the ad-
ministration, and the system of pecuniary penalties, by which
the secondary bodies and their representatives are constrained
to obey the laws. This system obtains from one end of the
Union to the other. The power of punishing the misconduct
of public officers, or of performing the part of the executive
in urgent cases, has not, however, been bestowed on the same
judges in all the States. The Anglo-Americans derived the
institution of justices of the peace from a common source;
but although it exists in all the States, it is not always turned
to the same use. The justices of the peace everywhere partici-
pate in the administration of the townships and the coun-
ties,* either as public officers or as the judges of public mis-
demeanors, but in most of the States the more important
classes of public offences come under the cognizance of the
ordinary tribunals.
The election of public officers, or the inalienability of their
functions, the absence of a gradation of powers, and the in-
troduction of a judicial control over the secondary branches

with all the details of the administration. See the Statutes of
the State of Tennessee, arts. Judiciary, Taxes, etc.

of the administration, are the universal characteristics of the
American system from Maine to the Floridas. In some States
(and that of New York has advanced most in this direction)
traces of a centralized administration begin to be discern-
ible. In the State of New York the officers of the central gov-
ernment exercise, in certain cases, a sort of inspection or con-
trol over the secondary bodies.*
*For instance, the direction of public instruction centres in
the hands of the Government. The legislature names the
members of the University, who are denominated Regents;
the Governor and Lieutentant-Governor of the State are nec-
essarily of the number. – Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 455. The
Regents of the University annually visit the colleges and acad-
emies, and make their report to the legislature. Their super-
intendence is not inefficient, for several reasons: the colleges
in order to become corporations stand in need of a charter,
which is only granted on the recommendation of the Re-
gents; every year funds are distributed by the State for the
encouragement of learning, and the Regents are the distribu-
tors of this money. See chap. xv. Instruction,” Revised Stat-
utes, vol. i. p. 455.
The school-commissioners are obliged to send an annual
report to the Superintendent of the Republic. – Id. p. 488.
A similar report is annually made to the same person on
the number and condition of the poor. – Id. p. 631.

At other times they constitute a court of appeal for the
decision of affairs.* In the State of New York judicial penal-
ties are less used than in other parts as a means of adminis-
tration, and the right of prosecuting the offences of public

*If any one conceives himself to be wronged by the school-
commissioners (who are town-officers), he can appeal to the
superintendent of the primary schools, whose decision is fi-
nal. – Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 487.
Provisions similar to those above cited are to be met with
from time to time in the laws of the State of New York; but
in general these attempts at centralization are weak and un-
productive. The great authorities of the State have the right
of watching and controlling the subordinate agents, without
that of rewarding or punishing them. The same individual is
never empowered to give an order and to punish disobedi-
ence; he has therefore the right of commanding, without the
means of exacting compliance. In 1830 the Superintendent
of Schools complained in his Annual Report addressed to
the legislature that several school-commissioners had ne-
glected, notwithstanding his application, to furnish him with
the accounts which were due. He added that if this omission
continued he should be obliged to prosecute them, as the
law directs, before the proper tribunals.

officers is vested in fewer hands.* The same tendency is faintly
observable in some other States;** but in general the promi-
nent feature of the administration in the United States is its
excessive local independence.

Of the State

I have described the townships and the administration; it
now remains for me to speak of the State and the Govern-
ment. This is ground I may pass over rapidly, without fear of
being misunderstood; for all I have to say is to be found in
written forms of the various constitutions, which are easily
to be procured. These constitutions rest upon a simple and
rational theory; their forms have been adopted by all consti-
tutional nations, and are become familiar to us. In this place,

therefore, it is only necessary for me to give a short analysis;
I shall endeavor afterwards to pass judgment upon what I
now describe.

Legislative Power of the State

Division of the Legislative Body into two Houses – Senate – House
of Representatives – Different functions of these two Bodies.

The legislative power of the State is vested in two assemblies,
the first of which generally bears the name of the Senate.
The Senate is commonly a legislative body; but it sometimes
becomes an executive and judicial one. It takes a part in the
government in several ways, according to the constitution of
the different States;* but it is in the nomination of public
functionaries that it most commonly assumes an executive
power. It partakes of judicial power in the trial of certain

*Thus the district-attorney is directed to recover all fines
below the sum of fifty dollars, unless such a right has been
specially awarded to another magistrate. – Revised Statutes,
vol. i. p. 383.
**Several traces of centralization may be discovered in Mas-
sachusetts; for instance, the committees of the town-schools
are directed to make an annual report to the Secretary of
State. See Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 367.
*In Massachusetts the Senate is not invested with any ad-
ministrative functions.

political offences, and sometimes also in the decision of cer-
tain civil cases.* The number of its members is always small.
The other branch of the legislature, which is usually called
the House of Representatives, has no share whatever in the
administration, and only takes a part in the judicial power
inasmuch as it impeaches public functionaries before the
Senate. The members of the two Houses are nearly every-
where subject to the same conditions of election. They are
chosen in the same manner, and by the same citizens. The
only difference which exists between them is, that the term
for which the Senate is chosen is in general longer than that
of the House of Representatives. The latter seldom remain
in office longer than a year; the former usually sit two or
three years. By granting to the senators the privilege of being
chosen for several years, and being renewed seriatim, the law
takes care to preserve in the legislative body a nucleus of
men already accustomed to public business, and capable of
exercising a salutary influence upon the junior members.
The Americans, plainly, did not desire, by this separation
of the legislative body into two branches, to make one house

*As in the State of New York.

which was introduced into the world almost by accident,
like so many other great truths – and misunderstood by sev-
eral modern nations, is at length become an axiom in the
political science of the present age.

[See Benjamin Franklin]

The Executive Power of the State

Office of Governor in an American State – The place he
occupies in relation to the Legislature – His rights and his
duties – His dependence on the people.

The executive power of the State may with truth be said to
be represented by the Governor, although he enjoys but a
portion of its rights. The supreme magistrate, under the title
of Governor, is the official moderator and counsellor of the
legislature. He is armed with a veto or suspensive power,
which allows him to stop, or at least to retard, its movements
at pleasure. He lays the wants of the country before the leg-
islative body, and points out the means which he thinks may

be usefully employed in providing for them; he is the natural
executor of its decrees in all the undertakings which interest
the nation at large.* In the absence of the legislature, the Gov-
ernor is bound to take all necessary steps to guard the State
against violent shocks and unforeseen dangers. The whole
military power of the State is at the disposal of the Governor.
He is the commander of the militia, and head of the armed
force. When the authority, which is by general consent awarded
to the laws, is disregarded, the Governor puts himself at the
head of the armed force of the State, to quell resistance, and to
restore order. Lastly, the Governor takes no share in the ad-
ministration of townships and counties, except it be indirectly
in the nomination of Justices of the Peace, which nomination
he has not the power to cancel.** The Governor is an elected
magistrate, and is generally chosen for one or two years only;
so that he always continues to be strictly dependent upon the
majority who returned him.
*Practically speaking, it is not always the Governor who ex-
ecutes the plans of the Legislature; it often happens that the
latter, in voting a measure, names special agents to superin-
tend the execution of it.
**In some of the States the justices of the peace are not elected
by the Governor.

Political Effects of the System of
Local Administration in the United States

Necessary distinction between the general centralization of
Government and the centralization of the local administra-
tion – Local administration not centralized in the United
States: great general centralization of the Government – Some
bad consequences resulting to the United States from the
local administration – Administrative advantages attending
this order of things – The power which conducts the Gov-
ernment is less regular, less enlightened, less learned, but
much greater than in Europe – Political advantages of this
order of things – In the United States the interests of the
country are everywhere kept in view – Support given to the
Government by the community – Provincial institutions
more necessary in proportion as the social condition becomes
more democratic – Reason of this.

Centralization is become a word of general and daily use,
without any precise meaning being attached to it. Neverthe-
less, there exist two distinct kinds of centralization, which it

is necessary to discriminate with accuracy. Certain interests
are common to all parts of a nation, such as the enactment
of its general laws and the maintenance of its foreign rela-
tions. Other interests are peculiar to certain parts of the na-
tion; such, for instance, as the business of different town-
ships. When the power which directs the general interests is
centred in one place, or vested in the same persons, it consti-
tutes a central government. In like manner the power of di-
recting partial or local interests, when brought together into
one place, constitutes what may be termed a central admin-
istration.
Upon some points these two kinds of centralization coa-
lesce; but by classifying the objects which fall more particu-
larly within the province of each of them, they may easily be
distinguished. It is evident that a central government acquires
immense power when united to administrative centraliza-
tion. Thus combined, it accustoms men to set their own will
habitually and completely aside; to submit, not only for once,
or upon one point, but in every respect, and at all times. Not
only, therefore, does this union of power subdue them com-
pulsorily, but it affects them in the ordinary habits of life,

and influences each individual, first separately and then col-
lectively.
These two kinds of centralization mutually assist and at-
tract each other; but they must not be supposed to be in-
separable. It is impossible to imagine a more completely cen-
tral government than that which existed in France under
Louis XIV.; when the same individual was the author and
the interpreter of the laws, and the representative of France
at home and abroad, he was justified in asserting that the
State was identified with his person. Nevertheless, the ad-
ministration was much less centralized under Louis XIV. than
it is at the present day.
In England the centralization of the government is carried
to great perfection; the State has the compact vigor of a man,
and by the sole act of its will it puts immense engines in
motion, and wields or collects the efforts of its authority.
Indeed, I cannot conceive that a nation can enjoy a secure or
prosperous existence without a powerful centralization of
government. But I am of opinion that a central administra-
tion enervates the nations in which it exists by incessantly
diminishing their public spirit. If such an administration

succeeds in condensing at a given moment, on a given point,
all the disposable resources of a people, it impairs at least the
renewal of those resources. It may ensure a victory in the
hour of strife, but it gradually relaxes the sinews of strength.
It may contribute admirably to the transient greatness of a
man, but it cannot ensure the durable prosperity of a nation.
If we pay proper attention, we shall find that whenever it
is said that a State cannot act because it has no central point,
it is the centralization of the government in which it is defi-
cient. It is frequently asserted, and we are prepared to assent
to the proposition, that the German empire was never able
to bring all its powers into action. But the reason was, that
the State was never able to enforce obedience to its general
laws, because the several members of that great body always
claimed the right, or found the means, of refusing their co-
operation to the representatives of the common authority,
even in the affairs which concerned the mass of the people;
in other words, because there was no centralization of gov-
ernment. The same remark is applicable to the Middle Ages;
the cause of all the confusion of feudal society was that the
control, not only of local but of general interests, was di-

represents that majority which claims to be the sole organ of
reason. Its own determination is, therefore, the only limit to
this action. In juxtaposition to it, and under its immediate
control, is the representative of the executive power, whose
duty it is to constrain the refractory to submit by superior
force. The only symptom of weakness lies in certain details
of the action of the Government. The American republics
have no standing armies to intimidate a discontented mi-
nority; but as no minority has as yet been reduced to declare
open war, the necessity of an army has not been felt.* The
State usually employs the officers of the township or the
county to deal with the citizens. Thus, for instance, in New
England, the assessor fixes the rate of taxes; the collector re-
ceives them; the town-treasurer transmits the amount to the
public treasury; and the disputes which may arise are brought
before the ordinary courts of justice. This method of collect-
ing taxes is slow as well as inconvenient, and it would prove
*The Civil War of 1860-65 cruelly belied this statement,
and in the course of the struggle the North alone called two
millions and a half of men to arms; but to the honor of the
United States it must be added that, with the cessation of
the contest, this army disappeared as rapidly as it had been
raised. – Translator’s Note.

its ultimate destruction.
The system of local administration produces several dif-
ferent effects in America. The Americans seem to me to have
outstepped the limits of sound policy in isolating the ad-
ministration of the Government; for order, even in second-
rate affairs, is a matter of national importance.* As the State
has no administrative functionaries of its own, stationed on
different points of its territory, to whom it can give a com-
mon impulse, the consequence is that it rarely attempts to
issue any general police regulations. The want of these regu-
lations is severely felt, and is frequently observed by Europe-
ans. The appearance of disorder which prevails on the sur-
face leads him at first to imagine that society is in a state of
*The authority which represents the State ought not, I think,
to waive the right of inspecting the local administration, even
when it does not interfere more actively. Suppose, for in-
stance, that an agent of the Government was stationed at
some appointed spot in the country, to prosecute the misde-
meanors of the town and county officers, would not a more
uniform order be the result, without in any way compromis-
ing the independence of the township? Nothing of the kind,
however, exists in America: there is nothing above the county-
courts, which have, as it were, only an incidental cognizance
of the offences they are meant to repress.

without difficulty an admirable regularity to the routine of
business; provides for the details of the social police with
sagacity; represses the smallest disorder and the most petty
misdemeanors; maintains society in a status quo alike secure
from improvement and decline; and perpetuates a drowsy
precision in the conduct of affairs, which is hailed by the
heads of the administration as a sign of perfect order and
public tranquillity: *s in short, it excels more in prevention
than in action. Its force deserts it when society is to be dis-
turbed or accelerated in its course; and if once the co-opera-
tion of private citizens is necessary to the furtherance of its
measures, the secret of its impotence is disclosed. Even whilst
it invokes their assistance, it is on the condition that they
shall act exactly as much as the Government chooses, and

*China appears to me to present the most perfect instance of
that species of well-being which a completely central admin-
istration may furnish to the nations among which it exists.
Travellers assure us that the Chinese have peace without hap-
piness, industry without improvement, stability without
strength, and public order without public morality. The con-
dition of society is always tolerable, never excellent. I am
convinced that, when China is opened to European obser-
vation, it will be found to contain the most perfect model of
a central administration which exists in the universe.

hand to interfere with all he undertakes has some difficulty
in accustoming himself to the complex mechanism of the
administration of the townships. In general it may be af-
firmed that the lesser details of the police, which render life
easy and comfortable, are neglected in America; but that the
essential guarantees of man in society are as strong there as
elsewhere. In America the power which conducts the Gov-
ernment is far less regular, less enlightened, and less learned,
but an hundredfold more authoritative than in Europe. In
no country in the world do the citizens make such exertions
for the common weal; and I am acquainted with no people
which has established schools as numerous and as efficacious,
places of public worship better suited to the wants of the
inhabitants, or roads kept in better repair. Uniformity or per-
manence of design, the minute arrangement of details,* and
the perfection of an ingenious administration, must not be
sought for in the United States; but it will be easy to find, on
the other hand, the symptoms of a power which, if it is some-
what barbarous, is at least robust; and of an existence which
is checkered with accidents indeed, but cheered at the same
time by animation and effort.
*A writer of talent, who, in the comparison which he has

drawn between the finances of France and those of the United
States, has proved that ingenuity cannot always supply the
place of a knowledge of facts, very justly reproaches the
Americans for the sort of confusion which exists in the ac-
counts of the expenditure in the townships; and after giving
the model of a departmental budget in France, he adds: –
“We are indebted to centralization, that admirable inven-
tion of a great man, for the uniform order and method which
prevail alike in all the municipal budgets, from the largest
town to the humblest commune.” Whatever may be my ad-
miration of this result, when I see the communes of France,
with their excellent system of accounts, plunged into the
grossest ignorance of their true interests, and abandoned to
so incorrigible an apathy that they seem to vegetate rather
than to live; when, on the other hand, I observe the activity,
the information, and the spirit of enterprise which keep so-
ciety in perpetual labor, in those American townships whose
budgets are drawn up with small method and with still less
uniformity, I am struck by the spectacle; for to my mind the
end of a good government is to ensure the welfare of a people,
and not to establish order and regularity in the midst of its
misery and its distress. I am therefore led to suppose that the
prosperity of the American townships and the apparent con-
fusion of their accounts, the distress of the French communes
and the perfection of their budget, may be attributable to
the same cause. At any rate I am suspicious of a benefit which
is united to so many evils, and I am not averse to an evil
which is compensated by so many benefits.

them of the event) without their knowledge; nay more, the
citizen is unconcerned as to the condition of his village, the
police of his street, the repairs of the church or of the par-
sonage; for he looks upon all these things as unconnected
with himself, and as the property of a powerful stranger whom
he calls the Government. He has only a life-interest in these
possessions, and he entertains no notions of ownership or of
improvement. This want of interest in his own affairs goes
so far that, if his own safety or that of his children is endan-
gered, instead of trying to avert the peril, he will fold his
arms, and wait till the nation comes to his assistance. This
same individual, who has so completely sacrificed his own
free will, has no natural propensity to obedience; he cowers,
it is true, before the pettiest officer; but he braves the law
with the spirit of a conquered foe as soon as its superior force
is removed: his oscillations between servitude and license are
perpetual. When a nation has arrived at this state it must
either change its customs and its laws or perish: the source of
public virtue is dry, and, though it may contain subjects, the
race of citizens is extinct. Such communities are a natural
prey to foreign conquests, and if they do not disappear from

States the interests of the country are everywhere kept in
view; they are an object of solicitude to the people of the
whole Union, and every citizen is as warmly attached to them
as if they were his own. He takes pride in the glory of his
nation; he boasts of its success, to which he conceives him-
self to have contributed, and he rejoices in the general pros-
perity by which he profits. The feeling he entertains towards
the State is analogous to that which unites him to his family,
and it is by a kind of egotism that he interests himself in the
welfare of his country.
The European generally submits to a public officer be-
cause he represents a superior force; but to an American he
represents a right. In America it may be said that no one
renders obedience to man, but to justice and to law. If the
opinion which the citizen entertains of himself is exagger-
ated, it is at least salutary; he unhesitatingly confides in his
own powers, which appear to him to be all-sufficient. When
a private individual meditates an undertaking, however di-
rectly connected it may be with the welfare of society, he
never thinks of soliciting the co-operation of the Govern-
ment, but he publishes his plan, offers to execute it himself,

courts the assistance of other individuals, and struggles man-
fully against all obstacles. Undoubtedly he is often less suc-
cessful than the State might have been in his position; but in
the end the sum of these private undertakings far exceeds all
that the Government could have done.
As the administrative authority is within the reach of the
citizens, whom it in some degree represents, it excites nei-
ther their jealousy nor their hatred; as its resources are lim-
ited, every one feels that he must not rely solely on its assis-
tance. Thus, when the administration thinks fit to interfere,
it is not abandoned to itself as in Europe; the duties of the
private citizens are not supposed to have lapsed because the
State assists in their fulfilment, but every one is ready, on the
contrary, to guide and to support it. This action of indi-
vidual exertions, joined to that of the public authorities, fre-
quently performs what the most energetic central adminis-
tration would be unable to execute. It would be easy to ad-
duce several facts in proof of what I advance, but I had rather
give only one, with which I am more thoroughly acquainted.*
In America the means which the authorities have at their

disposal for the discovery of crimes and the arrest of crimi-
nals are few. The State police does not exist, and passports
are unknown. The criminal police of the United States can-
not be compared to that of France; the magistrates and pub-
lic prosecutors are not numerous, and the examinations of
prisoners are rapid and oral. Nevertheless in no country does
crime more rarely elude punishment. The reason is, that ev-
ery one conceives himself to be interested in furnishing evi-
dence of the act committed, and in stopping the delinquent.
During my stay in the United States I witnessed the sponta-
neous formation of committees for the pursuit and prosecu-
tion of a man who had committed a great crime in a certain
county. In Europe a criminal is an unhappy being who is
struggling for his life against the ministers of justice, whilst
the population is merely a spectator of the conflict; in America
he is looked upon as an enemy of the human race, and the
whole of mankind is against him.
I believe that provincial institutions are useful to all na-
tions, but nowhere do they appear to me to be more indis-
pensable than amongst a democratic people. In an aristoc-
racy order can always be maintained in the midst of liberty,

defending that central administration which was one of the
great innovations of the Revolution?* In this manner popu-
larity may be conciliated with hostility to the rights of the
people, and the secret slave of tyranny may be the professed
admirer of freedom.
I have visited the two nations in which the system of pro-
vincial liberty has been most perfectly established, and I have
listened to the opinions of different parties in those coun-
tries. In America I met with men who secretly aspired to
destroy the democratic institutions of the Union; in England
I found others who attacked the aristocracy openly, but I
know of no one who does not regard provincial indepen-
dence as a great benefit. In both countries I have heard a
thousand different causes assigned for the evils of the State,
but the local system was never mentioned amongst them. I
have heard citizens attribute the power and prosperity of their
country to a multitude of reasons, but they all placed the
advantages of local institutions in the foremost rank. Am I
to suppose that when men who are naturally so divided on
religious opinions and on political theories agree on one point

See Appendix K.

(and that one of which they have daily experience), they are
all in error? The only nations which deny the utility of pro-
vincial liberties are those which have fewest of them; in other
words, those who are unacquainted with the institution are
the only persons who pass a censure upon it.

Judicial Power in the United States and Its Influence on
Political Society

I have thought it essential to devote a separate chapter to the
judicial authorities of the United States, lest their great po-
litical importance should be lessened in the reader’s eyes by a
merely incidental mention of them. Confederations have
existed in other countries beside America, and republics have
not been established upon the shores of the New World alone;
the representative system of government has been adopted
in several States of Europe, but I am not aware that any na-
tion of the globe has hitherto organized a judicial power on
the principle now adopted by the Americans. The judicial
organization of the United States is the institution which a
stranger has the greatest difficulty in understanding. He hears
the authority of a judge invoked in the political occurrences
of every day, and he naturally concludes that in the United
States the judges are important political functionaries; nev-
ertheless, when he examines the nature of the tribunals, they
offer nothing which is contrary to the usual habits and privi-
leges of those bodies, and the magistrates seem to him to

upon a case, he clearly steps beyond his sphere, and invades
that of the legislative authority.
The second characteristic of judicial power is that it pro-
nounces on special cases, and not upon general principles. If
a judge in deciding a particular point destroys a general prin-
ciple, by passing a judgment which tends to reject all the
inferences from that principle, and consequently to annul it,
he remains within the ordinary limits of his functions. But if
he directly attacks a general principle without having a par-
ticular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations
have agreed to confine his authority, he assumes a more im-
portant, and perhaps a more useful, influence than that of
the magistrate, but he ceases to be a representative of the
judicial power.

The third characteristic of the judicial power is its inability
to act unless it is appealed to, or until it has taken cogni-
zance of an affair. This characteristic is less general than the
other two; but, notwithstanding the exceptions, I think it
may be regarded as essential. The judicial power is by its
nature devoid of action; it must be put in motion in order to

the private citizen, but which may be altered by the will of
the people in predetermined cases, according to established
rules. In America the constitution may therefore vary, but as
long as it exists it is the origin of all authority, and the sole
vehicle of the predominating force.*

It is easy to perceive in what manner these differences must
act upon the position and the rights of the judicial bodies in
the three countries I have cited. If in France the tribunals
were authorized to disobey the laws on the ground of their
being opposed to the constitution, the supreme power would
in fact be placed in their hands, since they alone would have
the right of interpreting a constitution, the clauses of which
can be modified by no authority. They would therefore take

the place of the nation, and exercise as absolute a sway over
society as the inherent weakness of judicial power would al-
low them to do. Undoubtedly, as the French judges are in-
competent to declare a law to be unconstitutional, the power
of changing the constitution is indirectly given to the legis-
lative body, since no legal barrier would oppose the alter-
ations which it might prescribe. But it is better to grant the
power of changing the constitution of the people to men
who represent (however imperfectly) the will of the people,
than to men who represent no one but themselves.
It would be still more unreasonable to invest the English
judges with the right of resisting the decisions of the legisla-
tive body, since the Parliament which makes the laws also
makes the constitution; and consequently a law emanating
from the three powers of the State can in no case be uncon-
stitutional. But neither of these remarks is applicable to
America.
In the United States the constitution governs the legislator
as much as the private citizen; as it is the first of laws it can-
not be modified by a law, and it is therefore just that the
tribunals should obey the constitution in preference to any

*[The fifth article of the original Constitution of the United
States provides the mode in which amendments of the Con-
stitution may be made. Amendments must be proposed by
two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, and ratified by the
Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States. Fifteen
amendments of the Constitution have been made at differ-
ent times since 1789, the most important of which are the
Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, framed and ratified
after the Civil War. The original Constitution of the United
States, followed by these fifteen amendments, is printed at
the end of this edition. – Translator’s Note, 1874.]

importance of his attack is concealed from the public gaze,
his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and if
the law is slighted it is only collaterally. Moreover, although
it is censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be
diminished, but its cogency is by no means suspended, and
its final destruction can only be accomplished by the reiter-
ated attacks of judicial functionaries. It will readily be un-
derstood that by connecting the censorship of the laws with
the private interests of members of the community, and by
intimately uniting the prosecution of the law with the pros-
ecution of an individual, legislation is protected from wan-
ton assailants, and from the daily aggressions of party spirit.
The errors of the legislator are exposed whenever their evil
consequences are most felt, and it is always a positive and
appreciable fact which serves as the basis of a prosecution.
I am inclined to believe this practice of the American courts
to be at once the most favorable to liberty as well as to public
order. If the judge could only attack the legislator openly
and directly, he would sometimes be afraid to oppose any
resistance to his will; and at other moments party spirit might
encourage him to brave it at every turn. The laws would

consequently be attacked when the power from which they
emanate is weak, and obeyed when it is strong. That is to
say, when it would be useful to respect them they would be
contested, and when it would be easy to convert them into
an instrument of oppression they would be respected. But
the American judge is brought into the political arena inde-
pendently of his own will. He only judges the law because
he is obliged to judge a case. The political question which he
is called upon to resolve is connected with the interest of the
suitors, and he cannot refuse to decide it without abdicating
the duties of his post. He performs his functions as a citizen
by fulfilling the precise duties which belong to his profes-
sion as a magistrate. It is true that upon this system the judi-
cial censorship which is exercised by the courts of justice
over the legislation cannot extend to all laws indiscriminately,
inasmuch as some of them can never give rise to that exact
species of contestation which is termed a lawsuit; and even
when such a contestation is possible, it may happen that no
one cares to bring it before a court of justice. The Americans
have often felt this disadvantage, but they have left the rem-
edy incomplete, lest they should give it an efficacy which

might in some cases prove dangerous. Within these limits
the power vested in the American courts of justice of pro-
nouncing a statute to be unconstitutional forms one of the
most powerful barriers which has ever been devised against
the tyranny of political assemblies.

Other Powers Granted To American Judges

The United States all the citizens have the right of indicting
public functionaries before the ordinary tribunals – How they
use this right – Art. 75 of the French Constitution of the An
VIII – The Americans and the English cannot understand
the purport of this clause.

It is perfectly natural that in a free country like America all
the citizens should have the right of indicting public func-
tionaries before the ordinary tribunals, and that all the judges
should have the power of punishing public offences. The
right granted to the courts of justice of judging the agents of
the executive government, when they have violated the laws,
is so natural a one that it cannot be looked upon as an ex-

to perceive how much lower we are sunk than our forefa-
thers, since we allow things to pass under the color of justice
and the sanction of the law which violence alone could im-
pose upon them.

Chapter VII: Political Jurisdiction In The United
States

Chapter Summary

Definition of political jurisdiction – What is understood by
political jurisdiction in France, in England, and in the United
States – In America the political judge can only pass sen-
tence on public officers – He more frequently passes a sen-
tence of removal from office than a penalty – Political juris-
diction as it exists in the United States is, notwithstanding
its mildness, and perhaps in consequence of that mildness, a
most powerful instrument in the hands of the majority.

Political Jurisdiction In The United States

I understand, by political jurisdiction, that temporary right
of pronouncing a legal decision with which a political body
may be invested.
In absolute governments no utility can accrue from the
introduction of extraordinary forms of procedure; the prince
in whose name an offender is prosecuted is as much the sov-
ereign of the courts of justice as of everything else, and the
idea which is entertained of his power is of itself a sufficient
security. The only thing he has to fear is, that the external
formalities of justice should be neglected, and that his au-
thority should be dishonored from a wish to render it more
absolute. But in most free countries, in which the majority
can never exercise the same influence upon the tribunals as
an absolute monarch, the judicial power has occasionally been
vested for a time in the representatives of the nation. It has
been thought better to introduce a temporary confusion be-
tween the functions of the different authorities than to vio-
late the necessary principle of the unity of government.
England, France, and the United States have established

this political jurisdiction by law; and it is curious to examine
the different adaptations which these three great nations have
made of the principle. In England and in France the House
of Lords and the Chambre des Paris *a constitute the highest
criminal court of their respective nations, and although they
do not habitually try all political offences, they are compe-
tent to try them all. Another political body enjoys the right
of impeachment before the House of Lords: the only differ-
ence which exists between the two countries in this respect
is, that in England the Commons may impeach whomso-
ever they please before the Lords, whilst in France the Depu-
ties can only employ this mode of prosecution against the
ministers of the Crown.
In both countries the Upper House may make use of all
the existing penal laws of the nation to punish the delin-
quents.
In the United States, as well as in Europe, one branch of
the legislature is authorized to impeach and another to judge:
the House of Representatives arraigns the offender, and the
Senate awards his sentence. But the Senate can only try such

persons as are brought before it by the House of Representa-
tives, and those persons must belong to the class of public
functionaries. Thus the jurisdiction of the Senate is less ex-
tensive than that of the Peers of France, whilst the right of
impeachment by the Representatives is more general than
that of the Deputies. But the great difference which exists
between Europe and America is, that in Europe political tri-
bunals are empowered to inflict all the dispositions of the
penal code, while in America, when they have deprived the
offender of his official rank, and have declared him inca-
pable of filling any political office for the future, their juris-
diction terminates and that of the ordinary tribunals begins.
Suppose, for instance, that the President of the United
States has committed the crime of high treason; the House
of Representatives impeaches him, and the Senate degrades
him; he must then be tried by a jury, which alone can de-
prive him of his liberty or his life. This accurately illustrates
the subject we are treating. The political jurisdiction which
is established by the laws of Europe is intended to try great
offenders, whatever may be their birth, their rank, or their
powers in the State; and to this end all the privileges of the
*[As it existed under the constitutional monarchy down to
1848.]

courts of justice are temporarily extended to a great political
assembly. The legislator is then transformed into the magis-
trate; he is called upon to admit, to distinguish, and to pun-
ish the offence; and as he exercises all the authority of a judge,
the law restricts him to the observance of all the duties of
that high office, and of all the formalities of justice. When a
public functionary is impeached before an English or a French
political tribunal, and is found guilty, the sentence deprives
him ipso facto of his functions, and it may pronounce him
to be incapable of resuming them or any others for the fu-
ture. But in this case the political interdict is a consequence
of the sentence, and not the sentence itself. In Europe the
sentence of a political tribunal is to be regarded as a judicial
verdict rather than as an administrative measure. In the
United States the contrary takes place; and although the de-
cision of the Senate is judicial in its form, since the Senators
are obliged to comply with the practices and formalities of a
court of justice; although it is judicial in respect to the mo-
tives on which it is founded, since the Senate is in general
obliged to take an offence at common law as the basis of its
sentence; nevertheless the object of the proceeding is purely

duce. In France and in England the jurisdiction of political
bodies is looked upon as an extraordinary resource, which is
only to be employed in order to rescue society from unwonted
dangers. It is not to be denied that these tribunals, as they
are constituted in Europe, are apt to violate the conservative
principle of the balance of power in the State, and to threaten
incessantly the lives and liberties of the subject. The same
political jurisdiction in the United States is only indirectly
hostile to the balance of power; it cannot menace the lives of
the citizens, and it does not hover, as in Europe, over the
heads of the community, since those only who have submit-
ted to its authority on accepting office are exposed to the
severity of its investigations. It is at the same time less formi-
dable and less efficacious; indeed, it has not been considered
by the legislators of the United States as a remedy for the
more violent evils of society, but as an ordinary means of
conducting the government. In this respect it probably exer-
cises more real influence on the social body in America than
in Europe. We must not be misled by the apparent mildness
of the American legislation in all that relates to political ju-
risdiction. It is to be observed, in the first place, that in the

United States the tribunal which passes sentence is composed
of the same elements, and subject to the same influences, as
the body which impeaches the offender, and that this uni-
formity gives an almost irresistible impulse to the vindictive
passions of parties. If political judges in the United States
cannot inflict such heavy penalties as those of Europe, there
is the less chance of their acquitting a prisoner; and the con-
viction, if it is less formidable, is more certain. The principal
object of the political tribunals of Europe is to punish the
offender; the purpose of those in America is to deprive him
of his authority. A political condemnation in the United States
may, therefore, be looked upon as a preventive measure; and
there is no reason for restricting the judges to the exact defi-
nitions of criminal law. Nothing can be more alarming than
the excessive latitude with which political offences are de-
scribed in the laws of America. Article II., Section 4, of the
Constitution of the United States runs thus: – “The Presi-
dent, Vice-President, and all civil officers of the United States
shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and con-
viction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misde-
meanors.” Many of the Constitutions of the States are even

less explicit. “Public officers,” says the Constitution of Mas-
sachusetts,* “shall be impeached for misconduct or malad-
ministration;” the Constitution of Virginia declares that all
the civil officers who shall have offended against the State,
by maladministration, corruption, or other high crimes, may
be impeached by the House of Delegates; in some constitu-
tions no offences are specified, in order to subject the public
functionaries to an unlimited responsibility.** But I will ven-
ture to affirm that it is precisely their mildness which ren-
ders the American laws most formidable in this respect. We
have shown that in Europe the removal of a functionary and
his political interdiction are the consequences of the penalty
he is to undergo, and that in America they constitute the
penalty itself. The consequence is that in Europe political
tribunals are invested with rights which they are afraid to
use, and that the fear of punishing too much hinders them
from punishing at all. But in America no one hesitates to
inflict a penalty from which humanity does not recoil. To
condemn a political opponent to death, in order to deprive

Georgia.

ing political tribunals from inflicting judicial punishments
the Americans seem to have eluded the worst consequences
of legislative tyranny, rather than tyranny itself; and I am
not sure that political jurisdiction, as it is constituted in the
United States, is not the most formidable weapon which has
ever been placed in the rude grasp of a popular majority.
When the American republics begin to degenerate it will be
easy to verify the truth of this observation, by remarking
whether the number of political impeachments augments.*d

*See Appendix, N. [The impeachment of President Andrew
Johnson in 1868 – which was resorted to by his political
opponents solely as a means of turning him out of office, for
it could not be contended that he had been guilty of high
crimes and misdemeanors, and he was in fact honorably ac-
quitted and reinstated in office – is a striking confirmation
of the truth of this remark. – Translator’s Note, 1874.]

Chapter VIII: The Federal Constitution – Part I

I have hitherto considered each State as a separate whole,
and I have explained the different springs which the people
sets in motion, and the different means of action which it
employs. But all the States which I have considered as inde-
pendent are forced to submit, in certain cases, to the su-
preme authority of the Union. The time is now come for me
to examine separately the supremacy with which the Union
has been invested, and to cast a rapid glance over the Federal
Constitution.

Chapter Summary

Origin of the first Union – Its weakness – Congress appeals
to the constituent authority – Interval of two years between
this appeal and the promulgation of the new Constitution.

History Of The Federal Constitution

The thirteen colonies which simultaneously threw off the
yoke of England towards the end of the last century pro-
fessed, as I have already observed, the same religion, the same
language, the same customs, and almost the same laws; they
were struggling against a common enemy; and these reasons
were sufficiently strong to unite them one to another, and to
consolidate them into one nation. But as each of them had
enjoyed a separate existence and a government within its own
control, the peculiar interests and customs which resulted
from this system were opposed to a compact and intimate
union which would have absorbed the individual importance
of each in the general importance of all. Hence arose two
opposite tendencies, the one prompting the Anglo-Ameri-
cans to unite, the other to divide their strength. As long as
the war with the mother-country lasted the principle of union
was kept alive by necessity; and although the laws which
constituted it were defective, the common tie subsisted in
spite of their imperfections.* But no sooner was peace con-
*See the articles of the first confederation formed in 1778. This
constitution was not adopted by all the States until 1781. See

on the Constitution of the United States,” pp. 85-115.

cluded than the faults of the legislation became manifest,
and the State seemed to be suddenly dissolved. Each colony
became an independent republic, and assumed an absolute
sovereignty. The federal government, condemned to impo-
tence by its constitution, and no longer sustained by the pres-
ence of a common danger, witnessed the outrages offered to
its flag by the great nations of Europe, whilst it was scarcely
able to maintain its ground against the Indian tribes, and to
pay the interest of the debt which had been contracted dur-
ing the war of independence. It was already on the verge of
destruction, when it officially proclaimed its inability to con-
duct the government, and appealed to the constituent au-
thority of the nation.* If America ever approached (for how-
ever brief a time) that lofty pinnacle of glory to which the
fancy of its inhabitants is wont to point, it was at the solemn
moment at which the power of the nation abdicated, as it
were, the empire of the land. All ages have furnished the
spectacle of a people struggling with energy to win its inde-
pendence; and the efforts of the Americans in throwing off
the English yoke have been considerably exaggerated. Sepa-
rated from their enemies by three thousand miles of ocean,

the revolution to a successful issue. The assembly which ac-
cepted the task of composing the second constitution was
small;* but George Washington was its President, and it con-
tained the choicest talents and the noblest hearts which had
ever appeared in the New World. This national commission,
after long and mature deliberation, offered to the acceptance
of the people the body of general laws which still rules the
Union. All the States adopted it successively.** The new Fed-
eral Government commenced its functions in 1789, after an
interregnum of two years. The Revolution of America ter-
minated when that of France began.

Summary Of The Federal Constitution

Division of authority between the Federal Government and
the States – The Government of the States is the rule, the
Federal Government the exception.

The first question which awaited the Americans was intri-
cate, and by no means easy of solution: the object was so to
divide the authority of the different States which composed
the Union that each of them should continue to govern it-
self in all that concerned its internal prosperity, whilst the
entire nation, represented by the Union, should continue to
form a compact body, and to provide for the general exigen-
cies of the people. It was as impossible to determine before-
hand, with any degree of accuracy, the share of authority
which each of two governments was to enjoy, as to foresee all
the incidents in the existence of a nation.
The obligations and the claims of the Federal Government
were simple and easily definable, because the Union had been
formed with the express purpose of meeting the general exi-
gencies of the people; but the claims and obligations of the

*It consisted of fifty-five members; Washington, Madison,
Hamilton, and the two Morrises were amongst the number.
**It was not adopted by the legislative bodies, but represen-
tatives were elected by the people for this sole purpose; and
the new constitution was discussed at length in each of these
assemblies.

States were, on the other hand, complicated and various,
because those Governments had penetrated into all the de-
tails of social life. The attributes of the Federal Government
were therefore carefully enumerated and all that was not in-
cluded amongst them was declared to constitute a part of
the privileges of the several Governments of the States. Thus
the government of the States remained the rule, and that of
the Confederation became the exception.*
But as it was foreseen that, in practice, questions might arise
as to the exact limits of this exceptional authority, and that it
would be dangerous to submit these questions to the deci-
sion of the ordinary courts of justice, established in the States

by the States themselves, a high Federal court was created,*
which was destined, amongst other functions, to maintain
the balance of power which had been established by the
Constitution between the two rival Governments.**
*The action of this court is indirect, as we shall hereafter show.
**It is thus that “The Federalist,” No. 45, explains the division of
supremacy between the Union and the States: “The powers del-
egated by the Constitution to the Federal Government are few
and defined. Those which are to remain in the State Governments
are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised princi-
pally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign
commerce. The powers reserved to the several States will extend
to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern
the internal order and prosperity of the State.” I shall often have
occasion to quote “The Federalist” in this work. When the bill
which has since become the Constitution of the United States was
submitted to the approval of the people, and the discussions were
still pending, three men, who had already acquired a portion of
that celebrity which they have since enjoyed – John Jay, Hamilton,
and Madison – formed an association with the intention of ex-
plaining to the nation the advantages of the measure which was
proposed. With this view they published a series of articles in the
shape of a journal, which now form a complete treatise. They en-
titled their journal “The Federalist,” a name which has been re-
tained in the work. “The Federalist” is an excellent book, which
ought to be familiar to the statesmen of all countries, although it
especially concerns America.

*See the Amendment to the Federal Constitution; “Federal-
ist,” No. 32; Story, p. 711; Kent’s “Commentaries,” vol. i. p.
364.
It is to be observed that whenever the exclusive right of
regulating certain matters is not reserved to Congress by the
Constitution, the States may take up the affair until it is
brought before the National Assembly. For instance, Con-
gress has the right of making a general law on bankruptcy,
which, however, it neglects to do. Each State is then at lib-
erty to make a law for itself. This point has been established
by discussion in the law-courts, and may be said to belong
more properly to jurisprudence.

Prerogative of the Federal Government

Power of declaring war, making peace, and levying general
taxes vested in the Federal Government – What part of the
internal policy of the country it may direct – The Govern-
ment of the Union in some respects more central than the
King’s Government in the old French monarchy.

The external relations of a people may be compared to those
of private individuals, and they cannot be advantageously
maintained without the agency of a single head of a Govern-
ment. The exclusive right of making peace and war, of con-
cluding treaties of commerce, of raising armies, and equip-
ping fleets, was granted to the Union.* The necessity of a
national Government was less imperiously felt in the con-
duct of the internal policy of society; but there are certain
general interests which can only be attended to with advan-
tage by a general authority. The Union was invested with the
power of controlling the monetary system, of directing the

post office, and of opening the great roads which were to
establish a communication between the different parts of the
country.* The independence of the Government of each State
was formally recognized in its sphere; nevertheless, the Fed-
eral Government was authorized to interfere in the internal
affairs of the States** in a few predetermined cases, in which
an indiscreet abuse of their independence might compro-
mise the security of the Union at large. Thus, whilst the power
of modifying and changing their legislation at pleasure was
preserved in all the republics, they were forbidden to enact
ex post facto laws, or to create a class of nobles in their com-
munity.*** Lastly, as it was necessary that the Federal Gov-
ernment should be able to fulfil its engagements, it was en-
dowed with an unlimited power of levying taxes.****
*Several other privileges of the same kind exist, such as that
which empowers the Union to legislate on bankruptcy, to
grant patents, and other matters in which its intervention is
clearly necessary.
**Even in these cases its interference is indirect. The Union
interferes by means of the tribunals, as will be hereafter shown.

possessed, although the Union is only an assemblage of con-
federate republics.
In Spain certain provinces had the right of establishing a
system of custom-house duties peculiar to themselves, al-
though that privilege belongs, by its very nature, to the na-
tional sovereignty. In America the Congress alone has the
right of regulating the commercial relations of the States.
The government of the Confederation is therefore more cen-
tralized in this respect than the kingdom of Spain. It is true
that the power of the Crown in France or in Spain was al-
ways able to obtain by force whatever the Constitution of
the country denied, and that the ultimate result was conse-
quently the same; but I am here discussing the theory of the
Constitution.

Federal Powers

After having settled the limits within which the Federal Gov-
ernment was to act, the next point was to determine the
powers which it was to exert.

Legislative Powers*

Division of the Legislative Body into two branches – Differ-
ence in the manner of forming the two Houses – The prin-
ciple of the independence of the States predominates in the
formation of the Senate – The principle of the sovereignty of
the nation in the composition of the House of Representa-
tives – Singular effects of the fact that a Constitution can
only be logical in the early stages of a nation.

The plan which had been laid down beforehand for the
Constitutions of the several States was followed, in many
points, in the organization of the powers of the Union. The
Federal legislature of the Union was composed of a Senate
and a House of Representatives. A spirit of conciliation pre-
scribed the observance of distinct principles in the forma-
tion of these two assemblies. I have already shown that two
contrary interests were opposed to each other in the estab-
lishment of the Federal Constitution. These two interests

had given rise to two opinions. It was the wish of one party
to convert the Union into a league of independent States, or
a sort of congress, at which the representatives of the several
peoples would meet to discuss certain points of their com-
mon interests. The other party desired to unite the inhabit-
ants of the American colonies into one sole nation, and to
establish a Government which should act as the sole repre-
sentative of the nation, as far as the limited sphere of its
authority would permit. The practical consequences of these
two theories were exceedingly different.
The question was, whether a league was to be established
instead of a national Government; whether the majority of
the State, instead of the majority of the inhabitants of the
Union, was to give the law: for every State, the small as well
as the great, would then remain in the full enjoyment of its
independence, and enter the Union upon a footing of per-
fect equality. If, however, the inhabitants of the United States
were to be considered as belonging to one and the same na-
tion, it would be just that the majority of the citizens of the
Union should prescribe the law. Of course the lesser States
could not subscribe to the application of this doctrine with-
out, in fact, abdicating their existence in relation to the sov-

*In this chapter the author points out the essence of the con-
flict between the seceding States and the Union which caused
the Civil War of 1861.*

ereignty of the Confederation; since they would have passed
from the condition of a co-equal and co-legislative authority
to that of an insignificant fraction of a great people. But if
the former system would have invested them with an exces-
sive authority, the latter would have annulled their influence
altogether. Under these circumstances the result was, that
the strict rules of logic were evaded, as is usually the case
when interests are opposed to arguments. A middle course
was hit upon by the legislators, which brought together by
force two systems theoretically irreconcilable.
The principle of the independence of the States prevailed
in the formation of the Senate, and that of the sovereignty of
the nation predominated in the composition of the House
of Representatives. It was decided that each State should send
two senators to Congress, and a number of representatives
proportioned to its population.* It results from this arrange-

ment that the State of New York has at the present day forty
representatives and only two senators; the State of Delaware
has two senators and only one representative; the State of
Delaware is therefore equal to the State of New York in the
Senate, whilst the latter has forty times the influence of the
former in the House of Representatives. Thus, if the minor-
ity of the nation preponderates in the Senate,. it may para-
lyze the decisions of the majority represented in the other
House, which is contrary to the spirit of constitutional gov-
ernment.
These facts show how rare and how difficult it is rationally
and logically to combine all the several parts of legislation.
In the course of time different interests arise, and different
principles are sanctioned by the same people; and when a
general constitution is to be established, these interests and
principles are so many natural obstacles to the rigorous ap-

*Every ten years Congress fixes anew the number of representa-
tives which each State is to furnish. The total number was 69 in
1789, and 240 in 1833. (See “American Almanac,” 1834, p. 194.)
The Constitution decided that there should not be more than one
representative for every 30,000 persons; but no minimum was
fixed on. The Congress has not thought fit to augment the num-
ber of representatives in proportion to the increase of population.
The first Act which was passed on the subject (April 14, 1792: see
“Laws of the United States,” by Story, vol. i. p. 235) decided that
there should be one representative for every 33,000 inhabitants.
The last Act, which was passed in 1832, fixes the proportion at
one for 48,000. The population represented is composed of all
the free men and of three-fifths of the slaves.

The last Act of apportionment, passed February 2, 1872,
fixes the representation at one to 134,684 inhabitants. There
are now (1875) 283 members of the lower House of Con-
gress, and 9 for the States at large, making in all 292 mem-
bers. The old States have of course lost the representatives
which the new States have gained. – Translator’s Note.

that the Senate could offer but a feeble opposition to the
vote of the majority of the House of Representatives.
It must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that it was
not in the power of the American legislators to reduce to a
single nation the people for whom they were making laws.
The object of the Federal Constitution was not to destroy
the independence of the States, but to restrain it. By acknowl-
edging the real authority of these secondary communities
(and it was impossible to deprive them of it), they disavowed
beforehand the habitual use of constraint in enforcing g the
decisions of the majority. Upon this principle the introduc-
tion of the influence of the States into the mechanism of the
Federal Government was by no means to be wondered at,
since it only attested the existence of an acknowledged power,
which was to be humored and not forcibly checked.

A Further Difference between the Senate and the House
of Representatives

The Senate named by the provincial legislators, the Repre-
sentatives by the people – Double election of the former;
single election of the latter – Term of the different offices –
Peculiar functions of each House.

The Senate not only differs from the other House in the
principle which it represents, but also in the mode of its elec-
tion, in the term for which it is chosen, and in the nature of
its functions. The House of Representatives is named by the
people, the Senate by the legislators of each State; the former
is directly elected, the latter is elected by an elected body; the
term for which the representatives are chosen is only two
years, that of the senators is six. The functions of the House
of Representatives are purely legislative, and the only share it
takes in the judicial power is in the impeachment of public
officers. The Senate co-operates in the work of legislation,
and tries those political offences which the House of Repre-
sentatives submits to its decision. It also acts as the great

executive council of the nation; the treaties which are con-
cluded by the President must be ratified by the Senate, and
the appointments he may make must be definitely approved
by the same body.*

The Executive Power**

Dependence of the President – He is elective and respon-
sible – He is free to act in his own sphere under the inspec-
tion, but not under the direction, of the Senate – His salary
fixed at his entry into office – Suspensive veto.

The American legislators undertook a difficult task in at-
tempting to create an executive power dependent on the
majority of the people, and nevertheless sufficiently strong
to act without restraint in its own sphere. It was indispens-
able to the maintenance of the republican form of govern-

314; Constitution of the United States, sects. 2 and 3.

United States, art. 2; Story, p. 315, pp. 615-780; Kent’s

ment that the representative of the executive power should
be subject to the will of the nation.
The President is an elective magistrate. His honor, his prop-
erty, his liberty, and his life are the securities which the people
has for the temperate use of his power. But in the exercise of
his authority he cannot be said to be perfectly independent;
the Senate takes cognizance of his relations with foreign pow-
ers, and of the distribution of public appointments, so that
he can neither be bribed nor can he employ the means of
corruption. The legislators of the Union acknowledged that
the executive power would be incompetent to fulfil its task
with dignity and utility, unless it enjoyed a greater degree of
stability and of strength than had been granted to it in the
separate States.
The President is chosen for four years, and he may be re-
elected; so that the chances of a prolonged administration
may inspire him with hopeful undertakings for the public
good, and with the means of carrying them into execution.
The President was made the sole representative of the execu-
tive power of the Union, and care was taken not to render
his decisions subordinate to the vote of a council – a danger-

pensive veto, which allows him to oppose the passing of such
laws as might destroy the portion of independence which
the Constitution awards him. The struggle between the Presi-
dent and the legislature must always be an unequal one, since
the latter is certain of bearing down all resistance by perse-
vering in its plans; but the suspensive veto forces it at least to
reconsider the matter, and, if the motion be persisted in, it
must then be backed by a majority of two-thirds of the whole
house. The veto is, in fact, a sort of appeal to the people. The
executive power, which, without this security, might have
been secretly oppressed, adopts this means of pleading its
cause and stating its motives. But if the legislature is certain
of overpowering all resistance by persevering in its plans, I
reply, that in the constitutions of all nations, of whatever
kind they may be, a certain point exists at which the legisla-
tor is obliged to have recourse to the good sense and the
virtue of his fellow-citizens. This point is more prominent
and more discoverable in republics, whilst it is more remote
and more carefully concealed in monarchies, but it always
exists somewhere. There is no country in the world in which
everything can be provided for by the laws, or in which po-

litical institutions can prove a substitute for common sense
and public morality.

Differences between the Position of the President of the
United States and That of a Constitutional King of
France

Executive power in the Northern States as limited and as
partial as the supremacy which it represents – Executive power
in France as universal as the supremacy it represents – The
King a branch of the legislature – The President the mere
executor of the law – Other differences resulting from the
duration of the two powers – The President checked in the
exercise of the executive authority – The King independent
in its exercise – Notwithstanding these discrepancies France
is more akin to a republic than the Union to a monarchy –
Comparison of the number of public officers depending upon
the executive power in the two countries.

The executive power has so important an influence on the
destinies of nations that I am inclined to pause for an instant

necessary to look below the surface.
The sovereignty of the United States is shared between the
Union and the States, whilst in France it is undivided and
compact: hence arises the first and the most notable differ-
ence which exists between the President of the United States
and the King of France. In the United States the executive
power is as limited and partial as the sovereignty of the Union
in whose name it acts; in France it is as universal as the au-
thority of the State. The Americans have a federal and the
French a national Government.

Chapter VIII: The Federal Constitution – Part II

This cause of inferiority results from the nature of things,
but it is not the only one; the second in importance is as
follows: Sovereignty may be defined to be the right of mak-
ing laws: in France, the King really exercises a portion of the
sovereign power, since the laws have no weight till he has
given his assent to them; he is, moreover, the executor of all
they ordain. The President is also the executor of the laws,
but he does not really co-operate in their formation, since

called – the point upon which his position seems to be most
analogous to that of the King of France – the President la-
bors under several causes of inferiority. The authority of the
King, in France, has, in the first place, the advantage of du-
ration over that of the President, and durability is one of the
chief elements of strength; nothing is either loved or feared
but what is likely to endure. The President of the United
States is a magistrate elected for four years; the King, in
France, is an hereditary sovereign. In the exercise of the ex-
ecutive power the President of the United States is constantly
subject to a jealous scrutiny. He may make, but he cannot
conclude, a treaty; he may designate, but he cannot appoint,
a public officer.* The King of France is absolute within the
limits of his authority. The President of the United States is
responsible for his actions; but the person of the King is de-
clared inviolable by the French Charter.**
*The Constitution had left it doubtful whether the President
was obliged to consult the Senate in the removal as well as in
the appointment of Federal officers. “The Federalist” (No. 77)
seemed to establish the affirmative; but in 1789 Congress for-
mally decided that, as the President was responsible for his
actions, he ought not to be forced to employ agents who had
forfeited his esteem. See Kent’s “Commentaries, vol. i. p. 289.
**This comparison applied to the Constitutional King of
France and to the powers he held under the Charter of 1830,
till the overthrow of the monarchy in 1848. – Translator’s Note.

ever extensive they may be, and penetrates in a thousand
different ways into the administration of private interests.
Amongst the examples of this influence may be quoted that
which results from the great number of public functionaries,
who all derive their appointments from the Government.
This number now exceeds all previous limits; it amounts to
138,000* nominations, each of which may be considered as
an element of power. The President of the United States has
not the exclusive right of making any public appointments,
and their whole number scarcely exceeds 12,000.**

*The sums annually paid by the State to these officers amount
to 200,000,000 fr. ($40,000,000).
**This number is extracted from the “National Calendar”
for 1833. The “National Calendar” is an American almanac
which contains the names of all the Federal officers. It re-
sults from this comparison that the King of France has eleven
times as many places at his disposal as the President, although
the population of France is not much more than double that
of the Union.
I have not the means of ascertaining the number of appoint-
ments now at the disposal of the President of the United
States, but his patronage and the abuse of it have largely
increased since 1833. – Translator’s Note, 1875.

Accidental Causes Which May Increase the Influence of
the Executive Government

External security of the Union – Army of six thousand men
– Few ships – The President has no opportunity of exercis-
ing his great prerogatives – In the prerogatives he exercises
he is weak.

If the executive government is feebler in America than in
France, the cause is more attributable to the circumstances
than to the laws of the country.
It is chiefly in its foreign relations that the executive power
of a nation is called upon to exert its skill and its vigor. If the
existence of the Union were perpetually threatened, and if
its chief interests were in daily connection with those of other
powerful nations, the executive government would assume
an increased importance in proportion to the measures ex-
pected of it, and those which it would carry into effect. The
President of the United States is the commander-in-chief of
the army, but of an army composed of only six thousand
men; he commands the fleet, but the fleet reckons but few

influence would very soon become still more preponderant.
Why The President Of The United States Does Not Re-
quire The Majority Of The Two Houses In Order To Carry
On The Government It is an established axiom in Europe
that a constitutional King cannot persevere in a system of
government which is opposed by the two other branches of
the legislature. But several Presidents of the United States
have been known to lose the majority in the legislative body
without being obliged to abandon the supreme power, and
without inflicting a serious evil upon society. I have heard
this fact quoted as an instance of the independence and the
power of the executive government in America: a moment’s
reflection will convince us, on the contrary, that it is a proof
of its extreme weakness.
A King in Europe requires the support of the legislature to
enable him to perform the duties imposed upon him by the
Constitution, because those duties are enormous. A consti-
tutional King in Europe is not merely the executor of the
law, but the execution of its provisions devolves so completely
upon him that he has the power of paralyzing its influence if
it opposes his designs. He requires the assistance of the legis-

lative assemblies to make the law, but those assemblies stand
in need of his aid to execute it: these two authorities cannot
subsist without each other, and the mechanism of govern-
ment is stopped as soon as they are at variance.
In America the President cannot prevent any law from
being passed, nor can he evade the obligation of enforcing
it. His sincere and zealous co-operation is no doubt useful,
but it is not indispensable, in the carrying on of public af-
fairs. All his important acts are directly or indirectly submit-
ted to the legislature, and of his own free authority he can do
but little. It is therefore his weakness, and not his power,
which enables him to remain in opposition to Congress. In
Europe, harmony must reign between the Crown and the
other branches of the legislature, because a collision between
them may prove serious; in America, this harmony is not
indispensable, because such a collision is impossible.

Election of the President

Dangers of the elective system increase in proportion to the
extent of the prerogative – This system possible in America
because no powerful executive authority is required – What
circumstances are favorable to the elective system – Why the
election of the President does not cause a deviation from the
principles of the Government – Influence of the election of
the President on secondary functionaries.

The dangers of the system of election applied to the head of
the executive government of a great people have been suffi-
ciently exemplified by experience and by history, and the
remarks I am about to make refer to America alone. These
dangers may be more or less formidable in proportion to the
place which the executive power occupies, and to the impor-
tance it possesses in the State; and they may vary according
to the mode of election and the circumstances in which the
electors are placed. The most weighty argument against the
election of a chief magistrate is, that it offers so splendid a
lure to private ambition, and is so apt to inflame men in the

pursuit of power, that when legitimate means are wanting
force may not unfrequently seize what right denied.
It is clear that the greater the privileges of the executive
authority are, the greater is the temptation; the more the
ambition of the candidates is excited, the more warmly are
their interests espoused by a throng of partisans who hope to
share the power when their patron has won the prize. The
dangers of the elective system increase, therefore, in the ex-
act ratio of the influence exercised by the executive power in
the affairs of State. The revolutions of Poland were not solely
attributable to the elective system in general, but to the fact
that the elected monarch was the sovereign of a powerful
kingdom. Before we can discuss the absolute advantages of
the elective system we must make preliminary inquiries as to
whether the geographical position, the laws, the habits, the
manners, and the opinions of the people amongst whom it
is to be introduced will admit of the establishment of a weak
and dependent executive government; for to attempt to ren-
der the representative of the State a powerful sovereign, and
at the same time elective, is, in my opinion, to entertain two
incompatible designs. To reduce hereditary royalty to the

faction to depend upon the elevation of an individual to
power.
The great advantage of hereditary monarchies is, that as
the private interest of a family is always intimately connected
with the interests of the State, the executive government is
never suspended for a single instant; and if the affairs of a
monarchy are not better conducted than those of a republic,
at least there is always some one to conduct them, well or ill,
according to his capacity. In elective States, on the contrary,
the wheels of government cease to act, as it were, of their
own accord at the approach of an election, and even for some
time previous to that event. The laws may indeed accelerate
the operation of the election, which may be conducted with
such simplicity and rapidity that the seat of power will never
be left vacant; but, notwithstanding these precautions, a break
necessarily occurs in the minds of the people.
At the approach of an election the head of the executive
government is wholly occupied by the coming struggle; his
future plans are doubtful; he can undertake nothing new,
and the he will only prosecute with indifference those de-
signs which another will perhaps terminate. “I am so near

the time of my retirement from office,” said President
Jefferson on the 21st of January, 1809 (six weeks before the
election), “that I feel no passion, I take no part, I express no
sentiment. It appears to me just to leave to my successor the
commencement of those measures which he will have to pros-
ecute, and for which he will be responsible.”
On the other hand, the eyes of the nation are centred on a
single point; all are watching the gradual birth of so impor-
tant an event. The wider the influence of the executive power
extends, the greater and the more necessary is its constant
action, the more fatal is the term of suspense; and a nation
which is accustomed to the government, or, still more, one
used to the administrative protection of a powerful execu-
tive authority would be infallibly convulsed by an election
of this kind. In the United States the action of the Govern-
ment may be slackened with impunity, because it is always
weak and circumscribed.*
*This, however, may be a great danger. The period during
which Mr. Buchanan retained office, after the election of
Mr. Lincoln, from November, 1860, to March, 1861, was
that which enabled the seceding States of the South to com-
plete their preparations for the Civil War, and the Executive
Government was paralyzed. No greater evil could befall a
nation. -Translator’s Note.

Magistrate become. The policy of the Americans in relation
to the whole world is exceedingly simple; for it may almost
be said that no country stands in need of them, nor do they
require the co-operation of any other people. Their inde-
pendence is never threatened. In their present condition,
therefore, the functions of the executive power are no less
limited by circumstances than by the laws; and the President
may frequently change his line of policy without involving
the State in difficulty or destruction.
Whatever the prerogatives of the executive power may be,
the period which immediately precedes an election and the
moment of its duration must always be considered as a na-
tional crisis, which is perilous in proportion to the internal
embarrassments and the external dangers of the country. Few
of the nations of Europe could escape the calamities of anar-
chy or of conquest every time they might have to elect a new
sovereign. In America society is so constituted that it can
stand without assistance upon its own basis; nothing is to be
feared from the pressure of external dangers, and the elec-
tion of the President is a cause of agitation, but not of ruin.

Mode Of Election

Skill of the American legislators shown in the mode of elec-
tion adopted by them – Creation of a special electoral body
– Separate votes of these electors – Case in which the House
of Representatives is called upon to choose the President –
Results of the twelve elections which have taken place since
the Constitution has been established.

Besides the dangers which are inherent in the system, many
other difficulties may arise from the mode of election, which
may be obviated by the precaution of the legislator. When a
people met in arms on some public spot to choose its head,
it was exposed to all the chances of civil war resulting from
so martial a mode of proceeding, besides the dangers of the
elective system in itself. The Polish laws, which subjected
the election of the sovereign to the veto of a single individual,
suggested the murder of that individual or prepared the way
to anarchy.
In the examination of the institutions and the political as
well as social condition of the United States, we are struck

by the admirable harmony of the gifts of fortune and the
efforts of man. The nation possessed two of the main causes
of internal peace; it was a new country, but it was inhabited
by a people grown old in the exercise of freedom. America
had no hostile neighbors to dread; and the American legisla-
tors, profiting by these favorable circumstances, created a
weak and subordinate executive power which could without
danger be made elective.
It then only remained for them to choose the least danger-
ous of the various modes of election; and the rules which
they laid down upon this point admirably correspond to the
securities which the physical and political constitution of
the country already afforded. Their object was to find the
mode of election which would best express the choice of the
people with the least possible excitement and suspense. It
was admitted in the first place that the simple majority should
be decisive; but the difficulty was to obtain this majority
without an interval of delay which it was most important to
avoid. It rarely happens that an individual can at once col-
lect the majority of the suffrages of a great people; and this
difficulty is enhanced in a republic of confederate States,

whereas the special electors would, like a jury, remain mixed
up with the crowd till the day of action, when they would
appear for the sole purpose of giving their votes.
It was therefore established that every State should name a
certain number of electors,* who in their turn should elect
the President; and as it had been observed that the assem-
blies to which the choice of a chief magistrate had been en-
trusted in elective countries inevitably became the centres of
passion and of cabal; that they sometimes usurped an au-
thority which did not belong to them; and that their pro-
ceedings, or the uncertainty which resulted from them, were
sometimes prolonged so much as to endanger the welfare of
the State, it was determined that the electors should all vote
upon the same day, without being convoked to the same
place.** This double election rendered a majority probable,
though not certain; for it was possible that as many differ-
ences might exist between the electors as between their con-

stituents. In this case it was necessary to have recourse to one
of three measures; either to appoint new electors, or to con-
sult a second time those already appointed,or to defer the
election to another authority. The first two of these alterna-
tives, independently of the uncertainty of their results, were
likely to delay the final decision, and to perpetuate an agita-
tion which must always be accompanied with danger. The
third expedient was therefore adopted, and it was agreed that
the votes should be transmitted sealed to the President of
the Senate, and that they should be opened and counted in
the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
If none of the candidates has a majority, the House of Rep-
resentatives then proceeds immediately to elect a President,
but with the condition that it must fix upon one of the three
candidates who have the highest numbers.*
*In this case it is the majority of the States, and not the ma-
jority of the members, which decides the question; so that
New York has not more influence in the debate than Rhode
Island. Thus the citizens of the Union are first consulted as
members of one and the same community; and, if they can-
not agree, recourse is had to the division of the States, each
of which has a separate and independent vote. This is one of
the singularities of the Federal Constitution which can only
be explained by the jar of conflicting interests.

*As many as it sends members to Congress. The number of
electors at the election of 1833 was 288. (See “The National
Calendar,” 1833.)
**The electors of the same State assemble, but they transmit
to the central government the list of their individual votes,
and not the mere result of the vote of the majority.

Thus it is only in case of an event which cannot often
happen, and which can never be foreseen, that the election
is entrusted to the ordinary representatives of the nation;
and even then they are obliged to choose a citizen who has
already been designated by a powerful minority of the spe-
cial electors. It is by this happy expedient that the respect
which is due to the popular voice is combined with the ut-
most celerity of execution and those precautions which the
peace of the country demands. But the decision of the ques-
tion by the House of Representatives does not necessarily
offer an immediate solution of the difficulty, for the major-
ity of that assembly may still be doubtful, and in this case
the Constitution prescribes no remedy. Nevertheless, by re-
stricting the number of candidates to three, and by referring
the matter to the judgment of an enlightened public body, it
has smoothed all the obstacles* which are not inherent in
the elective system.
In the forty-four years which have elapsed since the pro-
mulgation of the Federal Constitution the United States have
twelve times chosen a President. Ten of these elections took

place simultaneously by the votes of the special electors in
the different States. The House of Representatives has only
twice exercised its conditional privilege of deciding in cases
of uncertainty; the first time was at the election of Mr.
Jefferson in 1801; the second was in 1825, when Mr. Quincy
Adams was named.*

Crises Of The Election

The Election may be considered as a national crisis – Why?
– Passions of the people – Anxiety of the President – Calm
which succeeds the agitation of the election.

I have shown what the circumstances are which favored the
adoption of the elective system in the United States, and
what precautions were taken by the legislators to obviate its
dangers. The Americans are habitually accustomed to all kinds
of elections, and they know by experience the utmost degree
of excitement which is compatible with security. The vast
extent of the country and the dissemination of the inhabit-

time of balloting.

the United States.

the present. As soon as the choice is determined, this ardor is
dispelled; and as a calmer season returns, the current of the
State, which had nearly broken its banks, sinks to its usual
level:* but who can refrain from astonishment at the causes
of the storm.

Chapter VIII: The Federal Constitution – Part III

Re-election Of The President

When the head of the executive power is re-eligible, it is the
State which is the source of intrigue and corruption – The
desire of being re-elected the chief aim of a President of the
United States – Disadvantage of the system peculiar to
America – The natural evil of democracy is that it subordi-
nates all authority to the slightest desires of the majority –
The re-election of the President encourages this evil.

It may be asked whether the legislators of the United States
did right or wrong in allowing the re-election of the Presi-

dent. It seems at first sight contrary to all reason to prevent
the head of the executive power from being elected a second
time. The influence which the talents and the character of a
single individual may exercise upon the fate of a whole people,
in critical circumstances or arduous times, is well known: a
law preventing the re-election of the chief magistrate would
deprive the citizens of the surest pledge of the prosperity and
the security of the commonwealth; and, by a singular incon-
sistency, a man would be excluded from the government at
the very time when he had shown his ability in conducting
its affairs.
But if these arguments are strong, perhaps still more pow-
erful reasons may be advanced against them. Intrigue and
corruption are the natural defects of elective government;
but when the head of the State can be re-elected these evils
rise to a great height, and compromise the very existence of
the country. When a simple candidate seeks to rise by in-
trigue, his manoeuvres must necessarily be limited to a nar-
row sphere; but when the chief magistrate enters the lists, he
borrows the strength of the government for his own pur-
poses. In the former case the feeble resources of an individual
*Not always. The election of President Lincoln was the sig-
nal of civil war. – Translator’s Note.

are in action; in the latter, the State itself, with all its immense
influence, is busied in the work of corruption and cabal. The
private citizen, who employs the most immoral practices to
acquire power, can only act in a manner indirectly prejudicial
to the public prosperity. But if the representative of the execu-
tive descends into the combat, the cares of government dwindle
into second-rate importance, and the success of his election is
his first concern. All laws and all the negotiations he under-
takes are to him nothing more than electioneering schemes;
places become the reward of services rendered, not to the na-
tion, but to its chief; and the influence of the government, if
not injurious to the country, is at least no longer beneficial to
the community for which it was created.
It is impossible to consider the ordinary course of affairs in
the United States without perceiving that the desire of being
re- elected is the chief aim of the President; that his whole
administration, and even his most indifferent measures, tend
to this object; and that, as the crisis approaches, his personal
interest takes the place of his interest in the public good.
The principle of re-eligibility renders the corrupt influence
of elective government still more extensive and pernicious.

In America it exercises a peculiarly fatal influence on the
sources of national existence. Every government seems to be
afflicted by some evil which is inherent in its nature, and the
genius of the legislator is shown in eluding its attacks. A State
may survive the influence of a host of bad laws, and the mis-
chief they cause is frequently exaggerated; but a law which
encourages the growth of the canker within must prove fatal
in the end, although its bad consequences may not be im-
mediately perceived.
The principle of destruction in absolute monarchies lies
in the excessive and unreasonable extension of the preroga-
tive of the crown; and a measure tending to remove the con-
stitutional provisions which counterbalance this influence
would be radically bad, even if its immediate consequences
were unattended with evil. By a parity of reasoning, in coun-
tries governed by a democracy, where the people is perpetu-
ally drawing all authority to itself, the laws which increase or
accelerate its action are the direct assailants of the very prin-
ciple of the government.
The greatest proof of the ability of the American legisla-
tors is, that they clearly discerned this truth, and that they

comes an easy tool in the hands of the majority. He adopts
its likings and its animosities, he hastens to anticipate its
wishes, he forestalls its complaints, he yields to its idlest
cravings, and instead of guiding it, as the legislature intended
that he should do, he is ever ready to follow its bidding.
Thus, in order not to deprive the State of the talents of an
individual, those talents have been rendered almost useless;
and to reserve an expedient for extraordinary perils, the coun-
try has been exposed to daily dangers.

Federal Courts*

Political importance of the judiciary in the United States -
Difficulty of treating this subject – Utility of judicial power
in confederations – What tribunals could be introduced into
the Union – Necessity of establishing federal courts of jus-
tice – Organization of the national judiciary – The Supreme
Court – In what it differs from all known tribunals.

I have inquired into the legislative and executive power of
the Union, and the judicial power now remains to be exam-
ined; but in this place I cannot conceal my fears from the
reader. Their judicial institutions exercise a great influence

*See chap. VI, entitled “Judicial Power in the United States.”
This chapter explains the general principles of the American
theory of judicial institutions. See also the Federal Constitu-
tion, Art. 3. See “The Federalists,” Nos. 78-83, inclusive;
and a work entitled “Constitutional Law,” being a view of
the practice and jurisdiction of the courts of the United States,
by Thomas Sergeant. See Story, pp. 134, 162, 489, 511, 581,
668; and the organic law of September 24, 1789, in the
“Collection of the Laws of the United States,” by Story, vol.
i. p. 53.

its power is doubled by the association of the idea of law.
A federal government stands in greater need of the sup-
port of judicial institutions than any other, because it is natu-
rally weak and exposed to formidable opposition.* If it were
always obliged to resort to violence in the first instance, it
could not fulfil its task. The Union, therefore, required a
national judiciary to enforce the obedience of the citizens to
the laws, and to repeal the attacks which might be directed
against them. The question then remained as to what tribu-
nals were to exercise these privileges; were they to be en-
trusted to the courts of justice which were already organized
in every State? or was it necessary to create federal courts? It
may easily be proved that the Union could not adapt the
judicial power of the States to its wants. The separation of
the judiciary from the administrative power of the State no

*Federal laws are those which most require courts of justice,
and those at the same time which have most rarely estab-
lished them. The reason is that confederations have usually
been formed by independent States, which entertained no
real intention of obeying the central Government, and which
very readily ceded the right of command to the federal ex-
ecutive, and very prudently reserved the right of non-com-
pliance to themselves.

named neither by the people nor the legislature, but by the
President of the United States, acting with the advice of the
Senate. In order to render them independent of the other
authorities, their office was made inalienable; and it was de-
termined that their salary, when once fixed, should not be
altered by the legislature.* It was easy to proclaim the prin-
ciple of a Federal judiciary, but difficulties multiplied when
the extent of its jurisdiction was to be determined.
*The Union was divided into districts, in each of which a resident
Federal judge was appointed, and the court in which he presided
was termed a “District Court.” Each of the judges of the Supreme
Court annually visits a certain portion of the Republic, in order to
try the most important causes upon the spot; the court presided
over by this magistrate is styled a “Circuit Court.” Lastly, all the
most serious cases of litigation are brought before the Supreme
Court, which holds a solemn session once a year, at which all the
judges of the Circuit Courts must attend. The jury was intro-
duced into the Federal Courts in the same manner, and in the
same cases, as into the courts of the States.
It will be observed that no analogy exists between the Supreme
Court of the United States and the French Cour de Cassation,
since the latter only hears appeals on questions of law. The Su-
preme Court decides upon the evidence of the fact as well as upon
the law of the case, whereas the Cour de Cassation does not pro-
nounce a decision of its own, but refers the cause to the arbitra-
tion of another tribunal. See the law of September 24, 1789, “Laws
of the United States,” by Story, vol. i. p. 53.]

Means Of Determining The Jurisdiction Of The Federal
Courts Difficulty of determining the jurisdiction of separate
courts of justice in confederations – The courts of the Union
obtained the right of fixing their own jurisdiction – In what
respect this rule attacks the portion of sovereignty reserved
to the several States – The sovereignty of these States re-
stricted by the laws, and the interpretation of the laws – Con-
sequently, the danger of the several States is more apparent
than real.

As the Constitution of the United States recognized two dis-
tinct powers in presence of each other, represented in a judi-
cial point of view by two distinct classes of courts of justice,
the utmost care which could be taken in defining their sepa-
rate jurisdictions would have been insufficient to prevent fre-
quent collisions between those tribunals. The question then
arose to whom the right of deciding the competency of each
court was to be referred.
In nations which constitute a single body politic, when a
question is debated between two courts relating to their
mutual jurisdiction, a third tribunal is generally within reach

which they were obliged to abstain as Federal tribunals. The
Supreme Court of the United States was therefore invested
with the right of determining all questions of jurisdiction.*

This was a severe blow upon the independence of the States,
which was thus restricted not only by the laws, but by the
interpretation of them; by one limit which was known, and
by another which was dubious; by a rule which was certain,
and a rule which was arbitrary. It is true the Constitution
had laid down the precise limits of the Federal supremacy,
but whenever this supremacy is contested by one of the States,
a Federal tribunal decides the question. Nevertheless, the
dangers with which the independence of the States was threat-
ened by this mode of proceeding are less serious than they

*In order to diminish the number of these suits, it was de-
cided that in a great many Federal causes the courts of the
States should be empowered to decide conjointly with those
of the Union, the losing party having then a right of appeal
to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme
Court of Virginia contested the right of the Supreme Court
of the United States to judge an appeal from its decisions,
but unsuccessfully. See “Kent’s Commentaries,” vol. i. p. 300,
pp. 370 et seq.; Story’s “Commentaries,” p. 646; and “The
Organic Law of the United States,” vol. i. p. 35.

appeared to be. We shall see hereafter that in America the
real strength of the country is vested in the provincial far
more than in the Federal Government. The Federal judges
are conscious of the relative weakness of the power in whose
name they act, and they are more inclined to abandon a right
of jurisdiction in cases where it is justly their own than to
assert a privilege to which they have no legal claim.

Different Cases Of Jurisdiction

The matter and the party are the first conditions of the Fed-
eral jurisdiction – Suits in which ambassadors are engaged –
Suits of the Union – Of a separate State – By whom tried –
Causes resulting from the laws of the Union – Why judged
by the Federal tribunals – Causes relating to the performance
of contracts tried by the Federal courts – Consequence of
this arrangement.

After having appointed the means of fixing the competency
of the Federal courts, the legislators of the Union defined
the cases which should come within their jurisdiction. It was

established, on the one hand, that certain parties must al-
ways be brought before the Federal courts, without any re-
gard to the special nature of the cause; and, on the other,
that certain causes must always be brought before the same
courts, without any regard to the quality of the parties in the
suit. These distinctions were therefore admitted to be the
basis of the Federal jurisdiction.
Ambassadors are the representatives of nations in a state of
amity with the Union, and whatever concerns these person-
ages concerns in some degree the whole Union. When an
ambassador is a party in a suit, that suit affects the welfare of
the nation, and a Federal tribunal is naturally called upon to
decide it.
The Union itself may be invoked in legal proceedings, and
in this case it would be alike contrary to the customs of all
nations and to common sense to appeal to a tribunal repre-
senting any other sovereignty than its own; the Federal courts,
therefore, take cognizance of these affairs.
When two parties belonging to two different States are
engaged in a suit, the case cannot with propriety be brought
before a court of either State. The surest expedient is to se-

lect a tribunal like that of the Union, which can excite the
suspicions of neither party, and which offers the most natu-
ral as well as the most certain remedy.
When the two parties are not private individuals, but States,
an important political consideration is added to the same
motive of equity. The quality of the parties in this case gives
a national importance to all their disputes; and the most tri-
fling litigation of the States may be said to involve the peace
of the whole Union.*

The nature of the cause frequently prescribes the rule of

competency. Thus all the questions which concern maritime
commerce evidently fall under the cognizance of the Federal
tribunals.* Almost all these questions are connected with the
interpretation of the law of nations, and in this respect they
essentially interest the Union in relation to foreign powers.
Moreover, as the sea is not included within the limits of any
peculiar jurisdiction, the national courts can only hear causes
which originate in maritime affairs.
The Constitution comprises under one head almost all the
cases which by their very nature come within the limits of
the Federal courts. The rule which it lays down is simple,
but pregnant with an entire system of ideas, and with a vast
multitude of facts. It declares that the judicial power of the
Supreme Court shall extend to all cases in law and equity
arising under the laws of the United States.
Two examples will put the intention of the legislator in
the clearest light:
The Constitution prohibits the States from making laws
on the value and circulation of money: If, notwithstanding
this prohibition, a State passes a law of this kind, with which
the interested parties refuse to comply because it is contrary

*The Constitution also says that the Federal courts shall de-
cide “controversies between a State and the citizens of an-
other State.” And here a most important question of a con-
stitutional nature arose, which was, whether the jurisdiction
given by the Constitution in cases in which a State is a party
extended to suits brought against a State as well as by it, or
was exclusively confined to the latter. The question was most
elaborately considered in the case of Chisholm v. Georgia,
and was decided by the majority of the Supreme Court in
the affirmative. The decision created general alarm among
the States, and an amendment was proposed and ratified by
which the power was entirely taken away, so far as it regards
suits brought against a State. See Story’s “Commentaries,” p.
624, or in the large edition Section 1677.
*As for instance, all cases of piracy.

to the Constitution, the case must come before a Federal
court, because it arises under the laws of the United States.
Again, if difficulties arise in the levying of import duties which
have been voted by Congress, the Federal court must decide
the case, because it arises under the interpretation of a law of
the United States.
This rule is in perfect accordance with the fundamental
principles of the Federal Constitution. The Union, as it was
established in 1789, possesses, it is true, a limited supremacy;
but it was intended that within its limits it should form one
and the same people.* Within those limits the Union is sov-
ereign. When this point is established and admitted, the in-
ference is easy; for if it be acknowledged that the United
States constitute one and the same people within the bounds
prescribed by their Constitution, it is impossible to refuse
them the rights which belong to other nations. But it has
been allowed, from the origin of society, that every nation

has the right of deciding by its own courts those questions
which concern the execution of its own laws. To this it is
answered that the Union is in so singular a position that in
relation to some matters it constitutes a people, and that in
relation to all the rest it is a nonentity. But the inference to
be drawn is, that in the laws relating to these matters the
Union possesses all the rights of absolute sovereignty. The
difficulty is to know what these matters are; and when once
it is resolved (and we have shown how it was resolved, in
speaking of the means of determining the jurisdiction of the
Federal courts) no further doubt can arise; for as soon as it is
established that a suit is Federal – that is to say, that it be-
longs to the share of sovereignty reserved by the Constitu-
tion of the Union – the natural consequence is that it should
come within the jurisdiction of a Federal court.
Whenever the laws of the United States are attacked, or
whenever they are resorted to in self-defence, the Federal
courts must be appealed to. Thus the jurisdiction of the tri-
bunals of the Union extends and narrows its limits exactly in
the same ratio as the sovereignty of the Union augments or
decreases. We have shown that the principal aim of the legis-

*This principle was in some measure restricted by the intro-
duction of the several States as independent powers into the
Senate, and by allowing them to vote separately in the House
of Representatives when the President is elected by that body.
But these are exceptions, and the contrary principle is the
rule.

hibited from making ex post facto laws in criminal cases,
and any person condemned by virtue of a law of this kind
can appeal to the judicial power of the Union. The States are
likewise prohibited from making laws which may have a ten-
dency to impair the obligations of contracts.* If a citizen
thinks that an obligation of this kind is impaired by a law
passed in his State, he may refuse to obey it, and may appeal

*It is perfectly clear, says Mr. Story (“Commentaries,” p. 503,
or in the large edition Section 1379), that any law which
enlarges, abridges, or in any manner changes the intention
of the parties, resulting from the stipulations in the contract,
necessarily impairs it. He gives in the same place a very long
and careful definition of what is understood by a contract in
Federal jurisprudence. A grant made by the State to a private
individual, and accepted by him, is a contract, and cannot
be revoked by any future law. A charter granted by the State
to a company is a contract, and equally binding to the State
as to the grantee. The clause of the Constitution here re-
ferred to insures, therefore, the existence of a great part of
acquired rights, but not of all. Property may legally be held,
though it may not have passed into the possessor’s hands by
means of a contract; and its possession is an acquired right,
not guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.

to the Federal courts.*
*A remarkable instance of this is given by Mr. Story (p. 508, or in
the large edition Section 1388): “Dartmouth College in New
Hampshire had been founded by a charter granted to certain in-
dividuals before the American Revolution, and its trustees formed
a corporation under this charter. The legislature of New Hamp-
shire had, without the consent of this corporation, passed an act
changing the organization of the original provincial charter of the
college, and transferring all the rights, privileges, and franchises
from the old charter trustees to new trustees appointed under the
act. The constitutionality of the act was contested, and, after sol-
emn arguments, it was deliberately held by the Supreme Court
that the provincial charter was a contract within the meaning of
the Constitution (Art. I. Section 10), and that the emendatory act
was utterly void, as impairing the obligation of that charter. The
college was deemed, like other colleges of private foundation, to
be a private eleemosynary institution, endowed by its charter with
a capacity to take property unconnected with the Government.
Its funds were bestowed upon the faith of the charter, and those
funds consisted entirely of private donations. It is true that the
uses were in some sense public, that is, for the general benefit, and
not for the mere benefit of the corporators; but this did not make
the corporation a public corporation. It was a private institution
for general charity. It was not distinguishable in principle from a
private donation, vested in private trustees, for a public charity, or
for a particular purpose of beneficence. And the State itself, if it
had bestowed funds upon a charity of the same nature, could not
resume those funds.”

This provision appears to me to be the most serious attack
upon the independence of the States. The rights awarded to
the Federal Government for purposes of obvious national
importance are definite and easily comprehensible; but those
with which this last clause invests it are not either clearly
appreciable or accurately defined. For there are vast num-
bers of political laws which influence the existence of obliga-
tions of contracts, which may thus furnish an easy pretext
for the aggressions of the central authority.

Chapter VIII: The Federal Constitution – Part IV

Procedure Of The Federal Courts

Natural weakness of the judiciary power in confederations -
Legislators ought to strive as much as possible to bring pri-
vate individuals, and not States, before the Federal Courts –
How the Americans have succeeded in this – Direct pros-
ecution of private individuals in the Federal Courts – Indi-
rect prosecution of the States which violate the laws of the
Union – The decrees of the Supreme Court enervate but do
not destroy the provincial laws.

I have shown what the privileges of the Federal courts are,
and it is no less important to point out the manner in which
they are exercised. The irresistible authority of justice in coun-
tries in which the sovereignty in undivided is derived from
the fact that the tribunals of those countries represent the
entire nation at issue with the individual against whom their
decree is directed, and the idea of power is thus introduced
to corroborate the idea of right. But this is not always the

been declared that the Union consisted of one and the same
people within the limits laid down by the Constitution, the
inference was that the Government created by this Consti-
tution, and acting within these limits, was invested with all
the privileges of a national government, one of the principal
of which is the right of transmitting its injunctions directly
to the private citizen. When, for instance, the Union votes
an impost, it does not apply to the States for the levying of
it, but to every American citizen in proportion to his assess-
ment. The Supreme Court, which is empowered to enforce
the execution of this law of the Union, exerts its influence
not upon a refractory State, but upon the private taxpayer;
and, like the judicial power of other nations, it is opposed to
the person of an individual. It is to be observed that the
Union chose its own antagonist; and as that antagonist is
feeble, he is naturally worsted.

But the difficulty increases when the proceedings are not
brought forward by but against the Union. The Constitu-
tion recognizes the legislative power of the States; and a law
so enacted may impair the privileges of the Union, in which

case a collision in unavoidable between that body and the
State which has passed the law: and it only remains to select
the least dangerous remedy, which is very clearly deducible
from the general principles I have before established.*

It may be conceived that, in the case under consideration,
the Union might have used the State before a Federal court,
which would have annulled the act, and by this means it
would have adopted a natural course of proceeding; but the
judicial power would have been placed in open hostility to
the State, and it was desirable to avoid this predicament as
much as possible. The Americans hold that it is nearly im-
possible that a new law should not impair the interests of
some private individual by its provisions: these private inter-
ests are assumed by the American legislators as the ground of
attack against such measures as may be prejudicial to the
Union, and it is to these cases that the protection of the Su-
preme Court is extended.
Suppose a State vends a certain portion of its territory to a
company, and that a year afterwards it passes a law by which
the territory is otherwise disposed of, and that clause of the

they engender parties in the bosom of the nation which
present powerful obstacles to the free course of justice.

High Rank of the Supreme Court Amongst the Great Powers
Of State No nation ever constituted so great a judicial power
as the Americans – Extent of its prerogative – Its political in-
fluence – The tranquillity and the very existence of the Union
depend on the discretion of the seven Federal Judges.

When we have successively examined in detail the organiza-
tion of the Supreme Court, and the entire prerogatives which
it exercises, we shall readily admit that a more imposing ju-
dicial power was never constituted by any people. The Su-
preme Court is placed at the head of all known tribunals,
both by the nature of its rights and the class of justiciable
parties which it controls.
In all the civilized countries of Europe the Government
has always shown the greatest repugnance to allow the cases
to which it was itself a party to be decided by the ordinary
course of justice. This repugnance naturally attains its ut-
most height in an absolute Government; and, on the other

*See Kent’s “Commentaries,” vol. i. p. 387.

in the authority of public opinion. They are the all- power-
ful guardians of a people which respects law, but they would
be impotent against popular neglect or popular contempt.
The force of public opinion is the most intractable of agents,
because its exact limits cannot be defined; and it is not less
dangerous to exceed than to remain below the boundary pre-
scribed.
The Federal judges must not only be good citizens, and men
possessed of that information and integrity which are indis-
pensable to magistrates, but they must be statesmen -politi-
cians, not unread in the signs of the times, not afraid to brave
the obstacles which can be subdued, nor slow to turn aside
such encroaching elements as may threaten the supremacy of
the Union and the obedience which is due to the laws.
The President, who exercises a limited power, may err with-
out causing great mischief in the State. Congress may decide
amiss without destroying the Union, because the electoral
body in which Congress originates may cause it to retract its
decision by changing its members. But if the Supreme Court
is ever composed of imprudent men or bad citizens, the Union
may be plunged into anarchy or civil war.

The real cause of this danger, however, does not lie in the
constitution of the tribunal, but in the very nature of Fed-
eral Governments. We have observed that in confederate
peoples it is especially necessary to consolidate the judicial
authority, because in no other nations do those independent
persons who are able to cope with the social body exist in
greater power or in a better condition to resist the physical
strength of the Government. But the more a power requires
to be strengthened, the more extensive and independent it
must be made; and the dangers which its abuse may create
are heightened by its independence and its strength. The
source of the evil is not, therefore, in the constitution of the
power, but in the constitution of those States which render
its existence necessary.

In What Respects the Federal Constitution Is Superior to
That of the States

In what respects the Constitution of the Union can be com-
pared to that of the States – Superiority of the Constitution
of the Union attributable to the wisdom of the Federal legis-
lators -Legislature of the Union less dependent on the people
than that of the States – Executive power more independent
in its sphere – Judicial power less subjected to the inclina-
tions of the majority – Practical consequence of these facts –
The dangers inherent in a democratic government eluded
by the Federal legislators, and increased by the legislators of
the States.

The Federal Constitution differs essentially from that of the
States in the ends which it is intended to accomplish, but in
the means by which these ends are promoted a greater anal-
ogy exists between them. The objects of the Governments
are different, but their forms are the same; and in this special
point of view there is some advantage in comparing them
together.

I am of opinion that the Federal Constitution is superior
to all the Constitutions of the States, for several reasons.
The present Constitution of the Union was formed at a later
period than those of the majority of the States, and it may
have derived some ameliorations from past experience. But
we shall be led to acknowledge that this is only a secondary
cause of its superiority, when we recollect that eleven new
States* have been added to the American Confederation since
the promulgation of the Federal Constitution, and that these
new republics have always rather exaggerated than avoided
the defects which existed in the former Constitutions.
The chief cause of the superiority of the Federal Constitu-
tion lay in the character of the legislators who composed it.
At the time when it was formed the dangers of the Confed-
eration were imminent, and its ruin seemed inevitable. In
this extremity the people chose the men who most deserved
the esteem, rather than those who had gained the affections,
of the country. I have already observed that distinguished as
almost all the legislators of the Union were for their intelli-
gence, they were still more so for their patriotism. They had

the District of Columbia.

all been nurtured at a time when the spirit of liberty was braced
by a continual struggle against a powerful and predominant
authority. When the contest was terminated, whilst the ex-
cited passions of the populace persisted in warring with dan-
gers which had ceased to threaten them, these men stopped
short in their career; they cast a calmer and more penetrating
look upon the country which was now their own; they per-
ceived that the war of independence was definitely ended, and
that the only dangers which America had to fear were those
which might result from the abuse of the freedom she had
won. They had the courage to say what they believed to be
true, because they were animated by a warm and sincere love
of liberty; and they ventured to propose restrictions, because
they were resolutely opposed to destruction.*
*At this time Alexander Hamilton, who was one of the prin-
cipal founders of the Constitution, ventured to express the
following sentiments in “The Federalist,” No. 71: -“There
are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy
of the Executive to a prevailing current, either in the com-
munity or in the Legislature, as its best recommendation.
But such men entertain very crude notions, as well of the
purposes for which government was instituted as of the true
means by which the public happiness may be promoted. The

Republican principle demands that the deliberative sense of
the community should govern the conduct of those to whom
they entrust the management of their affairs; but it does not
require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze
of passion, or to every transient impulse which the people
may receive from the arts of men who flatter their prejudices
to betray their interests. It is a just observation, that the people
commonly intend the public good. This often applies to their
very errors. But their good sense would despise the adulator
who should pretend that they always reason right about the
means of promoting it. They know from experience that they
sometimes err; and the wonder is that they so seldom err as
they do, beset, as they continually are, by the wiles of para-
sites and sycophants; by the snares of the ambitious, the ava-
ricious, the desperate; by the artifices of men who possess
their confidence more than they deserve it, and of those who
seek to possess rather than to deserve it. When occasions
present themselves in which the interests of the people are at
variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of persons whom
they have appointed to be the guardians of those interests to
withstand the temporary delusion, in order to give them time
and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection. Instances
might be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved the
people from very fatal consequences of their own mistakes,
and has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to
the men who had courage and magnanimity enough to serve
them at the peril of their displeasure.”

viz., the complete subjection of the legislative body to the
caprices of the electoral body, and the concentration of all
the powers of the Government in the legislative authority.
The growth of these evils has been encouraged by the policy
of the legislators of the States, but it has been resisted by the
legislators of the Union by every means which lay within
their control.

Characteristics Which Distinguish The Federal Constitution
Of The United States Of America From All Other Federal
Constitutions American Union appears to resemble all other
confederations – Nevertheless its effects are different – Rea-
son of this – Distinctions between the Union and all other
confederations – The American Government not a federal
but an imperfect national Government.

The United States of America do not afford either the first
or the only instance of confederate States, several of which
have existed in modern Europe, without adverting to those
of antiquity. Switzerland, the Germanic Empire, and the
Republic of the United Provinces either have been or still are

confederations. In studying the constitutions of these differ-
ent countries, the politician is surprised to observe that the
powers with which they invested the Federal Government
are nearly identical with the privileges awarded by the Ameri-
can Constitution to the Government of the United States.
They confer upon the central power the same rights of mak-
ing peace and war, of raising money and troops, and of pro-
viding for the general exigencies and the common interests
of the nation. Nevertheless the Federal Government of these
different peoples has always been as remarkable for its weak-
ness and inefficiency as that of the Union is for its vigorous
and enterprising spirit. Again, the first American Confed-
eration perished through the excessive weakness of its Gov-
ernment; and this weak Government was, notwithstanding,
in possession of rights even more extensive than those of the
Federal Government of the present day. But the more recent
Constitution of the United States contains certain principles
which exercise a most important influence, although they
do not at once strike the observer.
This Constitution, which may at first sight be confounded
with the federal constitutions which preceded it, rests upon

a novel theory, which may be considered as a great invention
in modern political science. In all the confederations which
had been formed before the American Constitution of 1789
the allied States agreed to obey the injunctions of a Federal
Government; but they reserved to themselves the right of
ordaining and enforcing the execution of the laws of the
Union. The American States which combined in 1789 agreed
that the Federal Government should not only dictate the
laws, but that it should execute it own enactments. In both
cases the right is the same, but the exercise of the right is
different; and this alteration produced the most momentous
consequences.
In all the confederations which had been formed before
the American Union the Federal Government demanded its
supplies at the hands of the separate Governments; and if
the measure it prescribed was onerous to any one of those
bodies means were found to evade its claims: if the State was
powerful, it had recourse to arms; if it was weak, it connived
at the resistance which the law of the Union, its sovereign,
met with, and resorted to inaction under the plea of inabil-
ity. Under these circumstances one of the two alternatives

has invariably occurred; either the most preponderant of the
allied peoples has assumed the privileges of the Federal au-
thority and ruled all the States in its name,* or the Federal
Government has been abandoned by its natural supporters,
anarchy has arisen between the confederates, and the Union
has lost all powers of action.**

In America the subjects of the Union are not States, but
private citizens: the national Government levies a tax, not
upon the State of Massachusetts, but upon each inhabitant
of Massachusetts. All former confederate governments pre-
sided over communities, but that of the Union rules indi-
viduals; its force is not borrowed, but self-derived; and it is
served by its own civil and military officers, by its own army,
and its own courts of justice. It cannot be doubted that the

*This was the case in Greece, when Philip undertook to ex-
ecute the decree of the Amphictyons; in the Low Countries,
where the province of Holland always gave the law; and, in
our own time, in the Germanic Confederation, in which
Austria and Prussia assume a great degree of influence over
the whole country, in the name of the Diet.
**Such has always been the situation of the Swiss Confed-
eration, which would have perished ages ago but for the
mutual jealousies of its neighbors.

which will one day designate this novel invention does not
yet exist.
The absence of this new species of confederation has been
the cause which has brought all Unions to Civil War, to sub-
jection, or to a stagnant apathy, and the peoples which formed
these leagues have been either too dull to discern, or too
pusillanimous to apply this great remedy. The American
Confederation perished by the same defects.
But the Confederate States of America had been long ac-
customed to form a portion of one empire before they had
won their independence; they had not contracted the habit
of governing themselves, and their national prejudices had
not taken deep root in their minds. Superior to the rest of
the world in political knowledge, and sharing that knowl-
edge equally amongst themselves, they were little agitated by
the passions which generally oppose the extension of federal
authority in a nation, and those passions were checked by
the wisdom of the chief citizens. The Americans applied the
remedy with prudent firmness as soon as they were conscious
of the evil; they amended their laws, and they saved their
country.

Chapter VIII: The Federal Constitution – Part V

Advantages of the Federal System in General,
and Its Special Utility in America

Happiness and freedom of small nations – Power of great
nations – Great empires favorable to the growth of civiliza-
tion – Strength often the first element of national prosperity
– Aim of the Federal system to unite the twofold advantages
resulting from a small and from a large territory – Advan-
tages derived by the United States from this system – The
law adapts itself to the exigencies of the population; popula-
tion does not conform to the exigencies of the law – Activity,
amelioration, love and enjoyment of freedom in the Ameri-
can communities – Public spirit of the Union the abstract of
provincial patriotism – Principles and things circulate freely
over the territory of the United States – The Union is happy
and free as a little nation, and respected as a great empire.

In small nations the scrutiny of society penetrates into every
part, and the spirit of improvement enters into the most tri-

tions are to be regulated at its pleasure; and the families of
the citizens as well as the affairs of the State are to be gov-
erned by its decisions. This invasion of rights occurs, how-
ever, but seldom, and freedom is in truth the natural state of
small communities. The temptations which the Government
offers to ambition are too weak, and the resources of private
individuals are too slender, for the sovereign power easily to
fall within the grasp of a single citizen; and should such an
event have occurred, the subjects of the State can without
difficulty overthrow the tyrant and his oppression by a si-
multaneous effort.
Small nations have therefore ever been the cradle of politi-
cal liberty; and the fact that many of them have lost their
immunities by extending their dominion shows that the free-
dom they enjoyed was more a consequence of the inferior
size than of the character of the people.
The history of the world affords no instance of a great
nation retaining the form of republican government for a
long series of years,* and this has led to the conclusion that
such a state of things is impracticable. For my own part, I

*I do not speak of a confederation of small republics, but of
a great consolidated Republic.

conform to the exigencies of the legislation, since the legisla-
tion cannot adapt itself to the exigencies and the customs of
the population, which is the cause of endless trouble and
misery. This disadvantage does not exist in confederations.
Congress regulates the principal measures of the national
Government, and all the details of the administration are
reserved to the provincial legislatures. It is impossible to imag-
ine how much this division of sovereignty contributes to the
well-being of each of the States which compose the Union.
In these small communities, which are never agitated by the
desire of aggrandizement or the cares of self-defence, all public
authority and private energy is employed in internal amelio-
ration. The central government of each State, which is in
immediate juxtaposition to the citizens, is daily apprised of
the wants which arise in society; and new projects are pro-
posed every year, which are discussed either at town meet-
ings or by the legislature of the State, and which are trans-
mitted by the press to stimulate the zeal and to excite the
interest of the citizens. This spirit of amelioration is con-
stantly alive in the American republics, without compromis-
ing their tranquillity; the ambition of power yields to the

insatiable desires of fame and power which have proved so
fatal to great republics. As there is no common centre to the
country, vast capital cities, colossal wealth, abject poverty,
and sudden revolutions are alike unknown; and political
passion, instead of spreading over the land like a torrent of
desolation, spends its strength against the interests and the
individual passions of every State.
Nevertheless, all commodities and ideas circulate through-
out the Union as freely as in a country inhabited by one
people. Nothing checks the spirit of enterprise. Government
avails itself of the assistance of all who have talents or knowl-
edge to serve it. Within the frontiers of the Union the
profoundest peace prevails, as within the heart of some great
empire; abroad, it ranks with the most powerful nations of
the earth; two thousand miles of coast are open to the com-
merce of the world; and as it possesses the keys of the globe,
its flags is respected in the most remote seas. The Union is as
happy and as free as a small people, and as glorious and as
strong as a great nation.

Why the Federal System Is Not Adapted to All Peoples,
and How the Anglo-Americans Were Enabled to Adopt It

Every Federal system contains defects which baffle the efforts
of the legislator – The Federal system is complex – It demands
a daily exercise of discretion on the part of the citizens – Prac-
tical knowledge of government common amongst the Ameri-
cans – Relative weakness of the Government of the Union,
another defect inherent in the Federal system – The Ameri-
cans have diminished without remedying it – The sovereignty
of the separate States apparently weaker, but really stronger,
than that of the Union – Why? – Natural causes of union
must exist between confederate peoples besides the laws – What
these causes are amongst the Anglo-Americans – Maine and
Georgia, separated by a distance of a thousand miles, more
naturally united than Normandy and Brittany – War, the main
peril of confederations – This proved even by the example of
the United States – The Union has no great wars to fear –
Why? – Dangers to which Europeans would be exposed if
they adopted the Federal system of the Americans.

When a legislator succeeds, after persevering efforts, in exer-
cising an indirect influence upon the destiny of nations, his

genius is lauded by mankind, whilst, in point of fact, the
geographical position of the country which he is unable to
change, a social condition which arose without his co-opera-
tion, manners and opinions which he cannot trace to their
source, and an origin with which he is unacquainted, exer-
cise so irresistible an influence over the courses of society
that he is himself borne away by the current, after an inef-
fectual resistance. Like the navigator, he may direct the ves-

I have shown the advantages which the Americans derive
from their federal system; it remains for me to point out the
circumstances which rendered that system practicable, as its
benefits are not to be enjoyed by all nations. The incidental
defects of the Federal system which originate in the laws may
be corrected by the skill of the legislator, but there are fur-
ther evils inherent in the system which cannot be counter-
acted by the peoples which adopt it. These nations must there-
fore find the strength necessary to support the natural im-
perfections of their Government.

they elude the numberless difficulties resulting from their
Federal Constitution. I scarcely ever met with a plain Ameri-
can citizen who could not distinguish, with surprising facil-
ity, the obligations created by the laws of Congress from those
created by the laws of his own State; and who, after having
discriminated between the matters which come under the
cognizance of the Union and those which the local legisla-
ture is competent to regulate, could not point out the exact
limit of the several jurisdictions of the Federal courts and the
tribunals of the State.
The Constitution of the United States is like those exquis-
ite productions of human industry which ensure wealth and
renown to their inventors, but which are profitless in any
other hands. This truth is exemplified by the condition of
Mexico at the present time. The Mexicans were desirous of
establishing a federal system, and they took the Federal Con-
stitution of their neighbors, the Anglo-Americans, as their
model, and copied it with considerable accuracy.* But al-
though they had borrowed the letter of the law, they were
unable to create or to introduce the spirit and the sense which

ceeded in diminishing, though not in counteracting the natu-
ral danger of confederations.
It has been remarked that the American Government does
not apply itself to the States, but that it immediately trans-
mits its injunctions to the citizens, and compels them as iso-
lated individuals to comply with its demands. But if the Fed-
eral law were to clash with the interests and the prejudices of
a State, it might be feared that all the citizens of that State
would conceive themselves to be interested in the cause of a
single individual who should refuse to obey. If all the citi-
zens of the State were aggrieved at the same time and in the
same manner by the authority of the Union, the Federal
Government would vainly attempt to subdue them individu-
ally; they would instinctively unite in a common defence,
and they would derive a ready-prepared organization from
the share of sovereignty which the institution of their State
allows them to enjoy. Fiction would give way to reality, and
an organized portion of the territory might then contest the
central authority.* The same observation holds good with

paragraph describes correctly the feelings and notions of the
South. General Lee held that his primary allegiance was due,
not to the Union, but to Virginia.

regard to the Federal jurisdiction. If the courts of the Union
violated an important law of a State in a private case, the
real, if not the apparent, contest would arise between the
aggrieved State represented by a citizen and the Union rep-
resented by its courts of justice.*

He would have but a partial knowledge of the world who
should imagine that it is possible, by the aid of legal fictions,
to prevent men from finding out and employing those means
of gratifying their passions which have been left open to them;
and it may be doubted whether the American legislators,

*For instance, the Union possesses by the Constitution the
right of selling unoccupied lands for its own profit. Suppos-
ing that the State of Ohio should claim the same right in
behalf of certain territories lying within its boundaries, upon
the plea that the Constitution refers to those lands alone
which do not belong to the jurisdiction of any particular
State, and consequently should choose to dispose of them
itself, the litigation would be carried on in the names of the
purchasers from the State of Ohio and the purchasers from
the Union, and not in the names of Ohio and the Union.
But what would become of this legal fiction if the Federal
purchaser was confirmed in his right by the courts of the
Union, whilst the other competitor was ordered to retain
possession by the tribunals of the State of Ohio?

with which it is connected, we cannot doubt of the superior-
ity of a power which is interwoven with every circumstance
that renders the love of one’s native country instinctive in
the human heart.
Since legislators are unable to obviate such dangerous col-
lisions as occur between the two sovereignties which coexist
in the federal system, their first object must be, not only to
dissuade the confederate States from warfare, but to encour-
age such institutions as may promote the maintenance of
peace. Hence it results that the Federal compact cannot be
lasting unless there exists in the communities which are
leagued together a certain number of inducements to union
which render their common dependence agreeable, and the
task of the Government light, and that system cannot suc-
ceed without the presence of favorable circumstances added
to the influence of good laws. All the peoples which have
ever formed a confederation have been held together by a
certain number of common interests, which served as the
intellectual ties of association.
But the sentiments and the principles of man must be taken
into consideration as well as his immediate interests. A certain

ence between the civilization of Maine and that of Georgia
is slighter than the difference between the habits of Normandy
and those of Brittany. Maine and Georgia, which are placed
at the opposite extremities of a great empire, are consequently
in the natural possession of more real inducements to form a
confederation than Normandy and Brittany, which are only
separated by a bridge.
The geographical position of the country contributed to
increase the facilities which the American legislators derived
from the manners and customs of the inhabitants; and it is
to this circumstance that the adoption and the maintenance
of the Federal system are mainly attributable.
The most important occurrence which can mark the an-
nals of a people is the breaking out of a war. In war a people
struggles with the energy of a single man against foreign na-
tions in the defence of its very existence. The skill of a gov-
ernment, the good sense of the community, and the natural
fondness which men entertain for their country, may suffice
to maintain peace in the interior of a district, and to favor its
internal prosperity; but a nation can only carry on a great
war at the cost of more numerous and more painful sacri-

fices; and to suppose that a great number of men will of their
own accord comply with these exigencies of the State is to
betray an ignorance of mankind. All the peoples which have
been obliged to sustain a long and serious warfare have con-
sequently been led to augment the power of their govern-
ment. Those which have not succeeded in this attempt have
been subjugated. A long war almost always places nations in
the wretched alternative of being abandoned to ruin by de-
feat or to despotism by success. War therefore renders the
symptoms of the weakness of a government most palpable
and most alarming; and I have shown that the inherent de-
feat of federal governments is that of being weak.
The Federal system is not only deficient in every kind of
centralized administration, but the central government itself
is imperfectly organized, which is invariably an influential
cause of inferiority when the nation is opposed to other coun-
tries which are themselves governed by a single authority. In
the Federal Constitution of the United States, by which the
central government possesses more real force, this evil is still
extremely sensible. An example will illustrate the case to the
reader.

both States; and the Federal Government was constrained to
raise elsewhere the troops which it required.*

The only safeguard which the American Union, with all
the relative perfection of its laws, possesses against the disso-
lution which would be produced by a great war, lies in its
probable exemption from that calamity. Placed in the centre
of an immense continent, which offers a boundless field for
human industry, the Union is almost as much insulated from
the world as if its frontiers were girt by the ocean. Canada

*Kent’s “Commentaries,” vol. i. p. 244. I have selected an
example which relates to a time posterior to the promulga-
tion of the present Constitution. If I had gone back to the
days of the Confederation, I might have given still more strik-
ing instances. The whole nation was at that time in a state of
enthusiastic excitement; the Revolution was represented by
a man who was the idol of the people; but at that very period
Congress had, to say the truth, no resources at all at its dis-
posal. Troops and supplies were perpetually wanting. The
best-devised projects failed in the execution, and the Union,
which was constantly on the verge of destruction, was saved
by the weakness of its enemies far more than by its own
strength. [All doubt as to the powers of the Federal Execu-
tive was, however, removed by its efforts in the Civil War,
and those powers were largely extended.

contains only a million of inhabitants, and its population is
divided into two inimical nations. The rigor of the climate
limits the extension of its territory, and shuts up its ports
during the six months of winter. From Canada to the Gulf
of Mexico a few savage tribes are to be met with, which re-
tire, perishing in their retreat, before six thousand soldiers.
To the South, the Union has a point of contact with the
empire of Mexico; and it is thence that serious hostilities
may one day be expected to arise. But for a long while to
come the uncivilized state of the Mexican community, the
depravity of its morals, and its extreme poverty, will prevent
that country from ranking high amongst nations.* As for
the Powers of Europe, they are too distant to be formidable.
The great advantage of the United States does not, then,
consist in a Federal Constitution which allows them to carry
on great wars, but in a geographical position which renders
such enterprises extremely improbable.
No one can be more inclined than I am myself to appreci-
ate the advantages of the federal system, which I hold to be

one of the combinations most favorable to the prosperity
and freedom of man. I envy the lot of those nations which
have been enabled to adopt it; but I cannot believe that any
confederate peoples could maintain a long or an equal con-
test with a nation of similar strength in which the govern-
ment should be centralized. A people which should divide
its sovereignty into fractional powers, in the presence of the
great military monarchies of Europe, would, in my opinion,
by that very act, abdicate its power, and perhaps its existence
and its name. But such is the admirable position of the New
World that man has no other enemy than himself; and that,
in order to be happy and to be free, it suffices to seek the
gifts of prosperity and the knowledge of freedom.

*War broke out between the United States and Mexico in
1846, and ended in the conquest of an immense territory,
including California.

Chapter XI: Why the People May Strictly Be
Said to Govern in the United States

I have hitherto examined the institutions of the United States;
I have passed their legislation in review, and I have depicted
the present characteristics of political society in that coun-
try. But a sovereign power exists above these institutions and
beyond these characteristic features which may destroy or
modify them at its pleasure – I mean that of the people. It
remains to be shown in what manner this power, which regu-
lates the laws, acts: its propensities and its passions remain to
be pointed out, as well as the secret springs which retard,
accelerate, or direct its irresistible course; and the effects of
its unbounded authority, with the destiny which is probably
reserved for it.

Chapter X: Why The People May Strictly Be Said To
Govern In The United States

In America the people appoints the legislative and the ex-
ecutive power, and furnishes the jurors who punish all of-

fences against the laws. The American institutions are demo-
cratic, not only in their principle but in all their consequences;
and the people elects its representatives directly, and for the
most part annually, in order to ensure their dependence. The
people is therefore the real directing power; and although
the form of government is representative, it is evident that
the opinions, the prejudices, the interests, and even the pas-
sions of the community are hindered by no durable obstacles
from exercising a perpetual influence on society. In the United
States the majority governs in the name of the people, as is
the case in all the countries in which the people is supreme.
The majority is principally composed of peaceful citizens
who, either by inclination or by interest, are sincerely desir-
ous of the welfare of their country. But they are surrounded
by the incessant agitation of parties, which attempt to gain
their co-operation and to avail themselves of their support.

Parties In The United States

A great distinction must be made between parties. Some
countries are so large that the different populations which
inhabit them have contradictory interests, although they are
the subjects of the same Government, and they may thence
be in a perpetual state of opposition. In this case the differ-
ent fractions of the people may more properly be considered
as distinct nations than as mere parties; and if a civil war

breaks out, the struggle is carried on by rival peoples rather
than by factions in the State.
But when the citizens entertain different opinions upon
subjects which affect the whole country alike, such, for in-
stance, as the principles upon which the government is to be
conducted, then distinctions arise which may correctly be
styled parties. Parties are a necessary evil in free governments;
but they have not at all times the same character and the
same propensities.
At certain periods a nation may be oppressed by such in-
supportable evils as to conceive the design of effecting a total
change in its political constitution; at other times the mis-
chief lies still deeper, and the existence of society itself is
endangered. Such are the times of great revolutions and of
great parties. But between these epochs of misery and of con-
fusion there are periods during which human society seems
to rest, and mankind to make a pause. This pause is, indeed,
only apparent, for time does not stop its course for nations
any more than for men; they are all advancing towards a
goal with which they are unacquainted; and we only imag-
ine them to be stationary when their progress escapes our

conflict of these two opinions never assumed that degree of
violence in America which it has frequently displayed else-
where. Both parties of the Americans were, in fact, agreed
upon the most essential points; and neither of them had to
destroy a traditionary constitution, or to overthrow the struc-
ture of society, in order to ensure its own triumph. In nei-
ther of them, consequently, were a great number of private
interests affected by success or by defeat; but moral prin-
ciples of a high order, such as the love of equality and of
independence, were concerned in the struggle, and they suf-
ficed to kindle violent passions.
The party which desired to limit the power of the people
endeavored to apply its doctrines more especially to the Con-
stitution of the Union, whence it derived its name of Fed-
eral. The other party, which affected to be more exclusively
attached to the cause of liberty, took that of Republican.
America is a land of democracy, and the Federalists were al-
ways in a minority; but they reckoned on their side almost
all the great men who had been called forth by the War of
Independence, and their moral influence was very consider-
able. Their cause was, moreover, favored by circumstances.
The ruin of the Confederation had impressed the people
with a dread of anarchy, and the Federalists did not fail to

profit by this transient disposition of the multitude. For ten
or twelve years they were at the head of affairs, and they were
able to apply some, though not all, of their principles; for
the hostile current was becoming from day to day too vio-
lent to be checked or stemmed. In 1801 the Republicans got
possession of the Government; Thomas Jefferson was named
President; and he increased the influence of their party by
the weight of his celebrity, the greatness of his talents, and
the immense extent of his popularity.
The means by which the Federalists had maintained their
position were artificial, and their resources were temporary;
it was by the virtues or the talents of their leaders that they
had risen to power. When the Republicans attained to that
lofty station, their opponents were overwhelmed by utter
defeat. An immense majority declared itself against the retir-
ing party, and the Federalists found themselves in so small a
minority that they at once despaired of their future success.
From that moment the Republican or Democratic party*
has proceeded from conquest to conquest, until it has ac-

the signification of these terms has changed. The Republi-
cans are the representatives of the old Federalists, and the
Democrats of the old Republicans. – Trans. Note (1861).

quired absolute supremacy in the country. The Federalists,
perceiving that they were vanquished without resource, and
isolated in the midst of the nation, fell into two divisions, of
which one joined the victorious Republicans, and the other
abandoned its rallying-point and its name. Many years have
already elapsed since they ceased to exist as a party.
The accession of the Federalists to power was, in my opin-
ion, one of the most fortunate incidents which accompa-
nied the formation of the great American Union; they re-
sisted the inevitable propensities of their age and of the coun-
try. But whether their theories were good or bad, they had
the effect of being inapplicable, as a system, to the society
which they professed to govern, and that which occurred
under the auspices of Jefferson must therefore have taken
place sooner or later. But their Government gave the new
republic time to acquire a certain stability, and afterwards to
support the rapid growth of the very doctrines which they
had combated. A considerable number of their principles
were in point of fact embodied in the political creed of their
opponents; and the Federal Constitution which subsists at
the present day is a lasting monument of their patriotism

and their wisdom.
Great political parties are not, then, to be met with in the
United States at the present time. Parties, indeed, may be found
which threaten the future tranquillity of the Union; but there
are none which seem to contest the present form of Govern-
ment or the present course of society. The parties by which
the Union is menaced do not rest upon abstract principles,
but upon temporal interests. These interests, disseminated in
the provinces of so vast an empire, may be said to constitute
rival nations rather than parties. Thus, upon a recent occa-
sion, the North contended for the system of commercial pro-
hibition, and the South took up arms in favor of free trade,
simply because the North is a manufacturing and the South
an agricultural district; and that the restrictive system which
was profitable to the one was prejudicial to the other.*

In the absence of great parties, the United States abound
with lesser controversies; and public opinion is divided into
a thousand minute shades of difference upon questions of

greater degree of intensity, and the South, though conquered,
still presents a formidable spirit of opposition to Northern
government. – Translator’s Note, 1875.

very little moment. The pains which are taken to create par-
ties are inconceivable, and at the present day it is no easy
task. In the United States there is no religious animosity,
because all religion is respected, and no sect is predominant;
there is no jealousy of rank, because the people is everything,
and none can contest its authority; lastly, there is no public
indigence to supply the means of agitation, because the physi-
cal position of the country opens so wide a field to industry
that man is able to accomplish the most surprising under-
takings with his own native resources. Nevertheless, ambi-
tious men are interbsted in the creation of parties, since it is
difficult to eject a person from authority upon the mere
ground that his place is coveted by others. The skill of the
actors in the political world lies therefore in the art of creat-
ing parties. A political aspirant in the United States begins
by discriminating his own interest, and by calculating upon
those interests which may be collected around and amal-
gamated with it; he then contrives to discover some doctrine
or some principle which may suit the purposes of this new
association, and which he adopts in order to bring forward
his party and to secure his popularity; just as the imprimatur

tion, they are the main point and the very soul of every fac-
tion in the United States.
To quote a recent example. When the President attacked
the Bank, the country was excited and parties were formed;
the well-informed classes rallied round the Bank, the com-
mon people round the President. But it must not be imag-
ined that the people had formed a rational opinion upon a
question which offers so many difficulties to the most expe-
rienced statesmen. The Bank is a great establishment which
enjoys an independent existence, and the people, accustomed
to make and unmake whatsoever it pleases, is startled to meet
with this obstacle to its authority. In the midst of the per-
petual fluctuation of society the community is irritated by
so permanent an institution, and is led to attack it in order
to see whether it can be shaken and controlled, like all the
other institutions of the country.

Remains of the Aristocratic Party in the United States

Secret opposition of wealthy individuals to democracy – Their
retirement – Their taste for exclusive pleasures and for luxury

at home – Their simplicity abroad – Their affected conde-
scension towards the people.

It sometimes happens in a people amongst which various opin-
ions prevail that the balance of the several parties is lost, and
one of them obtains an irresistible preponderance, overpow-
ers all obstacles, harasses its opponents, and appropriates all
the resources of society to its own purposes. The vanquished
citizens despair of success and they conceal their dissatisfac-
tion in silence and in general apathy. The nation seems to be
governed by a single principle, and the prevailing party as-
sumes the credit of having restored peace and unanimity to
the country. But this apparent unanimity is merely a cloak to
alarming dissensions and perpetual opposition.
This is precisely what occurred in America; when the demo-
cratic party got the upper hand, it took exclusive possession
of the conduct of affairs, and from that time the laws and
the customs of society have been adapted to its caprices. At
the present day the more affluent classes of society are so
entirely removed from the direction of political affairs in the
United States that wealth, far from conferring a right to the

his pleasures, or more jealous of the smallest advantages which
his privileged station confers upon him. But the very same
individual crosses the city to reach a dark counting-house in
the centre of traffic, where every one may accost him who
pleases. If he meets his cobbler upon the way, they stop and
converse; the two citizens discuss the affairs of the State in
which they have an equal interest, and they shake hands be-
fore they part.
But beneath this artificial enthusiasm, and these obsequi-
ous attentions to the preponderating power, it is easy to per-
ceive that the wealthy members of the community entertain
a hearty distaste to the democratic institutions of their coun-
try. The populace is at once the object of their scorn and of
their fears. If the maladministration of the democracy ever
brings about a revolutionary crisis, and if monarchical insti-
tutions ever become practicable in the United States, the truth
of what I advance will become obvious.
The two chief weapons which parties use in order to en-
sure success are the public press and the formation of asso-
ciations.

Liberty Of The Press In The United States

The influence of the liberty of the press does not affect politi-
cal opinions alone, but it extends to all the opinions of men,
and it modifies customs as well as laws. In another part of this
work I shall attempt to determinate the degree of influence

tained the following article:
In all this affair the language of Jackson has been that of a
heartless despot, solely occupied with the preservation of his
own authority. Ambition is his crime, and it will be his pun-
ishment too: intrigue is his native element, and intrigue will
confound his tricks, and will deprive him of his power: he
governs by means of corruption, and his immoral practices
will redound to his shame and confusion. His conduct in
the political arena has been that of a shameless and lawless
gamester. He succeeded at the time, but the hour of retribu-
tion approaches, and he will be obliged to disgorge his win-
nings, to throw aside his false dice, and to end his days in
some retirement, where he may curse his madness at his lei-
sure; for repentance is a virtue with which his heart is likely
to remain forever unacquainted.
It is not uncommonly imagined in France that the viru-
lence of the press originates in the uncertain social condi-
tion, in the political excitement, and the general sense of
consequent evil which prevail in that country; and it is there-
fore supposed that as soon as society has resumed a certain
degree of composure the press will abandon its present vehe-

for its organs are far from numerous. The influence of a public
press thus constituted, upon a sceptical nation, must be un-
bounded. It is an enemy with which a Government may sign
an occasional truce, but which it is difficult to resist for any
length of time.
Neither of these kinds of centralization exists in America.
The United States have no metropolis; the intelligence as
well as the power of the country are dispersed abroad, and
instead of radiating from a point, they cross each other in
every direction; the Americans have established no central
control over the expression of opinion, any more than over
the conduct of business. These are circumstances which do
not depend on human foresight; but it is owing to the laws
of the Union that there are no licenses to be granted to print-
ers, no securities demanded from editors as in France, and
no stamp duty as in France and formerly in England. The
consequence of this is that nothing is easier than to set up a
newspaper, and a small number of readers suffices to defray
the expenses of the editor.
The number of periodical and occasional publications
which appears in the United States actually surpasses belief.

under his own standard. All the political journals of the
United States are indeed arrayed on the side of the adminis-
tration or against it; but they attack and defend in a thou-
sand different ways. They cannot succeed in forming those
great currents of opinion which overwhelm the most solid
obstacles. This division of the influence of the press pro-
duces a variety of other consequences which are scarcely less
remarkable. The facility with which journals can be estab-
lished induces a multitude of individuals to take a part in
them; but as the extent of competition precludes the possi-
bility of considerable profit, the most distinguished classes
of society are rarely led to engage in these undertakings. But
such is the number of the public prints that, even if they
were a source of wealth, writers of ability could not be found
to direct them all. The journalists of the United States are
usually placed in a very humble position, with a scanty edu-
cation and a vulgar turn of mind. The will of the majority is
the most general of laws, and it establishes certain habits
which form the characteristics of each peculiar class of soci-
ety; thus it dictates the etiquette practised at courts and the
etiquette of the bar. The characteristics of the French jour-

nalist consist in a violent, but frequently an eloquent and
lofty, manner of discussing the politics of the day; and the
exceptions to this habitual practice are only occasional. The
characteristics of the American journalist consist in an open
and coarse appeal to the passions of the populace; and he
habitually abandons the principles of political science to as-
sail the characters of individuals, to track them into private
life, and disclose all their weaknesses and errors.
Nothing can be more deplorable than this abuse of the
powers of thought; I shall have occasion to point out hereaf-
ter the influence of the newspapers upon the taste and the
morality of the American people, but my present subject ex-
clusively concerns the political world. It cannot be denied
that the effects of this extreme license of the press tend indi-
rectly to the maintenance of public order. The individuals
who are already in the possession of a high station in the
esteem of their fellow-citizens are afraid to write in the news-
papers, and they are thus deprived of the most powerful in-
strument which they can use to excite the passions of the
multitude to their own advantage.*
*They only write in the papers when they choose to address
the people in their own name; as, for instance, when they are
called upon to repel calumnious imputations, and to correct
a misstatement of facts.

The personal opinions of the editors have no kind of weight
in the eyes of the public: the only use of a journal is, that it
imparts the knowledge of certain facts, and it is only by al-
tering or distorting those facts that a journalist can contrib-
ute to the support of his own views.
But although the press is limited to these resources, its in-
fluence in America is immense. It is the power which impels
the circulation of political life through all the districts of that
vast territory. Its eye is constantly open to detect the secret
springs of political designs, and to summon the leaders of all
parties to the bar of public opinion. It rallies the interests of
the community round certain principles, and it draws up the
creed which factions adopt; for it affords a means of inter-
course between parties which hear, and which address each
other without ever having been in immediate contact. When
a great number of the organs of the press adopt the same line
of conduct, their influence becomes irresistible; and public
opinion, when it is perpetually assailed from the same side,
eventually yields to the attack. In the United States each sepa-
rate journal exercises but little authority, but the power of the
periodical press is only second to that of the people.*
*See Appendix, P.

The opinions established in the United States under the
empire of the liberty of the press are frequently more firmly
rooted than those which are formed elsewhere under the sanc-
tion of a censor.
In the United States the democracy perpetually raises fresh
individuals to the conduct of public affairs; and the mea-
sures of the administration are consequently seldom regu-
lated by the strict rules of consistency or of order. But the
general principles of the Government are more stable, and
the opinions most prevalent in society are generally more
durable than in many other countries. When once the Ameri-
cans have taken up an idea, whether it be well or ill founded,
nothing is more difficult than to eradicate it from their minds.
The same tenacity of opinion has been observed in England,
where, for the last century, greater freedom of conscience
and more invincible prejudices have existed than in all the
other countries of Europe. I attribute this consequence to a
cause which may at first sight appear to have a very opposite
tendency, namely, to the liberty of the press. The nations
amongst which this liberty exists are as apt to cling to their
opinions from pride as from conviction. They cherish them

because they hold them to be just, and because they exer-
cised their own free-will in choosing them; and they main-
tain them not only because they are true, but because they
are their own. Several other reasons conduce to the same
end.
It was remarked by a man of genius that “ignorance lies at
the two ends of knowledge.” Perhaps it would have been
more correct to have said, that absolute convictions are to be
met with at the two extremities, and that doubt lies in the
middle; for the human intellect may be considered in three
distinct states, which frequently succeed one another. A man
believes implicitly, because he adopts a proposition without
inquiry. He doubts as soon as he is assailed by the objections
which his inquiries may have aroused. But he frequently suc-
ceeds in satisfying these doubts, and then he begins to be-
lieve afresh: he no longer lays hold on a truth in its most
shadowy and uncertain form, but he sees it clearly before
him, and he advances onwards by the light it gives him.*
*It may, however, be doubted whether this rational and self-
guiding conviction arouses as much fervor or enthusiastic
devotedness in men as their first dogmatical belief.

When the liberty of the press acts upon men who are in
the first of these three states, it does not immediately disturb
their habit of believing implicitly without investigation, but
it constantly modifies the objects of their intuitive convic-
tions. The human mind continues to discern but one point
upon the whole intellectual horizon, and that point is in
continual motion. Such are the symptoms of sudden revolu-
tions, and of the misfortunes which are sure to befall those
generations which abruptly adopt the unconditional free-
dom of the press.
The circle of novel ideas is, however, soon terminated; the
touch of experience is upon them, and the doubt and mis-
trust which their uncertainty produces become universal. We
may rest assured that the majority of mankind will either
believe they know not wherefore, or will not know what to
believe. Few are the beings who can ever hope to attain to
that state of rational and independent conviction which true
knowledge can beget in defiance of the attacks of doubt.
It has been remarked that in times of great religious fervor
men sometimes change their religious opinions; whereas in
times of general scepticism everyone clings to his own per-

Chapter Summary

association – Three kinds of political associations – In what
manner the Americans apply the representative system to
associations – Dangers resulting to the State – Great Con-
vention of 1831 relative to the Tariff – Legislative character

Political Associations In The United States

In no country in the world has the principle of association
been more successfully used, or more unsparingly applied to
a multitude of different objects, than in America. Besides
the permanent associations which are established by law
under the names of townships, cities, and counties, a vast

number of others are formed and maintained by the agency
of private individuals.
The citizen of the United States is taught from his earliest
infancy to rely upon his own exertions in order to resist the
evils and the difficulties of life; he looks upon social author-
ity with an eye of mistrust and anxiety, and he only claims
its assistance when he is quite unable to shift without it. This
habit may even be traced in the schools of the rising genera-
tion, where the children in their games are wont to submit
to rules which they have themselves established, and to pun-
ish misdemeanors which they have themselves defined. The
same spirit pervades every act of social life. If a stoppage
occurs in a thoroughfare, and the circulation of the public is
hindered, the neighbors immediately constitute a delibera-
tive body; and this extemporaneous assembly gives rise to an
executive power which remedies the inconvenience before
anybody has thought of recurring to an authority superior
to that of the persons immediately concerned. If the public
pleasures are concerned, an association is formed to provide
for the splendor and the regularity of the entertainment. So-
cieties are formed to resist enemies which are exclusively of a

moral nature, and to diminish the vice of intemperance: in
the United States associations are established to promote
public order, commerce, industry, morality, and religion; for
there is no end which the human will, seconded by the col-
lective exertions of individuals, despairs of attaining.
I shall hereafter have occasion to show the effects of asso-
ciation upon the course of society, and I must confine my-
self for the present to the political world. When once the
right of association is recognized, the citizens may employ it
in several different ways.
An association consists simply in the public assent which a
number of individuals give to certain doctrines, and in the
engagement which they contract to promote the spread of
those doctrines by their exertions. The right of association
with these views is very analogous to the liberty of unlicensed
writing; but societies thus formed possess more authority
than the press. When an opinion is represented by a society,
it necessarily assumes a more exact and explicit form. It num-
bers its partisans, and compromises their welfare in its cause:
they, on the other hand, become acquainted with each other,
and their zeal is increased by their number. An association

unites the efforts of minds which have a tendency to diverge
in one single channel, and urges them vigorously towards
one single end which it points out.
The second degree in the right of association is the power
of meeting. When an association is allowed to establish cen-
tres of action at certain important points in the country, its
activity is increased and its influence extended. Men have
the opportunity of seeing each other; means of execution are
more readily combined, and opinions are maintained with a
degree of warmth and energy which written language can-
not approach.
Lastly, in the exercise of the right of political association,
there is a third degree: the partisans of an opinion may unite
in electoral bodies, and choose delegates to represent them
in a central assembly. This is, properly speaking, the applica-
tion of the representative system to a party.
Thus, in the first instance, a society is formed between indi-
viduals professing the same opinion, and the tie which keeps
it together is of a purely intellectual nature; in the second case,
small assemblies are formed which only represent a fraction of
the party. Lastly, in the third case, they constitute a separate

Carolina alone, which afterwards took up arms in the same
cause, sent sixty-three delegates. On October 1, 1831, this
assembly, which according to the American custom had taken
the name of a Convention, met at Philadelphia; it consisted
of more than two hundred members. Its debates were pub-
lic, and they at once assumed a legislative character; the ex-
tent of the powers of Congress, the theories of free trade,
and the different clauses of the tariff, were discussed in turn.
At the end of ten days’ deliberation the Convention broke
up, after having published an address to the American people,
in which it declared:

I. That Congress had not the right of making a tariff, and
that the existing tariff was unconstitutional;

II. That the prohibition of free trade was prejudicial to the
interests of all nations, and to that of the American people in
particular.

It must be acknowledged that the unrestrained liberty of
political association has not hitherto produced, in the United

subjects which it treated within certain limits. It is probable,
in fact, that the Convention of 1831 exercised a very great
influence upon the minds of the malcontents, and prepared
them for the open revolt against the commercial laws of the
Union which took place in 1832.
It cannot be denied that the unrestrained liberty of associa-
tion for political purposes is the privilege which a people is
longest in learning how to exercise. If it does not throw the
nation into anarchy, it perpetually augments the chances of
that calamity. On one point, however, this perilous liberty of-
fers a security against dangers of another kind; in countries
where associations are free, secret societies are unknown. In
America there are numerous factions, but no conspiracies.
Different ways in which the right of association is under-
stood in Europeand in the United States – Different use which
is made of it.
The most natural privilege of man, next to the right of
acting for himself, is that of combining his exertions with
those of his fellow-creatures, and of acting in common with
them. I am therefore led to conclude that the right of asso-
ciation is almost as inalienable as the right of personal lib-

association is understood in the United States. In America
the citizens who form the minority associate, in order, in the
first place, to show their numerical strength, and so to di-
minish the moral authority of the majority; and, in the sec-
ond place, to stimulate competition, and to discover those
arguments which are most fitted to act upon the majority;
for they always entertain hopes of drawing over their oppo-
nents to their own side, and of afterwards disposing of the
supreme power in their name. Political associations in the
United States are therefore peaceable in their intentions, and
strictly legal in the means which they employ; and they as-
sert with perfect truth that they only aim at success by law-
ful expedients.
The difference which exists between the Americans and
ourselves depends on several causes. In Europe there are nu-
merous parties so diametrically opposed to the majority that
they can never hope to acquire its support, and at the same
time they think that they are sufficiently strong in them-
selves to struggle and to defend their cause. When a party of
this kind forms an association, its object is, not to conquer,
but to fight. In America the individuals who hold opinions

very much opposed to those of the majority are no sort of
impediment to its power, and all other parties hope to win it
over to their own principles in the end. The exercise of the
right of association becomes dangerous in proportion to the
impossibility which excludes great parties from acquiring the
majority. In a country like the United States, in which the
differences of opinion are mere differences of hue, the right
of association may remain unrestrained without evil conse-
quences. The inexperience of many of the European nations
in the enjoyment of liberty leads them only to look upon the
liberty of association as a right of attacking the Government.
The first notion which presents itself to a party, as well as to
an individual, when it has acquired a consciousness of its
own strength, is that of violence: the notion of persuasion
arises at a later period and is only derived from experience.
The English, who are divided into parties which differ most
essentially from each other, rarely abuse the right of associa-
tion, because they have long been accustomed to exercise it.
In France the passion for war is so intense that there is no
undertaking so mad, or so injurious to the welfare of the
State, that a man does not consider himself honored in de-

over society by the Government which they attack. Their
moral force is much diminished by these excesses, and they
lose the powerful interest which is always excited by a struggle
between oppressors and the oppressed. The man who in given
cases consents to obey his fellows with servility, and who
submits his activity and even his opinions to their control,
can have no claim to rank as a free citizen.
The Americans have also established certain forms of gov-
ernment which are applied to their associations, but these
are invariably borrowed from the forms of the civil adminis-
tration. The independence of each individual is formally rec-
ognized; the tendency of the members of the association
points, as it does in the body of the community, towards the
same end, but they are not obliged to follow the same track.
No one abjures the exercise of his reason and his free will;
but every one exerts that reason and that will for the benefit
of a common undertaking.

Chapter XIII: Government of the Democracy in
America – Part I

I am well aware of the difficulties which attend this part of
my subject, but although every expression which I am about
to make use of may clash, upon some one point, with the
feelings of the different parties which divide my country, I
shall speak my opinion with the most perfect openness.
In Europe we are at a loss how to judge the true character
and the more permanent propensities of democracy, because
in Europe two conflicting principles exist, and we do not
know what to attribute to the principles themselves, and what
to refer to the passions which they bring into collision. Such,
however, is not the case in America; there the people reigns
without any obstacle, and it has no perils to dread and no
injuries to avenge. In America, democracy is swayed by its
own free propensities; its course is natural and its activity is
unrestrained; the United States consequently afford the most
favorable opportunity of studying its real character. And to
no people can this inquiry be more vitally interesting than
to the French nation, which is blindly driven onwards by a

daily and irresistible impulse towards a state of things which
may prove either despotic or republican, but which will as-
suredly be democratic.

Universal Suffrage

I have already observed that universal suffrage has been
adopted in all the States of the Union; it consequently oc-
curs amongst different populations which occupy very dif-
ferent positions in the scale of society. I have had opportuni-
ties of observing its effects in different localities, and amongst
races of men who are nearly strangers to each other by their
language, their religion, and their manner of life; in Louisi-
ana as well as in New England, in Georgia and in Canada. I
have remarked that Universal Suffrage is far from producing
in America either all the good or all the evil consequences
which are assigned to it in Europe, and that its effects differ
very widely from those which are usually attributed to it.

Choice of the People, and Instinctive Preferences of the
American Democracy

In the United States the most able men are rarely placed at
the head of affairs – Reason of this peculiarity – The envy
which prevails in the lower orders of France against the higher
classes is not a French, but a purely democratic sentiment –
For what reason the most distinguished men in America fre-
quently seclude themselves from public affairs.

Many people in Europe are apt to believe without saying it,
or to say without believing it, that one of the great advan-
tages of universal suffrage is, that it entrusts the direction of
public affairs to men who are worthy of the public confi-
dence. They admit that the people is unable to govern for
itself, but they aver that it is always sincerely disposed to
promote the welfare of the State, and that it instinctively
designates those persons who are animated by the same good
wishes, and who are the most fit to wield the supreme au-
thority. I confess that the observations I made in America by
no means coincide with these opinions. On my arrival in the

to procure the means of physical subsistence, that is to say,
as long as it retains its popular character. It is therefore quite
as difficult to imagine a State in which all the citizens should
be very well informed as a State in which they should all be
wealthy; these two difficulties may be looked upon as cor-
relative. It may very readily be admitted that the mass of the
citizens are sincerely disposed to promote the welfare of their
country; nay more, it may even be allowed that the lower
classes are less apt to be swayed by considerations of per-
sonal interest than the higher orders: but it is always more or
less impossible for them to discern the best means of attain-
ing the end which they desire with sincerity. Long and pa-
tient observation, joined to a multitude of different notions,
is required to form a just estimate of the character of a single
individual; and can it be supposed that the vulgar have the
power of succeeding in an inquiry which misleads the pen-
etration of genius itself? The people has neither the time nor
the means which are essential to the prosecution of an inves-
tigation of this kind: its conclusions are hastily formed from
a superficial inspection of the more prominent features of a
question. Hence it often assents to the clamor of a mounte-

to the acrimony of disappointment. Whatever transcends
their own limits appears to be an obstacle to their desires,
and there is no kind of superiority, however legitimate it may
be, which is not irksome in their sight.
It has been supposed that the secret instinct which leads
the lower orders to remove their superiors as much as pos-
sible from the direction of public affairs is peculiar to France.
This, however, is an error; the propensity to which I allude is
not inherent in any particular nation, but in democratic in-
stitutions in general; and although it may have been height-
ened by peculiar political circumstances, it owes its origin to
a higher cause.
In the United States the people is not disposed to hate the
superior classes of society; but it is not very favorably in-
clined towards them, and it carefully excludes them from
the exercise of authority. It does not entertain any dread of
distinguished talents, but it is rarely captivated by them; and
it awards its approbation very sparingly to such as have risen
without the popular support.
Whilst the natural propensities of democracy induce the
people to reject the most distinguished citizens as its rulers,

these individuals are no less apt to retire from a political ca-
reer in which it is almost impossible to retain their indepen-
dence, or to advance without degrading themselves. This
opinion has been very candidly set forth by Chancellor Kent,
who says, in speaking with great eulogiums of that part of
the Constitution which empowers the Executive to nomi-
nate the judges: “It is indeed probable that the men who are
best fitted to discharge the duties of this high office would
have too much reserve in their manners, and too much aus-
terity in their principles, for them to be returned by the ma-
jority at an election where universal suffrage is adopted.” Such
were the opinions which were printed without contradic-
tion in America in the year 1830!
I hold it to be sufficiently demonstrated that universal suf-
frage is by no means a guarantee of the wisdom of the popu-
lar choice, and that, whatever its advantages may be, this is
not one of them.

Causes Which May Partly Correct These Tendencies Of The
Democracy Contrary effects produced on peoples as well as
on individuals by great dangers – Why so many distinguished
men stood at the head of affairs in America fifty years ago –
Influence which the intelligence and the manners of the
people exercise upon its choice – Example of New England
– States of the Southwest – Influence of certain laws upon
the choice of the people –Election by an elected body – Its
effects upon the composition of the Senate.

When a State is threatened by serious dangers, the people
frequently succeeds in selecting the citizens who are the most
able to save it. It has been observed that man rarely retains
his customary level in presence of very critical circumstances;
he rises above or he sinks below his usual condition, and the
same thing occurs in nations at large. Extreme perils some-
times quench the energy of a people instead of stimulating
it; they excite without directing its passions, and instead of
clearing they confuse its powers of perception. The Jews del-
uged the smoking ruins of their temple with the carnage of
the remnant of their host. But it is more common, both in

it is from an inspection of the ordinary course of affairs that
our judgment must be formed.
If passing occurrences sometimes act as checks upon the
passions of democracy, the intelligence and the manners of
the community exercise an influence which is not less pow-
erful and far more permanent. This is extremely perceptible
in the United States.
In New England the education and the liberties of the com-
munities were engendered by the moral and religious prin-
ciples of their founders. Where society has acquired a suffi-
cient degree of stability to enable it to hold certain maxims
and to retain fixed habits, the lower orders are accustomed
to respect intellectual superiority and to submit to it with-
out complaint, although they set at naught all those privi-
leges which wealth and birth have introduced among man-
kind. The democracy in New England consequently makes
a more judicious choice than it does elsewhere.
But as we descend towards the South, to those States in
which the constitution of society is more modern and less
strong, where instruction is less general, and where the prin-
ciples of morality, of religion, and of liberty are less happily

citizens names the legislature of each State, and the Federal
Constitution converts these legislatures into so many elec-
toral bodies, which return the members of the Senate. The
senators are elected by an indirect application of universal
suffrage; for the legislatures which name them are not aristo-
cratic or privileged bodies which exercise the electoral fran-
chise in their own right; but they are chosen by the totality
of the citizens; they are generally elected every year, and new
members may constantly be chosen who will employ their
electoral rights in conformity with the wishes of the public.
But this transmission of the popular authority through an
assembly of chosen men operates an important change in it,
by refining its discretion and improving the forms which it
adopts. Men who are chosen in this manner accurately rep-
resent the majority of the nation which governs them; but
they represent the elevated thoughts which are current in
the community, the propensities which prompt its nobler
actions, rather than the petty passions which disturb or the
vices which disgrace it.
The time may be already anticipated at which the Ameri-
can Republics will be obliged to introduce the plan of elec-

tion by an elected body more frequently into their system of
representation, or they will incur no small risk of perishing
miserably amongst the shoals of democracy.
And here I have no scruple in confessing that I look upon
this peculiar system of election as the only means of bring-
ing the exercise of political power to the level of all classes of
the people. Those thinkers who regard this institution as the
exclusive weapon of a party, and those who fear, on the other
hand, to make use of it, seem to me to fall into as great an
error in the one case as in the other.

Influence Which the American Democracy Has Exercised
on the Laws Relating to Elections

When elections are rare, they expose the State to a violent
crisis – When they are frequent, they keep up a degree of
feverish excitement – The Americans have preferred the sec-
ond of these two evils – Mutability of the laws – Opinions of
Hamilton and Jefferson on this subject.

When elections recur at long intervals the State is exposed to

whose general results are beneficial. But no one in the United
States affects to deny the fact of this instability, or to con-
tend that it is not a great evil.
Hamilton, after having demonstrated the utility of a power
which might prevent, or which might at least impede, the
promulgation of bad laws, adds: “It might perhaps be said
that the power of preventing bad laws includes that of pre-
venting good ones, and may be used to the one purpose as
well as to the other. But this objection will have little weight
with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that
inconstancy and mutability in the laws which form the great-
est blemish in the character and genius of our governments.”
(Federalist, No. 73.) And again in No. 62 of the same work
he observes: “The facility and excess of law-making seem to
be the diseases to which our governments are most liable….
The mischievous effects of the mutability in the public coun-
cils arising from a rapid succession of new members would
fill a volume: every new election in the States is found to
change one-half of the representatives. From this change of
men must proceed a change of opinions and of measures,
which forfeits the respect and confidence of other nations,

poisons the blessings of liberty itself, and diminishes the at-
tachment and reverence of the people toward a political sys-
tem which betrays so many marks of infirmity.”
Jefferson himself, the greatest Democrat whom the democ-
racy of America has yet produced, pointed out the same evils.
“The instability of our laws,” said he in a letter to Madison,
“is really a very serious inconvenience. I think that we ought
to have obviated it by deciding that a whole year should al-
ways be allowed to elapse between the bringing in of a bill
and the final passing of it. It should afterward be discussed
and put to the vote without the possibility of making any
alteration in it; and if the circumstances of the case required
a more speedy decision, the question should not be decided
by a simple majority, but by a majority of at least two-thirds
of both houses.”

Public Officers Under The Control Of The Democracy In
America Simple exterior of the American public officers –
No official costume – All public officers are remunerated –
Political consequences of this system – No public career ex-
ists in America – Result of this.

Public officers in the United States are commingled with the
crowd of citizens; they have neither palaces, nor guards, nor
ceremonial costumes. This simple exterior of the persons in
authority is connected not only with the peculiarities of the
American character, but with the fundamental principles of
that society. In the estimation of the democracy a govern-
ment is not a benefit, but a necessary evil. A certain degree
of power must be granted to public officers, for they would
be of no use without it. But the ostensible semblance of au-
thority is by no means indispensable to the conduct of af-
fairs, and it is needlessly offensive to the susceptibility of the
public. The public officers themselves are well aware that
they only enjoy the superiority over their fellow-citizens which
they derive from their authority upon condition of putting
themselves on a level with the whole community by their

lute dominion which democracy exercises in that country.
All public services, of whatsoever nature they may be, are
paid; so that every one has not merely the right, but also the
means of performing them. Although, in democratic States,
all the citizens are qualified to occupy stations in the Gov-
ernment, all are not tempted to try for them. The number
and the capacities of the candidates are more apt to restrict
the choice of electors than the coneitions of the candidateship.
In nations in which the principle of election extends to
every place in the State no political career can, properly speak-
ing, be said to exist. Men are promoted as if by chance to the
rank which they enjoy, and they are by no means sure of
retaining it. The consequence is that in tranquil times public
functions offer but few lures to ambition. In the United States
the persons who engage in the perplexities of political life
are individuals of very moderate pretensions. The pursuit of
wealth generally diverts men of great talents and of great
passions from the pursuit of power, and it very frequently
happens that a man does not undertake to direct the fortune
of the State until he has discovered his incompetence to con-
duct his own affairs. The vast number of very ordinary men

who occupy public stations is quite as attributable to these
causes as to the bad choice of the democracy. In the United
States, I am not sure that the people would return the men
of superior abilities who might solicit its support, but it is
certain that men of this description do not come forward.

Arbitrary Power of Magistrates under the Rule of the
American Democracy

For what reason the arbitrary power of Magistrates is greater
in absolute monarchies and in democratic republics than it
is in limited monarchies – Arbitrary power of the Magis-
trates in New England.

In two different kinds of government the magistrates* exer-
cise a considerable degree of arbitrary power; namely, under
the absolute government of a single individual, and under
that of a democracy. This identical result proceeds from causes
which are nearly analogous.
*I here use the word magistrates in the widest sense in which
it can be taken; I apply it to all the officers to whom the
execution of the laws is intrusted.

magistrate must be still greater than in despotic States. In the
latter the sovereign has the power of punishing all the faults
with which he becomes acquainted, but it would be vain for
him to hope to become acquainted with all those which are
committed. In the former the sovereign power is not only su-
preme, but it is universally present. The American functionar-
ies are, in point of fact, much more independent in the sphere
of action which the law traces out for them than any public
officer in Europe. Very frequently the object which they are to
accomplish is simply pointed out to them, and the choice of
the means is left to their own discretion.
In New England, for instance, the selectmen of each town-
ship are bound to draw up the list of persons who are to
serve on the jury; the only rule which is laid down to guide
them in their choice is that they are to select citizens possess-
ing the elective franchise and enjoying a fair reputation.* In
France the lives and liberties of the subjects would be thought
to be in danger if a public officer of any kind was entrusted
with so formidable a right. In New England the same magis-

trates are empowered to post the names of habitual drunk-
ards in public-houses, and to prohibit the inhabitants of a
town from supplying them with liquor.* A censorial power
of this excessive kind would be revolting to the population
of the most absolute monarchies; here, however, it is sub-
mitted to without difficulty.
Nowhere has so much been left by the law to the arbitrary
determination of the magistrate as in democratic republics,
because this arbitrary power is unattended by any alarming
consequences. It may even be asserted that the freedom of
the magistrate increases as the elective franchise is extended,
and as the duration of the time of office is shortened. Hence
arises the great difficulty which attends the conversion of a
democratic republic into a monarchy. The magistrate ceases
to be elective, but he retains the rights and the habits of an
elected officer, which lead directly to despotism.
It is only in limited monarchies that the law, which pre-
scribes the sphere in which public officers are to act, super-
intends all their measures. The cause of this may be easily
detected. In limited monarchies the power is divided between
*See the Act of February 27, 1813. “General Collection of
the Laws of Massachusetts,” vol. ii. p. 331. It should be added
that the jurors are afterwards drawn from these lists by lot.
*See Act of February 28, 1787. “General Collection of the
Laws of Massachusetts,” vol. i. p. 302.

the King and the people, both of whom are interested in the
stability of the magistrate. The King does not venture to place
the public officers under the control of the people, lest they
should be tempted to betray his interests; on the other hand,
the people fears lest the magistrates should serve to oppress
the liberties of the country, if they were entirely dependent
upon the Crown; they cannot therefore be said to depend
on either one or the other. The same cause which induces
the king and the people to render public officers indepen-
dent suggests the necessity of such securities as may prevent
their independence from encroaching upon the authority of
the former and the liberties of the latter. They consequently
agree as to the necessity of restricting the functionary to a
line of conduct laid down beforehand, and they are inter-
ested in confining him by certain regulations which he can-
not evade.

Chapter XIII: Government of the Democarcy in
America – Part II Instability of the Administra-
tion in the United States

In America the public acts of a community frequently leave
fewer traces than the occurrences of a family – Newspapers
the only historical remains – Instability of the administra-
tion prejudicial to the art of government.

The authority which public men possess in America is so
brief, and they are so soon commingled with the ever-chang-
ing population of the country, that the acts of a community
frequently leave fewer traces than the occurrences of a pri-
vate family. The public administration is, so to speak, oral
and traditionary. But little is committed to writing, and that
little is wafted away forever, like the leaves of the Sibyl, by
the smallest breeze.
The only historical remains in the United States are the
newspapers; but if a number be wanting, the chain of time is
broken, and the present is severed from the past. I am con-
vinced that in fifty years it will be more difficult to collect

authentic documents concerning the social condition of the
Americans at the present day than it is to find remains of the
administration of France during the Middle Ages; and if the
United States were ever invaded by barbarians, it would be
necessary to have recourse to the history of other nations in
order to learn anything of the people which now inhabits them.
The instability of the administration has penetrated into
the habits of the people: it even appears to suit the general
taste, and no one cares for what occurred before his time. No
methodical system is pursued; no archives are formed; and no
documents are brought together when it would be very easy
to do so. Where they exist, little store is set upon them; and I
have amongst my papers several original public documents
which were given to me in answer to some of my inquiries. In
America society seems to live from hand to mouth, like an
army in the field. Nevertheless, the art of administration may
undoubtedly be ranked as a science, and no sciences can be
improved if the discoveries and observations of successive gen-
erations are not connected together in the order in which they
occur. One man, in the short space of his life remarks a fact;
another conceives an idea; the former invents a means of ex-
ecution, the latter reduces a truth to a fixed proposition; and

mankind gathers the fruits of individual experience upon its
way and gradually forms the sciences. But the persons who
conduct the administration in America can seldom afford any
instruction to each other; and when they assume the direction
of society, they simply possess those attainments which are
most widely disseminated in the community, and no experi-
ence peculiar to themselves. Democracy, carried to its furthest
limits, is therefore prejudicial to the art of government; and
for this reason it is better adapted to a people already versed in
the conduct of an administration than to a nation which is
uninitiated in public affairs.
This remark, indeed, is not exclusively applicable to the
science of administration. Although a democratic govern-
ment is founded upon a very simple and natural principle, it
always presupposes the existence of a high degree of culture
and enlightenment in society.* At the first glance it may be
imagined to belong to the earliest ages of the world; but
maturer observation will convince us that it could only come
last in the succession of human history.
*It is needless to observe that I speak here of the democratic
form of government as applied to a people, not merely to a
tribe.

Charges Levied by the State under the Rule
of the American Democracy

In all communities citizens divisible into three classes – Habits
of each of these classes in the direction of public finances –
Why public expenditure must tend to increase when the
people governs – What renders the extravagance of a democ-
racy less to be feared in America – Public expenditure under
a democracy.

Before we can affirm whether a democratic form of govern-
ment is economical or not, we must establish a suitable stan-
dard of comparison. The question would be one of easy so-
lution if we were to attempt to draw a parallel between a
democratic republic and an absolute monarchy. The public
expenditure would be found to be more considerable under
the former than under the latter; such is the case with all free
States compared to those which are not so. It is certain that
despotism ruins individuals by preventing them from pro-
ducing wealth, much more than by depriving them of the
wealth they have produced; it dries up the source of riches,

whilst it usually respects acquired property. Freedom, on the
contrary, engenders far more benefits than it destroys; and
the nations which are favored by free institutions invariably
find that their resources increase even more rapidly than their
taxes.
My present object is to compare free nations to each other,
and to point out the influence of democracy upon the fi-
nances of a State.
Communities, as well as organic bodies, are subject to cer-
tain fixed rules in their formation which they cannot evade.
They are composed of certain elements which are common
to them at all times and under all circumstances. The people
may always be mentally divided into three distinct classes.
The first of these classes consists of the wealthy; the second,
of those who are in easy circumstances; and the third is com-
posed of those who have little or no property, and who sub-
sist more especially by the work which they perform for the
two superior orders. The proportion of the individuals who
are included in these three divisions may vary according to
the condition of society, but the divisions themselves can
never be obliterated.

their own; and those who are possessed of some little prop-
erty readily find means of regulating the taxes so that they
are burdensome to the wealthy and profitable to the poor,
although the rich are unable to take the same advantage when
they are in possession of the Government.
In countries in which the poor* should be exclusively in-
vested with the power of making the laws no great economy
of public expenditure ought to be expected: that expendi-
ture will always be considerable; either because the taxes do
not weigh upon those who levy them, or because they are
levied in such a manner as not to weigh upon those classes.
In other words, the government of the democracy is the only
one under which the power which lays on taxes escapes the
payment of them.
It may be objected (but the argument has no real weight)
that the true interest of the people is indissolubly connected
with that of the wealthier portion of the community, since it

*The word poor is used here, and throughout the remainder
of this chapter, in a relative, not in an absolute sense. Poor
men in America would often appear rich in comparison with
the poor of Europe; but they may with propriety by styled
poor in comparison with their more affluent countrymen.

zens possess some fortune, is in a still more favorable posi-
tion than France.
There are still further causes which may increase the sum of
public expenditure in democratic countries. When the aris-
tocracy governs, the individuals who conduct the affairs of
State are exempted by their own station in society from every
kind of privation; they are contented with their position; power
and renown are the objects for which they strive; and, as they
are placed far above the obscurer throng of citizens, they do
not always distinctly perceive how the well-being of the mass
of the people ought to redound to their own honor. They are
not indeed callous to the sufferings of the poor, but they can-
not feel those miseries as acutely as if they were themselves
partakers of them. Provided that the people appear to submit
to its lot, the rulers are satisfied, and they demand nothing
further from the Government. An aristocracy is more intent
upon the means of maintaining its influence than upon the
means of improving its condition.
When, on the contrary, the people is invested with the
supreme authority, the perpetual sense of their own miseries
impels the rulers of society to seek for perpetual ameliora-

tions. A thousand different objects are subjected to improve-
ment; the most trivial details are sought out as susceptible of
amendment; and those changes which are accompanied with
considerable expense are more especially advocated, since the
object is to render the condition of the poor more tolerable,
who cannot pay for themselves.
Moreover, all democratic communities are agitated by an
ill-defined excitement and by a kind of feverish impatience,
that engender a multitude of innovations, almost all of which
are attended with expense.
In monarchies and aristocracies the natural taste which
the rulers have for power and for renown is stimulated by
the promptings of ambition, and they are frequently incited
by these temptations to very costly undertakings. In democ-
racies, where the rulers labor under privations, they can only
be courted by such means as improve their well-being, and
these improvements cannot take place without a sacrifice of
money. When a people begins to reflect upon its situation, it
discovers a multitude of wants to which it had not before
been subject, and to satisfy these exigencies recourse must be
had to the coffers of the State. Hence it arises that the public

charges increase in proportion as civilization spreads, and
that imposts are augmented as knowledge pervades the com-
munity.
The last cause which frequently renders a democratic gov-
ernment dearer than any other is, that a democracy does not
always succeed in moderating its expenditure, because it does
not understand the art of being economical. As the designs
which it entertains are frequently changed, and the agents of
those designs are still more frequently removed, its under-
takings are often ill conducted or left unfinished: in the former
case the State spends sums out of all proportion to the end
which it proposes to accomplish; in the second, the expense
itself is unprofitable.*

Tendencies of the American Democracy as Regards the
Salaries of Public Officers

In the democracies those who establish high salaries have no
chance of profiting by them – Tendency of the American
democracy to increase the salaries of subordinate officers and
to lower those of the more important functionaries – Reason
of this – Comparative statement of the salaries of public of-
ficers in the United States and in France.

There is a powerful reason which usually induces democra-
cies to economize upon the salaries of public officers. As the
number of citizens who dispense the remuneration is ex-
tremely large in democratic countries, so the number of per-
sons who can hope to be benefited by the receipt of it is
comparatively small. In aristocratic countries, on the con-
trary, the individuals who fix high salaries have almost al-
ways a vague hope of profiting by them. These appointments
may be looked upon as a capital which they create for their
own use, or at least as a resource for their children.
It must, however, be allowed that a democratic State is most

*The gross receipts of the Treasury of the United States in
1832 were about $28,000,000; in 1870 they had risen to
$411,000,000. The gross expenditure in 1832 was
$30,000,000; in 1870, $309,000,000.

parsimonious towards its principal agents. In America the
secondary officers are much better paid, and the dignitaries
of the administration much worse, than they are elsewhere.
These opposite effects result from the same cause; the
people fixes the salaries of the public officers in both cases;
and the scale of remuneration is determined by the consid-
eration of its own wants. It is held to be fair that the servants
of the public should be placed in the same easy circumstances
as the public itself;* but when the question turns upon the
salaries of the great officers of State, this rule fails, and chance
alone can guide the popular decision. The poor have no ad-
equate conception of the wants which the higher classes of
society may feel. The sum which is scanty to the rich appears
enormous to the poor man whose wants do not extend be-
yond the necessaries of life; and in his estimation the Gover-
nor of a State, with his twelve or fifteen hundred dollars a
year, is a very fortunate and enviable being.** If you under-

take to convince him that the representative of a great people
ought to be able to maintain some show of splendor in the
eyes of foreign nations, he will perhaps assent to your mean-
ing; but when he reflects on his own humble dwelling, and
on the hard- earned produce of his wearisome toil, he re-
members all that he could do with a salary which you say is
insufficient, and he is startled or almost frightened at the
sight of such uncommon wealth. Besides, the secondary pub-
lic officer is almost on a level with the people, whilst the
others are raised above it. The former may therefore excite
his interest, but the latter begins to arouse his envy.
This is very clearly seen in the United States, where the
salaries seem to decrease as the authority of those who re-
ceive them augments*
*To render this assertion perfectly evident, it will suffice to
examine the scale of salaries of the agents of the Federal
Government. I have added the salaries attached to the corre-
sponding officers in France under the constitutional monar-
chy to complete the comparison.

United States Treasury Department
Messenger ................................................................  $700
Clerk with lowest salary ........................................... 1,000
Clerk with highest salary .......................................... 1,600

*The easy circumstances in which secondary functionaries are placed in
the United States result also from another cause, which is independent
of the general tendencies of democracy; every kind of private business is
very lucrative, and the State would not be served at all if it did not pay its
servants. The country is in the position of a commercial undertaking,
which is obliged to sustain an expensive competition, notwithstanding
its tastes for economy.
**The State of Ohio, which contains a million of inhabitants, gives its
Governor a salary of only $1,200 a year.

Chief Clerk .............................................................. 2,000
Secretary of State ...................................................... 6,000
The President ......................................................... 25,000

France Ministere des Finances Hussier .................. 1,500 fr.
Clerk with lowest salary, ..........................1,000 to 1,800 fr.

Secretaire-general .................................................20,000 fr.
The Minister .........................................................80,000 fr.
The King ......................................................12,000,000 fr.

I have perhaps done wrong in selecting France as my stan-
dard of comparison. In France the democratic tendencies of
the nation exercise an ever-increasing influence upon the
Government, and the Chambers show a disposition to raise
the low salaries and to lower the principal ones. Thus, the
Minister of Finance, who received 160,000 fr. under the
Empire, receives 80,000 fr. in 1835: the Directeurs-generaux
of Finance, who then received 50,000 fr. now receive only
20,000 fr. [This comparison is based on the state of things
existing in France and the United States in 1831. It has since
materially altered in both countries, but not so much as to
impugn the truth of the author’s observation.]

facilitate the enjoyments of the people.* The money raised
by taxation may be better employed, but it is not saved. In
general, democracy gives largely to the community, and very
sparingly to those who govern it. The reverse is the case in
aristocratic countries, where the money of the State is ex-
pended to the profit of the persons who are at the head of
affairs.

Difficulty of Distinguishing the Causes Which Contrib-
ute to the Economy of the American Government

We are liable to frequent errors in the research of those facts
which exercise a serious influence upon the fate of mankind,
since nothing is more difficult than to appreciate their real

*See the American budgets for the cost of indigent citizens
and gratuitous instruction. In 1831 $250,000 were spent in
the State of New York for the maintenance of the poor, and
at least $1,000,000 were devoted to gratuitous instruction.
(William’s “New York Annual Register,” 1832, pp. 205 and
243.) The State of New York contained only 1,900,000 in-
habitants in the year 1830, which is not more than double
the amount of population in the Department du Nord in
France.

only because they live under democratic institutions, but
because they are a commercial nation. The habits of private
life are continued in public; and we ought carefully to dis-
tinguish that economy which depends upon their institu-
tions from that which is the natural result of their manners
and customs.

Whether the Expenditure of the United States Can Be
Compared to That of France

Two points to be established in order to estimate the extent
of the public charges, viz., the national wealth and the rate
of taxation – The wealth and the charges of France not accu-
rately known – Why the wealth and charges of the Union
cannot be accurately known – Researches of the author with
a view to discover the amount of taxation of Pennsylvania –
General symptoms which may serve to indicate the amount
of the public charges in a given nation – Result of this inves-
tigation for the Union.

Many attempts have recently been made in France to com-

rately determined, and no means exist of computing that of
the latter.
I consent, therefore, for the sake of the discussion, to aban-
don this necessary term of the comparison, and I confine
myself to a computation of the actual amount of taxation,
without investigating the relation which subsists between the
taxation and the revenue. But the reader will perceive that
my task has not been facilitated by the limits which I here
lay down for my researches.
It cannot be doubted that the central administration of
France, assisted by all the public officers who are at its dis-
posal, might determine with exactitude the amount of the
direct and indirect taxes levied upon the citizens. But this
investigation, which no private individual can undertake, has
not hitherto been completed by the French Government, or,
at least, its results have not been made public. We are ac-
quainted with the sum total of the charges of the State; we
know the amount of the departmental expenditure; but the
expenses of the communal divisions have not been computed,
and the amount of the public expenses of France is conse-
quently unknown.
If we now turn to America, we shall perceive that the dif-

ficulties are multiplied and enhanced. The Union publishes
an exact return of the amount of its expenditure; the bud-
gets of the four and twenty States furnish similar returns of
their revenues; but the expenses incident to the affairs of the
counties and the townships are unknown.*
*The Americans, as we have seen, have four separate budgets, the Union,
the States, the Counties, and the Townships having each severally their
own. During my stay in America I made every endeavor to discover the
amount of the public expenditure in the townships and counties of the
principal States of the Union, and I readily obtained the budget of the
larger townships, but I found it quite impossible to procure that of the
smaller ones. I possess, however, some documents relating to county
expenses, which, although incomplete, are still curious. I have to thank
Mr. Richards, Mayor of Philadelphia, for the budgets of thirteen of the
counties of Pennsylvania, viz., Lebanon, Centre, Franklin, Fayette, Mont-
gomery, Luzerne, Dauphin, Butler, Alleghany, Columbia, Northampton,
Northumberland, and Philadelphia, for the year 1830. Their popula-
tion at that time consisted of 495,207 inhabitants. On looking at the
map of Pennsylvania, it will be seen that these thirteen counties are scat-
tered in every direction, and so generally affected by the causes which
usually influence the condition of a country, that they may easily be
supposed to furnish a correct average of the financial state of the coun-
ties of Pennsylvania in general; and thus, upon reckoning that the ex-
penses of these counties amounted in the year 1830 to about $361,650,
or nearly 75 cents for each inhabitant, and calculating that each of them
contributed in the same year about $2.55 towards the Union, and about
75 cents to the State of Pennsylvania, it appears that they each contrib-
uted as their share of all the public expenses (except those of the town-
ships) the sum of $4.05. This calculation is doubly incomplete, as it
applies only to a single year and to one part of the public charges; but it
has at least the merit of not being conjectural.

The authority of the Federal government cannot oblige
the provincial governments to throw any light upon this
point; and even if these governments were inclined to afford
their simultaneous co- operation, it may be doubted whether
they possess the means of procuring a satisfactory answer.
Independently of the natural difficulties of the task, the po-
litical organization of the country would act as a hindrance
to the success of their efforts. The county and town magis-
trates are not appointed by the authorities of the State, and
they are not subjected to their control. It is therefore very
allowable to suppose that, if the State was desirous of ob-
taining the returns which we require, its design would be
counteracted by the neglect of those subordinate officers
whom it would be obliged to employ.* It is, in point of fact,
useless to inquire what the Americans might do to forward
this inquiry, since it is certain that they have hitherto done
nothing at all. There does not exist a single individual at the
present day, in America or in Europe, who can inform us
what each citizen of the Union annually contributes to the
public charges of the nation.**
*Those who have attempted to draw a comparison between the
expenses of France and America have at once perceived that no

Democracy in America
such comparison could be drawn between the total expenditure
of the two countries; but they have endeavored to contrast de-
tached portions of this expenditure. It may readily be shown that
this second system is not at all less defective than the first. If I
attempt to compare the French budget with the budget of the
Union, it must be remembered that the latter embraces much fewer
objects than then central Government of the former country, and
that the expenditure must consequently be much smaller. If I con-
trast the budgets of the Departments with those of the States which
constitute the Union, it must be observed that, as the power and
control exercised by the States is much greater than that which is
exercised by the Departments, their expenditure is also more con-
siderable. As for the budgets of the counties, nothing of the kind
occurs in the French system of finances; and it is, again, doubtful
whether the corresponding expenses should be referred to the bud-
get of the State or to those of the municipal divisions. Municipal
expenses exist in both countries, but they are not always analo-
gous. In America the townships discharge a variety of offices which
are reserved in France to the Departments or to the State. It may,
moreover, be asked what is to be understood by the municipal
expenses of America. The organization of the municipal bodies or
townships differs in the several States. Are we to be guided by
what occurs in New England or in Georgia, in Pennsylvania or in
the State of Illinois? A kind of analogy may very readily be per-
ceived between certain budgets in the two countries; but as the
elements of which they are composed always differ more or less,
no fair comparison can be instituted between them. [The same
difficulty exists, perhaps to a greater degree at the present time,
when the taxation of America has largely increased. – 1874.]]

**Even if we knew the exact pecuniary contributions of every French
and American citizen to the coffers of the State, we should only
come at a portion of the truth. Governments do not only demand
supplies of money, but they call for personal services, which may be

looked upon as equivalent to a given sum. When a State raises an
army, besides the pay of the troops, which is furnished by the entire
nation, each soldier must give up his time, the value of which de-
pends on the use he might make of it if he were not in the service.
The same remark applies to the militia; the citizen who is in the
militia devotes a certain portion of valuable time to the mainte-
nance of the public peace, and he does in reality surrender to the
State those earnings which he is prevented from gaining. Many other
instances might be cited in addition to these. The governments of
France and of America both levy taxes of this kind, which weigh
upon the citizens; but who can estimate with accuracy their relative
amount in the two countries?
This, however, is not the last of the difficulties which prevent us
from comparing the expenditure of the Union with that of France.
The French Government contracts certain obligations which do
not exist in America, and vice versa. The French Government pays
the clergy; in America the voluntary principle prevails. In America
there is a legal provision for the poor; in France they are aban-
doned to the charity of the public. The French public officers are
paid by a fixed salary; in America they are allowed certain perqui-
sites. In France contributions in kind take place on very few roads;
in America upon almost all the thoroughfares: in the former coun-
try the roads are free to all travellers; in the latter turnpikes abound.
All these differences in the manner in which contributions are
levied in the two countries enhance the difficulty of comparing
their expenditure; for there are certain expenses which the citizens
would not be subject to, or which would at any rate be much less
considerable, if the State did not take upon itself to act in the
name of the public.

try. The observer who draws his inferences from these signs
will, undoubtedly, be led to the conclusion that the Ameri-
can of the United States contributes a much smaller portion
of his income to the State than the citizen of France. Nor,
indeed, can the result be otherwise.
A portion of the French debt is the consequence of two
successive invasions; and the Union has no similar calamity
to fear. A nation placed upon the continent of Europe is
obliged to maintain a large standing army; the isolated posi-
tion of the Union enables it to have only 6,000 soldiers. The
French have a fleet of 300 sail; the Americans have 52 ves-
sels.* How, then, can the inhabitants of the Union be called
upon to contribute as largely as the inhabitants of France?
No parallel can be drawn between the finances of two coun-
tries so differently situated.
*See the details in the Budget of the French Minister of
Marine; and for America, the National Calendar of 1833, p.
228. [But the public debt of the United States in 1870, caused
by the Civil War, amounted to $2,480,672,427; that of
France was more than doubled by the extravagance of the
Second Empire and by the war of 1870.]

the expenditure of the State, they are apt to augment that
expenditure.
I conclude, therefore, without having recourse to inaccu-
rate computations, and without hazarding a comparison
which might prove incorrect, that the democratic govern-
ment of the Americans is not a cheap government, as is some-
times asserted; and I have no hesitation in predicting that, if
the people of the United States is ever involved in serious
difficulties, its taxation will speedily be increased to the rate
of that which prevails in the greater part of the aristocracies
and the monarchies of Europe.*

*[That is precisely what has since occurred.]

Chapter XIII: Government of the Democracy in
America – Part III Corruption and Vices of the
Rulers in a Democracy, and Consequent Effects
upon Public Morality

In aristocracies rulers sometimes endeavor to corrupt the
people – In democracies rulers frequently show themselves
to be corrupt – In the former their vices are directly prejudi-
cial to the morality of the people – In the latter their indirect
influence is still more pernicious.

A distinction must be made, when the aristocratic and the
democratic principles mutually inveigh against each other,
as tending to facilitate corruption. In aristocratic governments
the individuals who are placed at the head of affairs are rich
men, who are solely desirous of power. In democracies states-
men are poor, and they have their fortunes to make. The
consequence is that in aristocratic States the rulers are rarely
accessible to corruption, and have very little craving for
money; whilst the reverse is the case in democratic nations.
But in aristocracies, as those who are desirous of arriving

is a kind of aristocratic refinement and an air of grandeur in
the depravity of the great, which frequently prevent it from
spreading abroad.
The people can never penetrate into the perplexing laby-
rinth of court intrigue, and it will always have difficulty in
detecting the turpitude which lurks under elegant manners,
refined tastes, and graceful language. But to pillage the pub-
lic purse, and to vend the favors of the State, are arts which
the meanest villain may comprehend, and hope to practice
in his turn.
In reality it is far less prejudicial to witness the immorality
of the great than to witness that immorality which leads to
greatness. In a democracy private citizens see a man of their
own rank in life, who rises from that obscure position, and
who becomes possessed of riches and of power in a few years;
the spectacle excites their surprise and their envy, and they
are led to inquire how the person who was yesterday their
equal is to-day their ruler. To attribute his rise to his talents
or his virtues is unpleasant; for it is tacitly to acknowledge
that they are themselves less virtuous and less talented than
he was. They are therefore led (and not unfrequently their

conjecture is a correct one) to impute his success mainly to
some one of his defects; and an odious mixture is thus formed
of the ideas of turpitude and power, unworthiness and suc-
cess, utility and dishonor.

Efforts of Which a Democracy Is Capable

The Union has only had one struggle hitherto for its exist-
ence – Enthusiasm at the commencement of the war – In-
difference towards its close – Difficulty of establishing mili-
tary conscription or impressment of seamen in America –
Why a democratic people is less capable of sustained effort
than another.

I here warn the reader that I speak of a government which
implicitly follows the real desires of a people, and not of a
government which simply commands in its name. Nothing
is so irresistible as a tyrannical power commanding in the
name of the people, because, whilst it exercises that moral
influence which belongs to the decision of the majority, it
acts at the same time with the promptitude and the tenacity

of a single man.
It is difficult to say what degree of exertion a democratic
government may be capable of making a crisis in the history
of the nation. But no great democratic republic has hitherto
existed in the world. To style the oligarchy which ruled over
France in 1793 by that name would be to offer an insult to
the republican form of government. The United States af-
ford the first example of the kind.
The American Union has now subsisted for half a century,
in the course of which time its existence has only once been
attacked, namely, during the War of Independence. At the
commencement of that long war, various occurrences took
place which betokened an extraordinary zeal for the service
of the country.* But as the contest was prolonged, symp-
toms of private egotism began to show themselves. No money
was poured into the public treasury; few recruits could be
raised to join the army; the people wished to acquire inde-
*One of the most singular of these occurrences was the reso-
lution which the Americans took of temporarily abandon-
ing the use of tea. Those who know that men usually cling
more to their habits than to their life will doubtless admire
this great though obscure sacrifice which was made by a whole
people.

pendence, but was very ill-disposed to undergo the priva-
tions by which alone it could be obtained. “Tax laws,” says
Hamilton in the “Federalist” (No. 12), “have in vain been
multiplied; new methods to enforce the collection have in
vain been tried; the public expectation has been uniformly
disappointed and the treasuries of the States have remained
empty. The popular system of administration inherent in
the nature of popular government, coinciding with the real
scarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated state
of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for exten-
sive collections, and has at length taught the different legis-
latures the folly of attempting them.”
The United States have not had any serious war to carry
on ever since that period. In order, therefore, to appreciate
the sacrifices which democratic nations may impose upon
themselves, we must wait until the American people is obliged
to put half its entire income at the disposal of the Govern-
ment, as was done by the English; or until it sends forth a
twentieth part of its population to the field of battle, as was
done by France.*
*The Civil War showed that when the necessity arose the
American people, both in the North and in the South, are
capable of making the most enormous sacrifices, both in
money and in men.

exercises the supreme authority, to submit to impressment
or any compulsory system.
It is incontestable that in times of danger a free people
displays far more energy than one which is not so. But I
incline to believe that this is more especially the case in those
free nations in which the democratic element preponder-
ates. Democracy appears to me to be much better adapted
for the peaceful conduct of society, or for an occasional ef-
fort of remarkable vigor, than for the hardy and prolonged
endurance of the storms which beset the political existence
of nations. The reason is very evident; it is enthusiasm which
prompts men to expose themselves to dangers and priva-
tions, but they will not support them long without reflec-
tion. There is more calculation, even in the impulses of brav-
ery, than is generally attributed to them; and although the
first efforts are suggested by passion, perseverance is main-
tained by a distinct regard of the purpose in view. A portion
of what we value is exposed, in order to save the remainder.
But it is this distinct perception of the future, founded
upon a sound judgment and an enlightened experience,
which is most frequently wanting in democracies. The popu-

never combine, upon a single point and at a given time, so
much power as an aristocracy or a monarchy. If a democratic
country remained during a whole century subject to a re-
publican government, it would probably at the end of that
period be more populous and more prosperous than the
neighboring despotic States. But it would have incurred the
risk of being conquered much oftener than they would in
that lapse of years.

Self-Control of the American Democracy

The American people acquiesces slowly, or frequently does
not acquiesce, in what is beneficial to its interests – The faults
of the American democracy are for the most part reparable.

The difficulty which a democracy has in conquering the pas-
sions and in subduing the exigencies of the moment, with a
view to the future, is conspicuous in the most trivial occur-
rences of the United States. The people, which is surrounded
by flatterers, has great difficulty in surmounting its inclina-
tions, and whenever it is solicited to undergo a privation or

the right path when once it has acknowledged its mistake,
are greater also; because it is rarely embarrassed by internal
interests, which conflict with those of the majority, and re-
sist the authority ofreason. But a democracy can only obtain
truth as the result of experience, and many nations may for-
feit their existence whilst they are awaiting the consequences
of their errors.
The great privilege of the Americans does not simply con-
sist in their being more enlightened than other nations, but in
their being able to repair the faults they may commit. To which
it must be added, that a democracy cannot derive substantial
benefit from past experience, unless it be arrived at a certain
pitch of knowledge and civilization. There are tribes and peoples
whose education has been so vicious, and whose character pre-
sents so strange a mixture of passion, of ignorance, and of
erroneous notions upon all subjects, that they are unable to
discern the causes of their own wretchedness, and they fall a
sacrifice to ills with which they are unacquainted.
I have crossed vast tracts of country that were formerly
inhabited by powerful Indian nations which are now extinct;
I have myself passed some time in the midst of mutilated

tribes, which witness the daily decline of their numerical
strength and of the glory of their independence; and I have
heard these Indians themselves anticipate the impending
doom of their race. Every European can perceive means which
would rescue these unfortunate beings from inevitable de-
struction. They alone are insensible to the expedient; they
feel the woe which year after year heaps upon their heads,
but they will perish to a man without accepting the remedy.
It would be necessary to employ force to induce them to
submit to the protection and the constraint of civilization.
The incessant revolutions which have convulsed the South
American provinces for the last quarter of a century have
frequently been adverted to with astonishment, and expec-
tations have been expressed that those nations would speed-
ily return to their natural state. But can it be affirmed that
the turmoil of revolution is not actually the most natural
state of the South American Spaniards at the present time?
In that country society is plunged into difficulties from which
all its efforts are insufficient to rescue it. The inhabitants of
that fair portion of the Western Hemisphere seem obstinately
bent on pursuing the work of inward havoc. If they fall into

a momentary repose from the effects of exhaustion, that re-
pose prepares them for a fresh state of frenzy. When I con-
sider their condition, which alternates between misery and
crime, I should be inclined to believe that despotism itself
would be a benefit to them, if it were possible that the words
despotism and benefit could ever be united in my mind.

Conduct Of Foreign Affairs By The American Democracy

Direction given to the foreign policy of the United States by
Washington and Jefferson – Almost all the defects inherent in
democratic institutions are brought to light in the conduct of
foreign affairs – Their advantages are less perceptible.

We have seen that the Federal Constitution entrusts the per-
manent direction of the external interests of the nation to
the President and the Senate,* which tends in some degree

*“The President,” says the Constitution, Art. II, sect. 2, Section 2,
“shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Sen-
ate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present
concur.” The reader is reminded that the senators are returned for
a term of six years, and that they are chosen by the legislature of
each State.

tant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different
course. If we remain one people, under an efficient govern-
ment, the period is not far off when we may defy material
injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an
attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time re-
solve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent
nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon
us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when
we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by jus-
tice, shall counsel. Why forego the advantages of so peculiar
a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground?
Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of
Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of
European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice? It
is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with
any portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are
now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as ca-
pable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements. I hold
the maxim no less applicable to public than to private af-
fairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it; there-
fore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense;

These two principles, which were so plain and so just as to
be adapted to the capacity of the populace, have greatly sim-
plified the foreign policy of the United States. As the Union
takes no part in the affairs of Europe, it has, properly speak-
ing, no foreign interests to discuss, since it has at present no
powerful neighbors on the American continent. The country
is as much removed from the passions of the Old World by its
position as by the line of policy which it has chosen, and it is
neither called upon to repudiate nor to espouse the conflict-
ing interests of Europe; whilst the dissensions of the New World
are still concealed within the bosom of the future.
The Union is free from all pre-existing obligations, and it
is consequently enabled to profit by the experience of the
old nations of Europe, without being obliged, as they are, to
make the best of the past, and to adapt it to their present
circumstances; or to accept that immense inheritance which
they derive from their forefathers – an inheritance of glory
mingled with calamities, and of alliances conflicting with
national antipathies. The foreign policy of the United States
is reduced by its very nature to await the chances of the fu-
ture history of the nation, and for the present it consists more

he adopted, and which has since been unanimously approved
by the nation.* If the Constitution and the favor of the pub-
lic had not entrusted the direction of the foreign affairs of
the country to Washington, it is certain that the American
nation would at that time have taken the very measures which
it now condemns.
*See the fifth volume of Marshall’s “Life of Washington.” In
a government constituted like that of the United States,” he
says, “it is impossible for the chief magistrate, however firm
he may be, to oppose for any length of time the torrent of
popular opinion; and the prevalent opinion of that day
seemed to incline to war. In fact, in the session of Congress
held at the time, it was frequently seen that Washington had
lost the majority in the House of Representatives.” The vio-
lence of the language used against him in public was ex-
treme, and in a political meeting they did not scruple to
compare him indirectly to the treacherous Arnold. “By the
opposition,” says Marshall, “the friends of the administra-
tion were declared to be an aristocratic and corrupt faction,
who, from a desire to introduce monarchy, were hostile to
France and under the influence of Britain; that they were a
paper nobility, whose extreme sensibility at every measure
which threatened the funds, induced a tame submission to
injuries and insults, which the interests and honor of the
nation required them to resist.”

Almost all the nations which have ever exercised a power-
ful influence upon the destinies of the world by conceiving,
following up, and executing vast designs – from the Romans
to the English – have been governed by aristocratic institu-
tions. Nor will this be a subject of wonder when we recollect
that nothing in the world has so absolute a fixity of purpose
as an aristocracy. The mass of the people may be led astray
by ignorance or passion; the mind of a king may be biased,
and his perseverance in his designs may be shaken – besides
which a king is not immortal – but an aristocratic body is
too numerous to be led astray by the blandishments of in-
trigue, and yet not numerous enough to yield readily to the
intoxicating influence of unreflecting passion: it has the en-
ergy of a firm and enlightened individual, added to the power
which it derives from perpetuity.

Chapter XIV: Advantages American Society
Derive From Democracy – Part I

What the Real Advantages Are Which American Society
Derives from the Government of the Democracy

Before I enter upon the subject of the present chapter I am
induced to remind the reader of what I have more than once
adverted to in the course of this book. The political institu-
tions of the United States appear to me to be one of the
forms of government which a democracy may adopt; but I
do not regard the American Constitution as the best, or as
the only one, which a democratic people may establish. In
showing the advantages which the Americans derive from
the government of democracy, I am therefore very far from
meaning, or from believing, that similar advantages can only
be obtained from the same laws.

General Tendency of the Laws under the Rule of the
American Democracy, and Habits of Those Who Apply
Them

Defects of a democratic government easy to be discovered –
Its advantages only to be discerned by long observation –
Democracy in America often inexpert, but the general ten-
dency of the laws advantageous – In the American democ-
racy public officers have no permanent interests distinct from
those of the majority – Result of this state of things.

The defects and the weaknesses of a democratic government
may very readily be discovered; they are demonstrated by
the most flagrant instances, whilst its beneficial influence is
less perceptibly exercised. A single glance suffices to detect
its evil consequences, but its good qualities can only be dis-
cerned by long observation. The laws of the American de-
mocracy are frequently defective or incomplete; they some-
times attack vested rights, or give a sanction to others which
are dangerous to the community; but even if they were good,
the frequent changes which they undergo would be an evil.

community. This is precisely what has occurred in the United
States; and I repeat, what I have before remarked, that the
great advantage of the Americans consists in their being able
to commit faults which they may afterward repair.
An analogous observation may be made respecting public
officers. It is easy to perceive that the American democracy
frequently errs in the choice of the individuals to whom it
entrusts the power of the administration; but it is more dif-
ficult to say why the State prospers under their rule. In the
first place it is to be remarked, that if in a democratic State
the governors have less honesty and less capacity than else-
where, the governed, on the other hand, are more enlight-
ened and more attentive to their interests. As the people in
democracies is more incessantly vigilant in its affairs and more
jealous of its rights, it prevents its representatives from aban-
doning that general line of conduct which its own interest
prescribes. In the second place, it must be remembered that
if the democratic magistrate is more apt to misuse his power,
he possesses it for a shorter period of time. But there is yet
another reason which is still more general and conclusive. It
is no doubt of importance to the welfare of nations that they

very serious risks. The advantage of democracy does not con-
sist, therefore, as has sometimes been asserted, in favoring
the prosperity of all, but simply in contributing to the well-
being of the greatest possible number.
The men who are entrusted with the direction of public
affairs in the United States are frequently inferior, both in
point of capacity and of morality, to those whom aristocratic
institutions would raise to power. But their interest is identi-
fied and confounded with that of the majority of their fel-
low-citizens. They may frequently be faithless and frequently
mistaken, but they will never systematically adopt a line of
conduct opposed to the will of the majority; and it is impos-
sible that they should give a dangerous or an exclusive ten-
dency to the government.
The mal-administration of a democratic magistrate is a
mere isolated fact, which only occurs during the short pe-
riod for which he is elected. Corruption and incapacity do
not act as common interests, which may connect men per-
manently with one another. A corrupt or an incapable mag-
istrate will not concert his measures with another magistrate,
simply because that individual is as corrupt and as incapable

as himself; and these two men will never unite their endeav-
ors to promote the corruption and inaptitude of their re-
mote posterity. The ambition and the manoeuvres of the one
will serve, on the contrary, to unmask the other. The vices of
a magistrate, in democratic states, are usually peculiar to his
own person.
But under aristocratic governments public men are swayed
by the interest of their order, which, if it is sometimes con-
founded with the interests of the majority, is very frequently
distinct from them. This interest is the common and lasting
bond which unites them together; it induces them to coa-
lesce, and to combine their efforts in order to attain an end
which does not always ensure the greatest happiness of the
greatest number; and it serves not only to connect the per-
sons in authority, but to unite them to a considerable por-
tion of the community, since a numerous body of citizens
belongs to the aristocracy, without being invested with offi-
cial functions. The aristocratic magistrate is therefore con-
stantly supported by a portion of the community, as well as
by the Government of which he is a member.
The common purpose which connects the interest of the

renown.*

In the United States, where the public officers have no
interests to promote connected with their caste, the general
and constant influence of the Government is beneficial, al-
though the individuals who conduct it are frequently unskilful
and sometimes contemptible. There is indeed a secret ten-
dency in democratic institutions to render the exertions of
the citizens subservient to the prosperity of the community,
notwithstanding their private vices and mistakes; whilst in
aristocratic institutions there is a secret propensity which,
notwithstanding the talents and the virtues of those who con-
duct the government, leads them to contribute to the evils
which oppress their fellow-creatures. In aristocratic govern-
ments public men may frequently do injuries which they do
not intend, and in democratic states they produce advan-
tages which they never thought of.

Public Spirit In The United States

Patriotism of instinct – Patriotism of reflection – Their dif-
ferent characteristics – Nations ought to strive to acquire the
second when the first has disappeared – Efforts of the Ameri-
cans to it – Interest of the individual intimately connected
with that of the country.

There is one sort of patriotic attachment which principally
arises from that instinctive, disinterested, and undefinable
feeling which connects the affections of man with his birth-
place. This natural fondness is united to a taste for ancient
customs, and to a reverence for ancestral traditions of the
past; those who cherish it love their country as they love the
mansions of their fathers. They enjoy the tranquillity which
it affords them; they cling to the peaceful habits which they
have contracted within its bosom; they are attached to the
reminiscences which it awakens, and they are even pleased
by the state of obedience in which they are placed. This pa-
triotism is sometimes stimulated by religious enthusiasm, and
then it is capable of making the most prodigious efforts. It is

*The legislation of England for the forty years is certainly
not fairly open to this criticism, which was written before
the Reform Bill of 1832, and accordingly Great Britain has
thus far escaped and surmounted the perils and calamities to
which she seemed to be exposed.

for of that they doubt; nor in the laws, which do not origi-
nate in their own authority; nor in the legislator, whom they
fear and despise. The country is lost to their senses, they can
neither discover it under its own nor under borrowed fea-
tures, and they entrench themselves within the dull precincts
of a narrow egotism. They are emancipated from prejudice
without having acknowledged the empire of reason; they are
neither animated by the instinctive patriotism of monarchi-
cal subjects nor by the thinking patriotism of republican citi-
zens; but they have stopped halfway between the two, in the
midst of confusion and of distress.
In this predicament, to retreat is impossible; for a people
cannot restore the vivacity of its earlier times, any more than
a man can return to the innocence and the bloom of child-
hood; such things may be regretted, but they cannot be re-
newed. The only thing, then, which remains to be done is to
proceed, and to accelerate the union of private with public
interests, since the period of disinterested patriotism is gone
by forever.
I am certainly very far from averring that, in order to ob-
tain this result, the exercise of political rights should be im-

America the people regards this prosperity as the result of its
own exertions; the citizen looks upon the fortune of the public
as his private interest, and he co-operates in its success, not
so much from a sense of pride or of duty, as from what I
shall venture to term cupidity.
It is unnecessary to study the institutions and the history
of the Americans in order to discover the truth of this re-
mark, for their manners render it sufficiently evident. As the
American participates in all that is done in his country, he
thinks himself obliged to defend whatever may be censured;
for it is not only his country which is attacked upon these
occasions, but it is himself. The consequence is, that his na-
tional pride resorts to a thousand artifices, and to all the
petty tricks of individual vanity.
Nothing is more embarrassing in the ordinary intercourse
of life than this irritable patriotism of the Americans. A
stranger may be very well inclined to praise many of the in-
stitutions of their country, but he begs permission to blame
some of the peculiarities which he observes – a permission
which is, however, inexorably refused. America is therefore a
free country, in which, lest anybody should be hurt by your

remarks, you are not allowed to speak freely of private indi-
viduals, or of the State, of the citizens or of the authorities,
of public or of private undertakings, or, in short, of anything
at all, except it be of the climate and the soil; and even then
Americans will be found ready to defend either the one or
the other, as if they had been contrived by the inhabitants of
the country.
In our times option must be made between the patriotism
of all and the government of a few; for the force and activity
which the first confers are irreconcilable with the guarantees
of tranquillity which the second furnishes.

Notion Of Rights In The United States

No great people without a notion of rights – How the no-
tion of rights can be given to people – Respect of rights in
the United States – Whence it arises.

After the idea of virtue, I know no higher principle than that
of right; or, to speak more accurately, these two ideas are
commingled in one. The idea of right is simply that of virtue

thing which he can lay his hands upon to his own purposes;
he has no notion of the property of others; but as he gradu-
ally learns the value of things, and begins to perceive that he
may in his turn be deprived of his possessions, he becomes
more circumspect, and he observes those rights in others
which he wishes to have respected in himself. The principle
which the child derives from the possession of his toys is
taught to the man by the objects which he may call his own.
In America those complaints against property in general
which are so frequent in Europe are never heard, because in
America there are no paupers; and as everyone has property
of his own to defend, everyone recognizes the principle upon
which he holds it.
The same thing occurs in the political world. In America
the lowest classes have conceived a very high notion of po-
litical rights, because they exercise those rights; and they re-
frain from attacking those of other people, in order to en-
sure their own from attack. Whilst in Europe the same classes
sometimes recalcitrate even against the supreme power, the
American submits without a murmur to the authority of the
pettiest magistrate.

This truth is exemplified by the most trivial details of na-
tional peculiarities. In France very few pleasures are exclu-
sively reserved for the higher classes; the poor are admitted
wherever the rich are received, and they consequently be-
have with propriety, and respect whatever contributes to the
enjoyments in which they themselves participate. In England,
where wealth has a monopoly of amusement as well as of
power, complaints are made that whenever the poor happen
to steal into the enclosures which are reserved for the plea-
sures of the rich, they commit acts of wanton mischief: can
this be wondered at, since care has been taken that they should
have nothing to lose?*

The government of democracy brings the notion of politi-
cal rights to the level of the humblest citizens, just as the
dissemination of wealth brings the notion of property within
the reach of all the members of the community; and I con-
fess that, to my mind, this is one of its greatest advantages. I
do not assert that it is easy to teach men to exercise political

*This, too, has been amended by much larger provisions for
the amusements of the people in public parks, gardens, mu-
seums, etc.; and the conduct of the people in these places of
amusement has improved in the same proportion.

in prodigies than the art of being free; but there is nothing
more arduous than the apprenticeship of liberty. Such is not
the case with despotic institutions: despotism often prom-
ises to make amends for a thousand previous ills; it supports
the right, it protects the oppressed, and it maintains public
order. The nation is lulled by the temporary prosperity which
accrues to it, until it is roused to a sense of its own misery.
Liberty, on the contrary, is generally established in the midst
of agitation, it is perfected by civil discord, and its benefits
cannot be appreciated until it is already old.

Chapter XIV: Advantages American Society
Derive from Democracy – Part II

Respect for the Law in the United States

Respect of the Americans for the law – Parental affection
which they entertain for it – Personal interest of everyone to
increase the authority of the law.

It is not always feasible to consult the whole people, either
directly or indirectly, in the formation of the law; but it can-
not be denied that, when such a measure is possible the au-
thority of the law is very much augmented. This popular
origin, which impairs the excellence and the wisdom of leg-
islation, contributes prodigiously to increase its power. There
is an amazing strength in the expression of the determina-
tion of a whole people, and when it declares itself the imagi-
nation of those who are most inclined to contest it is over-
awed by its authority. The truth of this fact is very well known
by parties, and they consequently strive to make out a ma-
jority whenever they can. If they have not the greater num-

ber of voters on their side, they assert that the true majority
abstained from voting; and if they are foiled even there, they
have recourse to the body of those persons who had no votes
to give.
In the United States, except slaves, servants, and paupers
in the receipt of relief from the townships, there is no class of
persons who do not exercise the elective franchise, and who
do not indirectly contribute to make the laws. Those who
design to attack the laws must consequently either modify
the opinion of the nation or trample upon its decision.
A second reason, which is still more weighty, may be fur-
ther adduced; in the United States everyone is personally
interested in enforcing the obedience of the whole commu-
nity to the law; for as the minority may shortly rally the
majority to its principles, it is interested in professing that
respect for the decrees of the legislator which it may soon
have occasion to claim for its own. However irksome an en-
actment may be, the citizen of the United States complies
with it, not only because it is the work of the majority, but
because it originates in his own authority, and he regards it
as a contract to which he is himself a party.

prevents them from making the law, prevents them from
withstanding it. Amongst civilized nations revolts are rarely
excited, except by such persons as have nothing to lose by
them; and if the laws of a democracy are not always worthy
of respect, at least they always obtain it; for those who usu-
ally infringe the laws have no excuse for not complying with
the enactments they have themselves made, and by which
they are themselves benefited, whilst the citizens whose in-
terests might be promoted by the infraction of them are in-
duced, by their character and their stations, to submit to the
decisions of the legislature, whatever they may be. Besides
which, the people in America obeys the law not only be-
cause it emanates from the popular authority, but because
that authority may modify it in any points which may prove
vexatory; a law is observed because it is a self-imposed evil in
the first place, and an evil of transient duration in the sec-
ond.

Activity Which Pervades All the Branches of the Body
Politic in the United States; Influence Which It Exercises
upon Society

More difficult to conceive the political activity which per-
vades the United States than the freedom and equality which
reign there – The great activity which perpetually agitates
the legislative bodies is only an episode to the general activ-
ity – Difficult for an American to confine himself to his own
business – Political agitation extends to all social intercourse
– Commercial activity of the Americans partly attributable
to this cause – Indirect advantages which society derives from
a democratic government.

On passing from a country in which free institutions are
established to one where they do not exist, the traveller is
struck by the change; in the former all is bustle and activity,
in the latter everything is calm and motionless. In the one,
amelioration and progress are the general topics of inquiry;
in the other, it seems as if the community only aspired to
repose in the enjoyment of the advantages which it has ac-

tumult; a confused clamor is heard on every side; and a thou-
sand simultaneous voices demand the immediate satisfac-
tion of their social wants. Everything is in motion around
you; here, the people of one quarter of a town are met to
decide upon the building of a church; there, the election of a
representative is going on; a little further the delegates of a
district are posting to the town in order to consult upon
some local improvements; or in another place the laborers of
a village quit their ploughs to deliberate upon the project of
a road or a public school. Meetings are called for the sole
purpose of declaring their disapprobation of the line of con-
duct pursued by the Government; whilst in other assemblies
the citizens salute the authorities of the day as the fathers of
their country. Societies are formed which regard drunken-
ness as the principal cause of the evils under which the State
labors, and which solemnly bind themselves to give a con-
stant example of temperance.*
*At the time of my stay in the United States the temperance
societies already consisted of more than 270,000 members,
and their effect had been to diminish the consumption of
fermented liquors by 500,000 gallons per annum in the State
of Pennsylvania alone.

The great political agitation of the American legislative bod-
ies, which is the only kind of excitement that attracts the
attention of foreign countries, is a mere episode or a sort of
continuation of that universal movement which originates
in the lowest classes of the people and extends successively
to all the ranks of society. It is impossible to spend more
efforts in the pursuit of enjoyment.
The cares of political life engross a most prominent place
in the occupation of a citizen in the United States, and al-
most the only pleasure of which an American has any idea is
to take a part in the Government, and to discuss the part he
has taken. This feeling pervades the most trifling habits of
life; even the women frequently attend public meetings and
listen to political harangues as a recreation after their house-
hold labors. Debating clubs are to a certain extent a substi-
tute for theatrical entertainments: an American cannot con-
verse, but he can discuss; and when he attempts to talk he
falls into a dissertation. He speaks to you as if he was ad-
dressing a meeting; and if he should chance to warm in the
course of the discussion, he will infallibly say, “Gentlemen,”
to the person with whom he is conversing.

In some countries the inhabitants display a certain repug-
nance to avail themselves of the political privileges with which
the law invests them; it would seem that they set too high a
value upon their time to spend it on the interests of the com-
munity; and they prefer to withdraw within the exact limits
of a wholesome egotism, marked out by four sunk fences
and a quickset hedge. But if an American were condemned
to confine his activity to his own affairs, he would be robbed
of one half of his existence; he would feel an immense void
in the life which he is accustomed to lead, and his wretched-
ness would be unbearable.* I am persuaded that, if ever a
despotic government is established in America, it will find it
more difficult to surmount the habits which free institutions
have engendered than to conquer the attachment of the citi-
zens to freedom.
This ceaseless agitation which democratic government has
introduced into the political world influences all social in-

*The same remark was made at Rome under the first Caesars.
Montesquieu somewhere alludes to the excessive despondency
of certain Roman citizens who, after the excitement of po-
litical life, were all at once flung back into the stagnation of
private life.

Chapter XV: Unlimited Power Of Majority, And
Its Consequences – Part I

Chapter Summary

Natural strength of the majority in democracies – Most of
the American Constitutions have increased this strength by
artificial means – How this has been done – Pledged del-
egates – Moral power of the majority – Opinion as to its
infallibility – Respect for its rights, how augmented in the
United States.

Unlimited Power Of The Majority In The United States,
And Its Consequences

The very essence of democratic government consists in the
absolute sovereignty of the majority; for there is nothing in
democratic States which is capable of resisting it. Most of
the American Constitutions have sought to increase this natu-
ral strength of the majority by artificial means.*
*We observed, in examining the Federal Constitution, that the efforts of
the legislators of the Union had been diametrically opposed to the present
tendency. The consequence has been that the Federal Government is more
independent in its sphere than that of the States. But the Federal Govern-
ment scarcely ever interferes in any but external affairs; and the govern-
ments of the State are in the governments of the States are in reality the
authorities which direct society in America.

assailed in its last retreat by a doctrine which the minority
hesitate to admit, and in which they very slowly concur. Like
all other powers, and perhaps more than all other powers,
the authority of the many requires the sanction of time; at
first it enforces obedience by constraint, but its laws are not
respected until they have long been maintained.
The right of governing society, which the majority sup-
poses itself to derive from its superior intelligence, was in-
troduced into the United States by the first settlers, and this
idea, which would be sufficient of itself to create a free na-
tion, has now been amalgamated with the manners of the
people and the minor incidents of social intercourse.
The French, under the old monarchy, held it for a maxim
(which is still a fundamental principle of the English Con-
stitution) that the King could do no wrong; and if he did do
wrong, the blame was imputed to his advisers. This notion
was highly favorable to habits of obedience, and it enabled
the subject to complain of the law without ceasing to love
and honor the lawgiver. The Americans entertain the same
opinion with respect to the majority.
The moral power of the majority is founded upon yet an-

sive privileges, and it cannot cede its privileges without ceas-
ing to be an aristocracy.
In the United States political questions cannot be taken
up in so general and absolute a manner, and all parties are
willing to recognize the right of the majority, because they
all hope to turn those rights to their own advantage at some
future time. The majority therefore in that country exercises
a prodigious actual authority, and a moral influence which is
scarcely less preponderant; no obstacles exist which can im-
pede or so much as retard its progress, or which can induce
it to heed the complaints of those whom it crushes upon its
path. This state of things is fatal in itself and dangerous for
the future.
How The Unlimited Power Of The Majority Increases In
America The Instability Of Legislation And Administration
Inherent In Democracy The Americans increase the muta-
bility of the laws which is inherent in democracy by chang-
ing the legislature every year, and by investing it with un-
bounded authority – The same effect is produced upon the
administration – In America social amelioration is conducted
more energetically but less perseveringly than in Europe.

laws themselves, a single glance upon the archives of the dif-
ferent States of the Union suffices to convince one that in
America the activity of the legislator never slackens. Not that
the American democracy is naturally less stable than any
other, but that it is allowed to follow its capricious propensi-
ties in the formation of the laws.*

The omnipotence of the majority, and the rapid as well as
absolute manner in which its decisions are executed in the
United States, has not only the effect of rendering the law
unstable, but it exercises the same influence upon the execu-
tion of the law and the conduct of the public administra-
tion. As the majority is the only power which it is important
to court, all its projects are taken up with the greatest ardor,
but no sooner is its attention distracted than all this ardor

*The legislative acts promulgated by the State of Massachu-
setts alone, from the year 1780 to the present time, already
fill three stout volumes; and it must not be forgotten that
the collection to which I allude was published in 1823, when
many old laws which had fallen into disuse were omitted.
The State of Massachusetts, which is not more populous than
a department of France, may be considered as the most stable,
the most consistent, and the most sagacious in its undertak-
ings of the whole Union.

ceases; whilst in the free States of Europe the administration
is at once independent and secure, so that the projects of the
legislature are put into execution, although its immediate
attention may be directed to other objects.
In America certain ameliorations are undertaken with much
more zeal and activity than elsewhere; in Europe the same
ends are promoted by much less social effort, more continu-
ously applied.
Some years ago several pious individuals undertook to ame-
liorate the condition of the prisons. The public was excited
by the statements which they put forward, and the regenera-
tion of criminals became a very popular undertaking. New
prisons were built, and for the first time the idea of reform-
ing as well as of punishing the delinquent formed a part of
prison discipline. But this happy alteration, in which the
public had taken so hearty an interest, and which the exer-
tions of the citizens had irresistibly accelerated, could not be
completed in a moment. Whilst the new penitentiaries were
being erected (and it was the pleasure of the majority that
they should be terminated with all possible celerity), the old
prisons existed, which still contained a great number of of-

fenders. These jails became more unwholesome and more
corrupt in proportion as the new establishments were beau-
tified and improved, forming a contrast which may readily
be understood. The majority was so eagerly employed in
founding the new prisons that those which already existed
were forgotten; and as the general attention was diverted to
a novel object, the care which had hitherto been bestowed
upon the others ceased. The salutary regulations of disci-
pline were first relaxed, and afterwards broken; so that in the
immediate neighborhood of a prison which bore witness to
the mild and enlightened spirit of our time, dungeons might
be met with which reminded the visitor of the barbarity of
the Middle Ages.

Chapter XV: Unlimited Power Of Majority, And
Its Consequences -Part II

Tyranny Of The Majority

How the principle of the sovereignty of the people is to be
understood -Impossibility of conceiving a mixed government
– The sovereign power must centre somewhere – Precau-
tions to be taken to control its action – These precautions
have not been taken in the United States – Consequences.

I hold it to be an impious and an execrable maxim that,
politically speaking, a people has a right to do whatsoever it
pleases, and yet I have asserted that all authority originates
in the will of the majority. Am I then, in contradiction with
myself?
A general law – which bears the name of Justice – has been
made and sanctioned, not only by a majority of this or that
people, but by a majority of mankind. The rights of every
people are consequently confined within the limits of what
is just. A nation may be considered in the light of a jury

which is empowered to represent society at large, and to ap-

ply the great and general law of justice. Ought such a jury,

which represents society, to have more power than the soci-

ety in which the laws it applies originate?

When I refuse to obey an unjust law, I do not contest the

right which the majority has of commanding, but I simply

appeal from the sovereignty of the people to the sovereignty

of mankind. It has been asserted that a people can never

entirely outstep the boundaries of justice and of reason in

those affairs which are more peculiarly its own, and that con-

sequently, full power may fearlessly be given to the majority

by which it is represented. But this language is that of a slave.

A majority taken collectively may be regarded as a being

whose opinions, and most frequently whose interests, are

opposed to those of another being, which is styled a minor-

ity. If it be admitted that a man, possessing absolute power,

may misuse that power by wronging his adversaries, why

should a majority not be liable to the same reproach? Men

are not apt to change their characters by agglomeration; nor

does their patience in the presence of obstacles increase with

the consciousness of their strength.* And for these reasons I

can never willingly invest any number of my fellow- crea-
tures with that unlimited authority which I should refuse to
any one of them.
I do not think that it is possible to combine several prin-
ciples in the same government, so as at the same time to
maintain freedom, and really to oppose them to one another.
The form of government which is usually termed mixed has
always appeared to me to be a mere chimera. Accurately
speaking there is no such thing as a mixed government (with
the meaning usually given to that word), because in all com-
munities some one principle of action may be discovered
which preponderates over the others. England in the last cen-
tury, which has been more especially cited as an example of
this form of Government, was in point of fact an essentially
aristocratic State, although it comprised very powerful ele-
ments of democracy; for the laws and customs of the coun-

try were such that the aristocracy could not but preponder-
ate in the end, and subject the direction of public affairs to
its own will. The error arose from too much attention being
paid to the actual struggle which was going on between the
nobles and the people, without considering the probable is-
sue of the contest, which was in reality the important point.
When a community really has a mixed government, that is
to say, when it is equally divided between two adverse prin-
ciples, it must either pass through a revolution or fall into
complete dissolution.
I am therefore of opinion that some one social power must
always be made to predominate over the others; but I think
that liberty is endangered when this power is checked by no
obstacles which may retard its course, and force it to moder-
ate its own vehemence.
Unlimited power is in itself a bad and dangerous thing;
human beings are not competent to exercise it with discre-
tion, and God alone can be omnipotent, because His wis-
dom and His justice are always equal to His power. But no
power upon earth is so worthy of honor for itself, or of rev-
erential obedience to the rights which it represents, that I

*No one will assert that a people cannot forcibly wrong an-
other people; but parties may be looked upon as lesser na-
tions within a greater one, and they are aliens to each other:
if, therefore, it be admitted that a nation can act tyrannically
towards another nation, it cannot be denied that a party may
do the same towards another party.

jority. However iniquitous or absurd the evil of which you
complain may be, you must submit to it as well as you can.*
*A striking instance of the excesses which may be occasioned by
the despotism of the majority occurred at Baltimore in the year
1812. At that time the war was very popular in Baltimore. A jour-
nal which had taken the other side of the question excited the
indignation of the inhabitants by its opposition. The populace
assembled, broke the printing-presses, and attacked the houses of
the newspaper editors. The militia was called out, but no one
obeyed the call; and the only means of saving the poor wretches
who were threatened by the frenzy of the mob was to throw them
into prison as common malefactors. But even this precaution was
ineffectual; the mob collected again during the night, the magis-
trates again made a vain attempt to call out the militia, the prison
was forced, one of the newspaper editors was killed upon the spot,
and the others were left for dead; the guilty parties were acquitted
by the jury when they were brought to trial.
I said one day to an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, “Be so good as
to explain to me how it happens that in a State founded by Quak-
ers, and celebrated for its toleration, freed blacks are not allowed
to exercise civil rights. They pay the taxes; is it not fair that they
should have a vote?”
“You insult us,” replied my informant, “if you imagine that our
legislators could have committed so gross an act of injustice and
intolerance.”
“What! then the blacks possess the right of voting in this county?”
“Without the smallest doubt.”
“How comes it, then, that at the polling-booth this morning I
did not perceive a single negro in the whole meeting?”

“This is not the fault of the law: the negroes have an undisputed
right of voting, but they voluntarily abstain from making their
appearance.”
“A very pretty piece of modesty on their parts!” rejoined I.
“Why, the truth is, that they are not disinclined to vote, but
they are afraid of being maltreated; in this country the law is some-
times unable to maintain its authority without the support of the
majority. But in this case the majority entertains very strong preju-
dices against the blacks, and the magistrates are unable to protect
them in the exercise of their legal privileges.”
“What! then the majority claims the right not only of making
the laws, but of breaking the laws it has made?”

If, on the other hand, a legislative power could be so con-
stituted as to represent the majority without necessarily be-
ing the slave of its passions; an executive, so as to retain a
certain degree of uncontrolled authority; and a judiciary, so
as to remain independent of the two other powers; a govern-
ment would be formed which would still be democratic with-
out incurring any risk of tyrannical abuse.
I do not say that tyrannical abuses frequently occur in
America at the present day, but I maintain that no sure bar-
rier is established against them, and that the causes which
mitigate the government are to be found in the circumstances
and the manners of the country more than in its laws.

Effects of the Unlimited Power of the Majority upon the
Arbitrary Authority of the American Public Officers

Liberty left by the American laws to public officers within a
certain sphere – Their power.

A distinction must be drawn between tyranny and arbitrary
power. Tyranny may be exercised by means of the law, and

are protected by the opinion, and backed by the co-opera-
tion, of the majority, they venture upon such manifestations
of their power as astonish a European. By this means habits
are formed in the heart of a free country which may some
day prove fatal to its liberties.

Power Exercised by the Majority in America upon Opin-
ion

In America, when the majority has once irrevocably decided
a question, all discussion ceases – Reason of this – Moral
power exercised by the majority upon opinion – Democratic
republics have deprived despotism of its physical instruments
– Their despotism sways the minds of men.

It is in the examination of the display of public opinion in
the United States that we clearly perceive how far the power
of the majority surpasses all the powers with which we are
acquainted in Europe. Intellectual principles exercise an in-
fluence which is so invisible, and often so inappreciable, that
they baffle the toils of oppression. At the present time the

gated abroad; for there is no country in Europe so subdued
by any single authority as not to contain citizens who are
ready to protect the man who raises his voice in the cause of
truth from the consequences of his hardihood. If he is un-
fortunate enough to live under an absolute government, the
people is upon his side; if he inhabits a free country, he may
find a shelter behind the authority of the throne, if he re-
quire one. The aristocratic part of society supports him in
some countries, and the democracy in others. But in a na-
tion where democratic institutions exist, organized like those
of the United States, there is but one sole authority, one single
element of strength and of success, with nothing beyond it.
In America the majority raises very formidable barriers to
the liberty of opinion: within these barriers an author may
write whatever he pleases, but he will repent it if he ever step
beyond them. Not that he is exposed to the terrors of an
auto-da-fe, but he is tormented by the slights and persecu-
tions of daily obloquy. His political career is closed forever,
since he has offended the only authority which is able to
promote his success. Every sort of compensation, even that
of celebrity, is refused to him. Before he published his opin-

ions he imagined that he held them in common with many
others; but no sooner has he declared them openly than he is
loudly censured by his overbearing opponents, whilst those
who think without having the courage to speak, like him,
abandon him in silence. He yields at length, oppressed by
the daily efforts he has been making, and he subsides into
silence, as if he was tormented by remorse for having spoken
the truth.
Fetters and headsmen were the coarse instruments which
tyranny formerly employed; but the civilization of our age
has refined the arts of despotism which seemed, however, to
have been sufficiently perfected before. The excesses of mo-
narchical power had devised a variety of physical means of
oppression: the democratic republics of the present day have
rendered it as entirely an affair of the mind as that will which
it is intended to coerce. Under the absolute sway of an indi-
vidual despot the body was attacked in order to subdue the
soul, and the soul escaped the blows which were directed
against it and rose superior to the attempt; but such is not
the course adopted by tyranny in democratic republics; there
the body is left free, and the soul is enslaved. The sovereign

can no longer say, “You shall think as I do on pain of death;”
but he says, “You are free to think differently from me, and
to retain your life, your property, and all that you possess;
but if such be your determination, you are henceforth an
alien among your people. You may retain your civil rights,
but they will be useless to you, for you will never be chosen
by your fellow-citizens if you solicit their suffrages, and they
will affect to scorn you if you solicit their esteem. You will
remain among men, but you will be deprived of the rights of
mankind. Your fellow-creatures will shun you like an im-
pure being, and those who are most persuaded of your inno-
cence will abandon you too, lest they should be shunned in
their turn. Go in peace! I have given you your life, but it is
an existence in comparably worse than death.”
Monarchical institutions have thrown an odium upon des-
potism; let us beware lest democratic republics should re-
store oppression, and should render it less odious and less
degrading in the eyes of the many, by making it still more
onerous to the few.
Works have been published in the proudest nations of the
Old World expressly intended to censure the vices and de-

moves the wish of publishing them. Unbelievers are to be
met with in America, but, to say the truth, there is no public
organ of infidelity. Attempts have been made by some gov-
ernments to protect the morality of nations by prohibiting
licentious books. In the United States no one is punished for
this sort of works, but no one is induced to write them; not
because all the citizens are immaculate in their manners, but
because the majority of the community is decent and or-
derly.

In these cases the advantages derived from the exercise of
this power are unquestionable, and I am simply discussing
the nature of the power itself. This irresistible authority is a
constant fact, and its judicious exercise is an accidental oc-
currence.

Effects of the Tyranny of the Majority upon the National
Character of the Americans

Effects of the tyranny of the majority more sensibly felt hith-
erto in the manners than in the conduct of society – They
check the development of leading characters – Democratic
republics organized like the United States bring the practice
of courting favor within the reach of the many – Proofs of
this spirit in the United States – Why there is more patrio-
tism in the people than in those who govern in its name.

The tendencies which I have just alluded to are as yet very
slightly perceptible in political society, but they already be-
gin to exercise an unfavorable influence upon the national
character of the Americans. I am inclined to attribute the
singular paucity of distinguished political characters to the
ever-increasing activity of the despotism of the majority in
the United States. When the American Revolution broke out
they arose in great numbers, for public opinion then served,
not to tyrannize over, but to direct the exertions of individu-
als. Those celebrated men took a full part in the general agi-

attracted by vociferation, more persons are to be met with
who speculate upon its foibles and live at the cost of its pas-
sions than in absolute monarchies. Not because men are natu-
rally worse in these States than elsewhere, but the temptation
is stronger, and of easier access at the same time. The result is
a far more extensive debasement of the characters of citizens.

Democratic republics extend the practice of currying favor
with the many, and they introduce it into a greater number
of classes at once: this is one of the most serious reproaches
that can be addressed to them. In democratic States orga-
nized on the principles of the American republics, this is
more especially the case, where the authority of the majority
is so absolute and so irresistible that a man must give up his
rights as a citizen, and almost abjure his quality as a human
being, if te intends to stray from the track which it lays down.
In that immense crowd which throngs the avenues to power
in the United States I found very few men who displayed
any of that manly candor and that masculine independence
of opinion which frequently distinguished the Americans in
former times, and which constitutes the leading feature in

among the leaders of the people. This may be explained by
analogy; despotism debases the oppressed much more than
the oppressor: in absolute monarchies the king has often great
virtues, but the courtiers are invariably servile. It is true that
the American courtiers do not say “Sire,” or “Your Majesty”
– a distinction without a difference. They are forever talking
of the natural intelligence of the populace they serve; they
do not debate the question as to which of the virtues of their
master is pre-eminently worthy of admiration, for they as-
sure him that he possesses all the virtues under heaven with-
out having acquired them, or without caring to acquire them;
they do not give him their daughters and their wives to be
raised at his pleasure to the rank of his concubines, but, by
sacrificing their opinions, they prostitute themselves. Mor-
alists and philosophers in America are not obliged to conceal
their opinions under the veil of allegory; but, before they
venture upon a harsh truth, they say, “We are aware that the
people which we are addressing is too superior to all the weak-
nesses of human nature to lose the command of its temper
for an instant; and we should not hold this language if we
were not speaking to men whom their virtues and their in-

telligence render more worthy of freedom than all the rest of
the world.” It would have been impossible for the sycophants
of Louis XIV to flatter more dexterously. For my part, I am
persuaded that in all governments, whatever their nature may
be, servility will cower to force, and adulation will cling to
power. The only means of preventing men from degrading
themselves is to invest no one with that unlimited authority
which is the surest method of debasing them.

The Greatest Dangers of the American Republics Pro-
ceed from the Unlimited Power of the Majority

Democratic republics liable to perish from a misuse of their
power, and not by impotence – The Governments of the Ameri-
can republics are more centralized and more energetic than those
of the monarchies of Europe – Dangers resulting from this –
Opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson upon this point.

Governments usually fall a sacrifice to impotence or to tyr-
anny. In the former case their power escapes from them; it is
wrested from their grasp in the latter. Many observers, who

have witnessed the anarchy of democratic States, have imag-
ined that the government of those States was naturally weak
and impotent. The truth is, that when once hostilities are
begun between parties, the government loses its control over
society. But I do not think that a democratic power is natu-
rally without force or without resources: say, rather, that it is
almost always by the abuse of its force and the
misemployment of its resources that a democratic govern-
ment fails. Anarchy is almost always produced by its tyranny
or its mistakes, but not by its want of strength.
It is important not to confound stability with force, or the
greatness of a thing with its duration. In democratic repub-
lics, the power which directs* society is not stable; for it of-
ten changes hands and assumes a new direction. But which-
ever way it turns, its force is almost irresistible. The Govern-
ments of the American republics appear to me to be as much
centralized as those of the absolute monarchies of Europe,
and more energetic than they are. I do not, therefore, imag-

ine that they will perish from weakness.*

If ever the free institutions of America are destroyed, that
event may be attributed to the unlimited authority of the
majority, which may at some future time urge the minorities
to desperation, and oblige them to have recourse to physical
force. Anarchy will then be the result, but it will have been
brought about by despotism.
Mr. Hamilton expresses the same opinion in the “Federal-
ist,” No. 51. “It is of great importance in a republic not only
to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers, but
to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the
other part. Justice is the end of government. It is the end of
civil society. It ever has been, and ever will be, pursued until
it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit. In a
society, under the forms of which the stronger faction can
readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly
be said to reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker

*This power may be centred in an assembly, in which case it
will be strong without being stable; or it may be centred in
an individual, in which case it will be less strong, but more
stable.

*I presume that it is scarcely necessary to remind the reader
here, as well as throughout the remainder of this chapter,
that I am speaking, not of the Federal Government, but of
the several governments of each State, which the majority
controls at its pleasure.

individual is not secured against the violence of the stronger:
and as in the latter state even the stronger individuals are
prompted by the uncertainty of their condition to submit to
a government which may protect the weak as well as them-
selves, so in the former state will the more powerful factions
be gradually induced by a like motive to wish for a govern-
ment which will protect all parties, the weaker as well as the
more powerful. It can be little doubted that, if the State of
Rhode Island was separated from the Confederacy and left
to itself, the insecurity of right under the popular form of
government within such narrow limits would be displayed
by such reiterated oppressions of the factious majorities, that
some power altogether independent of the people would soon
be called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule
had proved the necessity of it.”
Jefferson has also thus expressed himself in a letter to Madi-
son:* “The executive power in our Government is not the
only, perhaps not even the principal, object of my solicitude.
The tyranny of the Legislature is really the danger most to
be feared, and will continue to be so for many years to come.

The tyranny of the executive power will come in its turn,
but at a more distant period.” I am glad to cite the opinion
of Jefferson upon this subject rather than that of another,
because I consider him to be the most powerful advocate
democracy has ever sent forth.

Chapter Summary

The national majority does not pretend to conduct all busi-
ness – Is obliged to employ the town and county magistrates
to execute its supreme decisions.

I have already pointed out the distinction which is to be
made between a centralized government and a centralized
administration. The former exists in America, but the latter
is nearly unknown there. If the directing power of the Ameri-
can communities had both these instruments of government
at its disposal, and united the habit of executing its own com-

ously subsisted, and the effects of a centralized administra-
tion had sunk deep into the habits and the laws of the people,
I do not hesitate to assert, that in that country a more insuf-
ferable despotism would prevail than any which now exists
in the monarchical States of Europe, or indeed than any which
could be found on this side of the confines of Asia.

The Profession of the Law in the United States Serves to
Counterpoise the Democracy

Utility of discriminating the natural propensities of the mem-
bers of the legal profession – These men called upon to act a
prominent part in future society -In what manner the pecu-
liar pursuits of lawyers give an aristocratic turn to their ideas
-Accidental causes which may check this tendency – Ease
with which the aristocracy coalesces with legal men – Use of
lawyers to a despot – The profession of the law constitutes
the only aristocratic element with which the natural elements
of democracy will combine – Peculiar causes which tend to
give an aristocratic turn of mind to the English and Ameri-
can lawyers – The aristocracy of America is on the bench

and at the bar – Influence of lawyers upon American society
– Their peculiar magisterial habits affect the legislature, the
administration, and even the people.

In visiting the Americans and in studying their laws we per-
ceive that the authority they have entrusted to members of
the legal profession, and the influence which these individu-
als exercise in the Government, is the most powerful existing
security against the excesses of democracy. This effect seems
to me to result from a general cause which it is useful to
investigate, since it may produce analogous consequences
elsewhere.
The members of the legal profession have taken an impor-
tant part in all the vicissitudes of political society in Europe
during the last five hundred years. At one time they have
been the instruments of those who were invested with po-
litical authority, and at another they have succeeded in con-
verting political authorities into their instrument. In the
Middle Ages they afforded a powerful support to the Crown,
and since that period they have exerted themselves to the
utmost to limit the royal prerogative. In England they have

readily, and assume, as it were, the consistency of a single
order of family interests.
I am, in like manner, inclined to believe that a monarch
will always be able to convert legal practitioners into the most
serviceable instruments of his authority. There is a far greater
affinity between this class of individuals and the executive
power than there is between them and the people; just as
there is a greater natural affinity between the nobles and the
monarch than between the nobles and the people, although
the higher orders of society have occasionally resisted the
prerogative of the Crown in concert with the lower classes.
Lawyers are attached to public order beyond every other
consideration, and the best security of public order is au-
thority. It must not be forgotten that, if they prize the free
institutions of their country much, they nevertheless value
the legality of those institutions far more: they are less afraid
of tyranny than of arbitrary power; and provided that the
legislature take upon itself to deprive men of their indepen-
dence, they are not dissatisfied.
I am therefore convinced that the prince who, in presence
of an encroaching democracy, should endeavor to impair the

judicial authority in his dominions, and to diminish the po-
litical influence of lawyers, would commit a great mistake.
He would let slip the substance of authority to grasp at the
shadow. He would act more wisely in introducing men con-
nected with the law into the government; and if he entrusted
them with the conduct of a despotic power, bearing some
marks of violence, that power would most likely assume the
external features of justice and of legality in their hands.

The government of democracy is favorable to the political
power of lawyers; for when the wealthy, the noble, and the
prince are excluded from the government, they are sure to
occupy the highest stations, in their own right, as it were,
since they are the only men of information and sagacity, be-
yond the sphere of the people, who can be the object of the
popular choice. If, then, they are led by their tastes to com-
bine with the aristocracy and to support the Crown, they are
naturally brought into contact with the people by their in-
terests. They like the government of democracy, without
participating in its propensities and without imitating its
weaknesses; whence they derive a twofold authority, from it

time if the influence of lawyers in public business did not
increase in proportion to the power of the people.
This aristocratic character, which I hold to be common to
the legal profession, is much more distinctly marked in the
United States and in England than in any other country.
This proceeds not only from the legal studies of the English
and American lawyers, but from the nature of the legisla-
tion, and the position which those persons occupy in the
two countries. The English and the Americans have retained
the law of precedents; that is to say, they continue to found
their legal opinions and the decisions of their courts upon
the opinions and the decisions of their forefathers. In the
mind of an English or American lawyer a taste and a rever-
ence for what is old is almost always united to a love of regu-
lar and lawful proceedings.
This predisposition has another effect upon the character
of the legal profession and upon the general course of soci-
ety. The English and American lawyers investigate what has
been done; the French advocate inquires what should have
been done; the former produce precedents, the latter rea-
sons. A French observer is surprised to hear how often an

tion, which adds a conservative interest to their natural taste
for public order. If I were asked where I place the American
aristocracy, I should reply without hesitation that it is not
composed of the rich, who are united together by no com-
mon tie, but that it occupies the judicial bench and the bar.
The more we reflect upon all that occurs in the United
States the more shall we be persuaded that the lawyers as a
body form the most powerful, if not the only, counterpoise
to the democratic element. In that country we perceive how
eminently the legal profession is qualified by its powers, and
even by its defects, to neutralize the vices which are inherent
in popular government. When the American people is in-
toxicated by passion, or carried away by the impetuosity of
its ideas, it is checked and stopped by the almost invisible
influence of its legal counsellors, who secretly oppose their
aristocratic propensities to its democratic instincts, their su-
perstitious attachment to what is antique to its love of nov-
elty, their narrow views to its immense designs, and their
habitual procrastination to its ardent impatience.
The courts of justice are the most visible organs by which
the legal profession is enabled to control the democracy. The

judge is a lawyer, who, independently of the taste for regu-
larity and order which he has contracted in the study of leg-
islation, derives an additional love of stability from his own
inalienable functions. His legal attainments have already
raised him to a distinguished rank amongst his fellow-citi-
zens; his political power completes the distinction of his sta-
tion, and gives him the inclinations natural to privileged
classes.
Armed with the power of declaring the laws to be uncon-
stitutional,* the American magistrate perpetually interferes
in political affairs. He cannot force the people to make laws,
but at least he can oblige it not to disobey its own enact-
ments; or to act inconsistently with its own principles. I am
aware that a secret tendency to diminish the judicial power
exists in the United States, and by most of the constitutions
of the several States the Government can, upon the demand
of the two houses of the legislature, remove the judges from
their station. By some other constitutions the members of
the tribunals are elected, and they are even subjected to fre-
quent re-elections. I venture to predict that these innova-

*See chapter VI. on the “Judicial Power in the United States.”

in matters of civil law the majority is obliged to defer to the
authority of the legal profession, and that the American law-
yers are disinclined to innovate when they are left to their
own choice.
It is curious for a Frenchman, accustomed to a very differ-
ent state of things, to hear the perpetual complaints which
are made in the United States against the stationary propen-
sities of legal men, and their prejudices in favor of existing
institutions.
The influence of the legal habits which are common in
America extends beyond the limits I have just pointed out.
Scarcely any question arises in the United States which does
not become, sooner or later, a subject of judicial debate; hence
all parties are obliged to borrow the ideas, and even the lan-
guage, usual in judicial proceedings in their daily controver-
sies. As most public men are, or have been, legal practitio-
ners, they introduce the customs and technicalities of their
profession into the affairs of the country. The jury extends
this habitude to all classes. The language of the law thus
becomes, in some measure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit of the
law, which is produced in the schools and courts of justice,

gradually penetrates beyond their walls into the bosom of
society, where it descends to the lowest classes, so that the
whole people contracts the habits and the tastes of the mag-
istrate. The lawyers of the United States form a party which
is but little feared and scarcely perceived, which has no badge
peculiar to itself, which adapts itself with great flexibility to
the exigencies of the time, and accommodates itself to all the
movements of the social body; but this party extends over
the whole community, and it penetrates into all classes of
society; it acts upon the country imperceptibly, but it finally
fashions it to suit its purposes.

Trial by Jury in the United States Considered as a Politi-
cal Institution

Trial by jury, which is one of the instruments of the sover-
eignty of the people, deserves to be compared with the other
laws which establish that sovereignty – Composition of the
jury in the United States – Effect of trial by jury upon the
national character – It educates the people – It tends to es-
tablish the authority of the magistrates and to extend a knowl-
edge of law among the people.

Since I have been led by my subject to recur to the adminis-
tration of justice in the United States, I will not pass over
this point without adverting to the institution of the jury.
Trial by jury may be considered in two separate points of
view, as a judicial and as a political institution. If it entered
into my present purpose to inquire how far trial by jury (more
especially in civil cases) contributes to insure the best ad-

ministration of justice, I admit that its utility might be con-
tested. As the jury was first introduced at a time when soci-
ety was in an uncivilized state, and when courts of justice
were merely called upon to decide on the evidence of facts, it
is not an easy task to adapt it to the wants of a highly civi-
lized community when the mutual relations of men are mul-
tiplied to a surprising extent, and have assumed the enlight-
ened and intellectual character of the age.*

My present object is to consider the jury as a political in-
stitution, and any other course would divert me from my
subject. Of trial by jury, considered as a judicial institution,
I shall here say but very few words. When the English adopted
trial by jury they were a semi-barbarous people; they are be-
*The investigation of trial by jury as a judicial institution,
and the appreciation of its effects in the United States, to-
gether with the advantages the Americans have derived from
it, would suffice to form a book, and a book upon a very
useful and curious subject. The State of Louisiana would in
particular afford the curious phenomenon of a French and
English legislation, as well as a French and English popula-
tion, which are gradually combining with each other. See
the “Digeste des Lois de la Louisiane,” in two volumes; and
the “Traite sur les Regles des Actions civiles,” printed in
French and English at New Orleans in 1830.

come, in course of time, one of the most enlightened na-
tions of the earth; and their attachment to this institution
seems to have increased with their increasing cultivation. They
soon spread beyond their insular boundaries to every corner
of the habitable globe; some have formed colonies, others
independent states; the mother-country has maintained its
monarchical constitution; many of its offspring have founded
powerful republics; but wherever the English have been they
have boasted of the privilege of trial by jury.* They have es-
tablished it, or hastened to re-establish it, in all their settle-
ments. A judicial institution which obtains the suffrages of a
great people for so long a series of ages, which is zealously
renewed at every epoch of civilization, in all the climates of
the earth and under every form of human government, can-
not be contrary to the spirit of justice.**
*All the English and American jurists are unanimous upon
this head. Mr. Story, judge of the Supreme Court of the United
States, speaks, in his “Treatise on the Federal Constitution,”
of the advantages of trial by jury in civil cases: – “ The inesti-
mable privilege of a trial by jury in civil cases -a privilege scarcely
inferior to that in criminal cases, which is counted by all per-
sons to be essential to political and civil liberty… .” (Story,
book iii., chap. xxxviii.)

**If it were our province to point out the utility of the jury
as a judicial institution in this place, much might be said,
and the following arguments might be brought forward
amongst others: –
By introducing the jury into the business of the courts you
are enabled to diminish the number of judges, which is a
very great advantage. When judges are very numerous, death
is perpetually thinning the ranks of the judicial functionar-
ies, and laying places vacant for newcomers. The ambition
of the magistrates is therefore continually excited, and they
are naturally made dependent upon the will of the majority,
or the individual who fills up the vacant appointments; the
officers of the court then rise like the officers of an army.
This state of things is entirely contrary to the sound admin-
istration of justice, and to the intentions of the legislator.
The office of a judge is made inalienable in order that he
may remain independent: but of what advantage is it that
his independence should be protected if he be tempted to
sacrifice it of his own accord? When judges are very numer-
ous many of them must necessarily be incapable of perform-
ing their important duties, for a great magistrate is a man of
no common powers; and I am inclined to believe that a half-
enlightened tribunal is the worst of all instruments for at-
taining those objects which it is the purpose of courts of
justice to accomplish. For my own part, I had rather submit
the decision of a case to ignorant jurors directed by a skilful
judge than to judges a majority of whom are imperfectly
acquainted with jurisprudence and with the laws.

be able to crush its enemies upon a field of battle would very
soon be destroyed. The true sanction of political laws is to be
found in penal legislation, and if that sanction be wanting the
law will sooner or later lose its cogency. He who punishes in-
fractions of the law is therefore the real master of society. Now
the institution of the jury raises the people itself, or at least a
class of citizens, to the bench of judicial authority. The institu-
tion of the jury consequently invests the people, or that class
of citizens, with the direction of society.*

In England the jury is returned from the aristocratic por-
tion of the nation;** the aristocracy makes the laws, applies
*An important remark must, however, be made. Trial by jury
does unquestionably invest the people with a general control
over the actions of citizens, but it does not furnish means of
exercising this control in all cases, or with an absolute au-
thority. When an absolute monarch has the right of trying
offences by his representatives, the fate of the prisoner is, as
it were, decided beforehand. But even if the people were pre-
disposed to convict, the composition and the non-responsi-
bility of the jury would still afford some chances favorable to
the protection of innocence.
**This may be true to some extent of special juries, but not
of common juries. The author seems not to have been aware
that the qualifications of jurors in England vary exceedingly.

the laws, and punishes all infractions of the laws; everything
is established upon a consistent footing, and England may
with truth be said to constitute an aristocratic republic. In
the United States the same system is applied to the whole
people. Every American citizen is qualified to be an elector, a
juror, and is eligible to office.* The system of the jury, as it is
understood in America, appears to me to be as direct and as
extreme a consequence of the sovereignty of the people as
universal suffrage. These institutions are two instruments of
equal power, which contribute to the supremacy of the ma-
jority. All the sovereigns who have chosen to govern by their
own authority, and to direct society instead of obeying its
directions, have destroyed or enfeebled the institution of the
jury. The monarchs of the House of Tudor sent to prison
jurors who refused to convict, and Napoleon caused them to
be returned by his agents.
However clear most of these truths may seem to be, they
do not command universal assent, and in France, at least,
the institution of trial by jury is still very imperfectly under-
stood. If the question arises as to the proper qualification of

*See Appendix, Q.

ence is prodigiously increased when it is introduced into civil
causes. The jury, and more especially the jury in civil cases,
serves to communicate the spirit of the judges to the minds
of all the citizens; and this spirit, with the habits which at-
tend it, is the soundest preparation for free institutions. It
imbues all classes with a respect for the thing judged, and
with the notion of right. If these two elements be removed,
the love of independence is reduced to a mere destructive
passion. It teaches men to practice equity, every man learns
to judge his neighbor as he would himself be judged; and
this is especially true of the jury in civil causes, for, whilst the
number of persons who have reason to apprehend a criminal
prosecution is small, every one is liable to have a civil action
brought against him. The jury teaches every man not to re-
coil before the responsibility of his own actions, and im-
presses him with that manly confidence without which po-
litical virtue cannot exist. It invests each citizen with a kind
of magistracy, it makes them all feel the duties which they
are bound to discharge towards society, and the part which
they take in the Government. By obliging men to turn their
attention to affairs which are not exclusively their own, it

called upon to solve, and he puts the answer to the question
of law into their mouths. His influence upon their verdict is
almost unlimited.
If I am called upon to explain why I am but little moved
by the arguments derived from the ignorance of jurors in
civil causes, I reply, that in these proceedings, whenever the
question to be solved is not a mere question of fact, the jury
has only the semblance of a judicial body. The jury sanctions
the decision of the judge, they by the authority of society
which they represent, and he by that of reason and of law.*

In England and in America the judges exercise an influ-
ence upon criminal trials which the French judges have never
possessed. The reason of this difference may easily be dis-
covered; the English and American magistrates establish their
authority in civil causes, and only transfer it afterwards to
tribunals of another kind, where that authority was not ac-
quired. In some cases (and they are frequently the most im-
portant ones) the American judges have the right of decid-
ing causes alone.** Upon these occasions they are acciden-

tally placed in the position which the French judges habitu-
ally occupy, but they are invested with far more power than
the latter; they are still surrounded by the reminiscence of the
jury, and their judgment has almost as much authority as the
voice of the community at large, represented by that institu-
tion. Their influence extends beyond the limits of the courts;
in the recreations of private life as well as in the turmoil of
public business, abroad and in the legislative assemblies, the
American judge is constantly surrounded by men who are ac-
customed to regard his intelligence as superior to their own,
and after having exercised his power in the decision of causes,
he continues to influence the habits of thought and the char-
acters of the individuals who took a part in his judgment.
The jury, then, which seems to restrict the rights of magis-
tracy, does in reality consolidate its power, and in no country
are the judges so powerful as there, where the people partakes
their privileges. It is more especially by means of the jury in
civil causes that the American magistrates imbue all classes of
society with the spirit of their profession. Thus the jury, which
is the most energetic means of making the people rule, is also
the most efficacious means of teaching it to rule well.

*See Appendix, R.
**The Federal judges decide upon their own authority al-
most all the questions most important to the country.

Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining the
Democratic Republic – Part I

Principal Causes Which Tend to Maintain the Demo-
cratic Republic in the United States

A democratic republic subsists in the United States, and the
principal object of this book has been to account for the fact
of its existence. Several of the causes which contribute to
maintain the institutions of America have been involuntarily
passed by or only hinted at as I was borne along by my sub-
ject. Others I have been unable to discuss, and those on which
I have dwelt most are, as it were, buried in the details of the
former parts of this work. I think, therefore, that before I
proceed to speak of the future, I cannot do better than col-
lect within a small compass the reasons which best explain
the present. In this retrospective chapter I shall be succinct,
for I shall take care to remind the reader very summarily of
what he already knows; and I shall only select the most promi-
nent of those facts which I have not yet pointed out.
All the causes which contribute to the maintenance of the

democratic republic in the United States are reducible to three
heads: –

I. The peculiar and accidental situation in which Providence
has placed the Americans.

II. The laws.

III. The manners and customs of the people.

Accidental Or Providential Causes Which Contribute To The
Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic In The United
States The Union has no neighbors – No metropolis – The
Americans have had the chances of birth in their favor –
America an empty country – How this circumstance con-
tributes powerfully to the maintenance of the democratic
republic in America – How the American wilds are peopled
– Avidity of the Anglo-Americans in taking possession of
the solitudes of the New World – Influence of physical pros-
perity upon the political opinions of the Americans.

under the walls of New Orleans, a victory which was, how-
ever, a very ordinary achievement, and which could only be
remembered in a country where battles are rare. Now the
people which is thus carried away by the illusions of glory is
unquestionably the most cold and calculating, the most un-
military (if I may use the expression), and the most prosaic
of all the peoples of the earth.
America has no great capital* city, whose influence is

*The United States have no metropolis, but they already
contain several very large cities. Philadelphia reckoned
161,000 inhabitants and New York 202,000 in the year 1830.
The lower orders which inhabit these cities constitute a rabble
even more formidable than the populace of European towns.
They consist of freed blacks in the first place, who are con-
demned by the laws and by public opinion to a hereditary
state of misery and degradation. They also contain a multi-
tude of Europeans who have been driven to the shores of the
New World by their misfortunes or their misconduct; and
these men inoculate the United States with all our vices, with-
out bringing with them any of those interests which coun-
teract their baneful influence. As inhabitants of a country
where they have no civil rights, they are ready to turn all the
passions which agitate the community to their own advan-
tage; thus, within the last few months serious riots have bro-
ken out in Philadelphia and in New York. Disturbances of

this kind are unknown in the rest of the country, which is
nowise alarmed by them, because the population of the cit-
ies has hitherto exercised neither power nor influence over
the rural districts. Nevertheless, I look upon the size of cer-
tain American cities, and especially on the nature of their
population, as a real danger which threatens the future secu-
rity of the democratic republics of the New World; and I
venture to predict that they will perish from this circum-
stance unless the government succeeds in creating an armed
force, which, whilst it remains under the control of the ma-
jority of the nation, will be independent of the town popula-
tion, and able to repress its excesses.
The population of the city of New York had risen, in 1870,
to 942,292, and that of Philadelphia to 674,022. Brooklyn,
which may be said to form part of New York city, has a popu-
lation of 396,099, in addition to that of New York. The fre-
quent disturbances in the great cities of America, and the
excessive corruption of their local governments – over which
there is no effectual control – are amongst the greatest evils
and dangers of the country.

directly or indirectly felt over the whole extent of the coun-
try, which I hold to be one of the first causes of the mainte-
nance of republican institutions in the United States. In cit-
ies men cannot be prevented from concerting together, and
from awakening a mutual excitement which prompts sud-
den and passionate resolutions. Cities may be looked upon
as large assemblies, of which all the inhabitants are mem-
bers; their populace exercises a prodigious influence upon
the magistrates, and frequently executes its own wishes with-
out their intervention.
To subject the provinces to the metropolis is therefore not
only to place the destiny of the empire in the hands of a
portion of the community, which may be reprobated as un-
just, but to place it in the hands of a populace acting under
its own impulses, which must be avoided as dangerous. The
preponderance of capital cities is therefore a serious blow
upon the representative system, and it exposes modern re-
publics to the same defect as the republics of antiquity, which
all perished from not having been acquainted with that form
of government.
It would be easy for me to adduce a great number of sec-

ondary causes which have contributed to establish, and which
concur to maintain, the democratic republic of the United
States. But I discern two principal circumstances amongst
these favorable elements, which I hasten to point out. I have
already observed that the origin of the American settlements
may be looked upon as the first and most efficacious cause
to which the present prosperity of the United States may be
attributed. The Americans had the chances of birth in their
favor, and their forefathers imported that equality of condi-
tions into the country whence the democratic republic has
very naturally taken its rise. Nor was this all they did; for
besides this republican condition of society, the early settler
bequeathed to their descendants those customs, manners,
and opinions which contribute most to the success of a re-
publican form of government. When I reflect upon the con-
sequences of this primary circumstance, methinks I see the
destiny of America embodied in the first Puritan who landed
on those shores, just as the human race was represented by
the first man.
The chief circumstance which has favored the establish-
ment and the maintenance of a democratic republic in the

founded in the midst of hostile nations, which they were
obliged to subjugate before they could flourish in their place.
Even the moderns have found, in some parts of South
America, vast regions inhabited by a people of inferior civili-
zation, but which occupied and cultivated the soil. To found
their new states it was necessary to extirpate or to subdue a
numerous population, until civilization has been made to
blush for their success. But North America was only inhab-
ited by wandering tribes, who took no thought of the natu-
ral riches of the soil, and that vast country was still, properly
speaking, an empty continent, a desert land awaiting its in-
habitants.
Everything is extraordinary in America, the social condi-
tion of the inhabitants, as well as the laws; but the soil upon
which these institutions are founded is more extraordinary
than all the rest. When man was first placed upon the earth
by the Creator, the earth was inexhaustible in its youth, but
man was weak and ignorant; and when he had learned to
explore the treasures which it contained, hosts of his fellow
creatures covered its surface, and he was obliged to earn an
asylum for repose and for freedom by the sword. At that

the solitudes of the New World. Millions of men are march-
ing at once towards the same horizon; their language, their
religion, their manners differ, their object is the same. The
gifts of fortune are promised in the West, and to the West
they bend their course.*

No event can be compared with this continuous removal
of the human race, except perhaps those irruptions which
preceded the fall of the Roman Empire. Then, as well as
now, generations of men were impelled forwards in the same
direction to meet and struggle on the same spot; but the
designs of Providence were not the same; then, every new-
comer was the harbinger of destruction and of death; now,
every adventurer brings with him the elements of prosperity
and of life. The future still conceals from us the ulterior con-
sequences of this emigration of the Americans towards the
West; but we can readily apprehend its more immediate re-
sults. As a portion of the inhabitants annually leave the States
*The number of foreign immigrants into the United States
in the last fifty years (from 1820 to 1871) is stated to be
7,556,007. Of these, 4,104,553 spoke English – that is, they
came from Great Britain, Ireland, or the British colonies;
2,643,069 came from Germany or northern Europe; and
about half a million from the south of Europe.

in which they were born, the population of these States in-
creases very slowly, although they have long been established:
thus in Connecticut, which only contains fifty-nine inhabit-
ants to the square mile, the population has not increased by
more than one-quarter in forty years, whilst that of England
has been augmented by one-third in the lapse of the same
period. The European emigrant always lands, therefore, in a
country which is but half full, and where hands are in re-
quest: he becomes a workman in easy circumstances; his son
goes to seek his fortune in unpeopled regions, and he be-
comes a rich landowner. The former amasses the capital which
the latter invests, and the stranger as well as the native is
unacquainted with want.
The laws of the United States are extremely favorable to
the division of property; but a cause which is more powerful
than the laws prevents property from being divided to ex-
cess.* This is very perceptible in the States which are begin-
ning to be thickly peopled; Massachusetts is the most popu-
lous part of the Union, but it contains only eighty inhabit-
ants to the square mile, which is must less than in France,

where 162 are reckoned to the same extent of country. But
in Massachusetts estates are very rarely divided; the eldest
son takes the land, and the others go to seek their fortune in
the desert. The law has abolished the rights of primogeni-
ture, but circumstances have concurred to re-establish it un-
der a form of which none can complain, and by which no
just rights are impaired.
A single fact will suffice to show the prodigious number of
individuals who leave New England, in this manner, to settle
themselves in the wilds. We were assured in 1830 that thirty-
six of the members of Congress were born in the little State
of Connecticut. The population of Connecticut, which con-
stitutes only one forty-third part of that of the United States,
thus furnished one-eighth of the whole body of representa-
tives. The States of Connecticut, however, only sends five
delegates to Congress; and the thirty-one others sit for the
new Western States. If these thirty-one individuals had re-
mained in Connecticut, it is probable that instead of be-
coming rich landowners they would have remained humble
laborers, that they would have lived in obscurity without
being able to rise into public life, and that, far from becom-
*In New England the estates are exceedingly small, but they
are rarely subjected to further division.

ing useful members of the legislature, they might have been
unruly citizens.
These reflections do not escape the observation of the
Americans any more than of ourselves. “It cannot be
doubted,” says Chancellor Kent in his “Treatise on Ameri-
can Law,” “that the division of landed estates must produce
great evils when it is carried to such excess as that each parcel
of land is insufficient to support a family; but these disad-
vantages have never been felt in the United States, and many
generations must elapse before they can be felt. The extent
of our inhabited territory, the abundance of adjacent land,
and the continual stream of emigration flowing from the
shores of the Atlantic towards the interior of the country,
suffice as yet, and will long suffice, to prevent the parcelling
out of estates.”
It is difficult to describe the rapacity with which the Ameri-
can rushes forward to secure the immense booty which for-
tune proffers to him. In the pursuit he fearlessly braves the
arrow of the Indian and the distempers of the forest; he is
unimpressed by the silence of the woods; the approach of
beasts of prey does not disturb him; for he is goaded on-

wards by a passion more intense than the love of life. Before
him lies a boundless continent, and he urges onwards as if
time pressed, and he was afraid of finding no room for his
exertions. I have spoken of the emigration from the older
States, but how shall I describe that which takes place from
the more recent ones? Fifty years have scarcely elapsed since
that of Ohio was founded; the greater part of its inhabitants
were not born within its confines; its capital has only been
built thirty years, and its territory is still covered by an im-
mense extent of uncultivated fields; nevertheless the popula-
tion of Ohio is already proceeding westward, and most of
the settlers who descend to the fertile savannahs of Illinois
are citizens of Ohio. These men left their first country to
improve their condition; they quit their resting-place to
ameliorate it still more; fortune awaits them everywhere, but
happiness they cannot attain. The desire of prosperity is be-
come an ardent and restless passion in their minds which
grows by what it gains. They early broke the ties which bound
them to their natal earth, and they have contracted no fresh
ones on their way. Emigration was at first necessary to them
as a means of subsistence; and it soon becomes a sort of game

of chance, which they pursue for the emotions it excites as
much as for the gain it procures.
Sometimes the progress of man is so rapid that the desert
reappears behind him. The woods stoop to give him a pas-
sage, and spring up again when he has passed. It is not un-
common in crossing the new States of the West to meet with
deserted dwellings in the midst of the wilds; the traveller
frequently discovers the vestiges of a log house in the most
solitary retreats, which bear witness to the power, and no less
to the inconstancy of man. In these abandoned fields, and
over these ruins of a day, the primeval forest soon scatters a
fresh vegetation, the beasts resume the haunts which were
once their own, and Nature covers the traces of man’s path
with branches and with flowers, which obliterate his evanes-
cent track.
I remember that, in crossing one of the woodland districts
which still cover the State of New York, I reached the shores
of a lake embosomed in forests coeval with the world. A small
island, covered with woods whose thick foliage concealed its
banks, rose from the centre of the waters. Upon the shores
of the lake no object attested the presence of man except a

thy than to exchange the pure and homely pleasures which
even the poor man tastes in his own country for the dull
delights of prosperity under a foreign sky; to leave the patri-
monial hearth and the turf beneath which his forefathers
sleep; in short, to abandon the living and the dead in quest
of fortune.
At the present time America presents a field for human
effort far more extensive than any sum of labor which can be
applied to work it. In America too much knowledge cannot
be diffused; for all knowledge, whilst it may serve him who
possesses it, turns also to the advantage of those who are
without it. New wants are not to be feared, since they can be
satisfied without difficulty; the growth of human passions
need not be dreaded, since all passions may find an easy and
a legitimate object; nor can men be put in possession of too
much freedom, since they are scarcely ever tempted to mis-
use their liberties.
The American republics of the present day are like compa-
nies of adventurers formed to explore in common the waste
lands of the New World, and busied in a flourishing trade.
The passions which agitate the Americans most deeply are

incident disperses the clouds of doubt; I was poor, I become
rich, and I am not to expect that prosperity will act upon my
conduct, and leave my judgment free; my opinions change
with my fortune, and the happy circumstances which I turn
to my advantage furnish me with that decisive argument
which was before wanting. The influence of prosperity acts
still more freely upon the American than upon strangers.
The American has always seen the connection of public or-
der and public prosperity, intimately united as they are, go
on before his eyes; he does not conceive that one can subsist
without the other; he has therefore nothing to forget; nor
has he, like so many Europeans, to unlearn the lessons of his
early education.

Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining the Demo-
cratic Republic – Part II

Influence of the Laws upon the Maintenance of the
Democratic Republic in the United States

Three principal causes of the maintenance of the democratic
republic – Federal Constitutions – Municipal institutions -
Judicial power.

The principal aim of this book has been to make known the
laws of the United States; if this purpose has been accom-
plished, the reader is already enabled to judge for himself
which are the laws that really tend to maintain the demo-
cratic republic, and which endanger its existence. If I have
not succeeded in explaining this in the whole course of my
work, I cannot hope to do so within the limits of a single
chapter. It is not my intention to retrace the path I have
already pursued, and a very few lines will suffice to recapitu-
late what I have previously explained.

Three circumstances seem to me to contribute most power-
fully to the maintenance of the democratic republic in the
United States.
The first is that Federal form of Government which the
Americans have adopted, and which enables the Union to
combine the power of a great empire with the security of a
small State.
The second consists in those municipal institutions which
limit the despotism of the majority, and at the same time
impart a taste for freedom and a knowledge of the art of
being free to the people.
The third is to be met with in the constitution of the judi-
cial power. I have shown in what manner the courts of jus-
tice serve to repress the excesses of democracy, and how they
check and direct the impulses of the majority without stop-
ping its activity.

Influence of Manners upon the Maintenance of the
Democratic Republic in the United States

I have previously remarked that the manners of the people
may be considered as one of the general causes to which the
maintenance of a democratic republic in the United States is
attributable. I here used the word manners with the mean-
ing which the ancients attached to the word mores, for I
apply it not only to manners in their proper sense of what
constitutes the character of social intercourse, but I extend it
to the various notions and opinions current among men,
and to the mass of those ideas which constitute their charac-
ter of mind. I comprise, therefore, under this term the whole
moral and intellectual condition of a people. My intention
is not to draw a picture of American manners, but simply to
point out such features of them as are favorable to the main-
tenance of political institutions.

Religion Considered as a Political Institution, Which
Powerfully Contributes to the Maintenance of the
Democratic Republic Amongst the Americans

North America peopled by men who professed a democratic
and republican Christianity – Arrival of the Catholics – For
what reason the Catholics form the most democratic and
the most republican class at the present time.

Every religion is to be found in juxtaposition to a political
opinion which is connected with it by affinity. If the human
mind be left to follow its own bent, it will regulate the tem-
poral and spiritual institutions of society upon one uniform
principle; and man will endeavor, if I may use the expres-
sion, to harmonize the state in which he lives upon earth
with the state which he believes to await him in heaven. The
greatest part of British America was peopled by men who,
after having shaken off the authority of the Pope, acknowl-
edged no other religious supremacy; they brought with them
into the New World a form of Christianity which I cannot
better describe than by styling it a democratic and republi-

can religion. This sect contributed powerfully to the estab-
lishment of a democracy and a republic, and from the earli-
est settlement of the emigrants politics and religion contracted
an alliance which has never been dissolved.
About fifty years ago Ireland began to pour a Catholic
population into the United States; on the other hand, the
Catholics of America made proselytes, and at the present
moment more than a million of Christians professing the
truths of the Church of Rome are to be met with in the
Union.* The Catholics are faithful to the observances of their
religion; they are fervent and zealous in the support and be-
lief of their doctrines. Nevertheless they constitute the most
republican and the most democratic class of citizens which
exists in the United States; and although this fact may sur-
prise the observer at first, the causes by which it is occa-
sioned may easily be discovered upon reflection.
*It is difficult to ascertain with accuracy the amount of the Ro-
man Catholic population of the United States, but in 1868 an
able writer in the “Edinburgh Review” (vol. cxxvii. p. 521) af-
firmed that the whole Catholic population of the United States
was then about 4,000,000, divided into 43 dioceses, with 3,795
churches, under the care of 45 bishops and 2,317 clergymen. But
this rapid increase is mainly supported by immigration from the
Catholic countries of Europe.

Catholicism is like an absolute monarchy; if the sovereign
be removed, all the other classes of society are more equal than
they are in republics. It has not unfrequently occurred that the
Catholic priest has left the service of the altar to mix with the
governing powers of society, and to take his place amongst the
civil gradations of men. This religious influence has some-
times been used to secure the interests of that political state of
things to which he belonged. At other times Catholics have
taken the side of aristocracy from a spirit of religion.
But no sooner is the priesthood entirely separated from
the government, as is the case in the United States, than is
found that no class of men are more naturally disposed than
the Catholics to transfuse the doctrine of the equality of con-
ditions into the political world. If, then, the Catholic citi-
zens of the United States are not forcibly led by the nature of
their tenets to adopt democratic and republican principles,
at least they are not necessarily opposed to them; and their
social position, as well as their limited number, obliges them
to adopt these opinions. Most of the Catholics are poor, and
they have no chance of taking a part in the government un-
less it be open to all the citizens. They constitute a minority,

had been called for the purpose of assisting the Poles, and of
sending them supplies of arms and money. I found two or
three thousand persons collected in a vast hall which had
been prepared to receive them. In a short time a priest in his
ecclesiastical robes advanced to the front of the hustings: the
spectators rose, and stood uncovered, whilst he spoke in the
following terms: –
“Almighty God! the God of Armies! Thou who didst
strengthen the hearts and guide the arms of our fathers when
they were fighting for the sacred rights of national indepen-
dence; Thou who didst make them triumph over a hateful
oppression, and hast granted to our people the benefits of
liberty and peace; Turn, O Lord, a favorable eye upon the
other hemisphere; pitifully look down upon that heroic na-
tion which is even now struggling as we did in the former
time, and for the same rights which we defended with our
blood. Thou, who didst create Man in the likeness of the
same image, let not tyranny mar Thy work, and establish
inequality upon the earth. Almighty God! do Thou watch
over the destiny of the Poles, and render them worthy to be
free. May Thy wisdom direct their councils, and may Thy

strength sustain their arms! Shed forth Thy terror over their
enemies, scatter the powers which take counsel against them;
and vouchsafe that the injustice which the world has wit-
nessed for fifty years, be not consummated in our time. O
Lord, who holdest alike the hearts of nations and of men in
Thy powerful hand; raise up allies to the sacred cause of right;
arouse the French nation from the apathy in which its rulers
retain it, that it go forth again to fight for the liberties of the
world.
“Lord, turn not Thou Thy face from us, and grant that we
may always be the most religious as well as the freest people
of the earth. Almighty God, hear our supplications this day.
Save the Poles, we beseech Thee, in the name of Thy well-
beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who died upon the cross
for the salvation of men. Amen.”
The whole meeting responded “Amen!” with devotion.

Indirect Influence of Religious Opinions upon Political
Society in the United States

Christian morality common to all sects – Influence of reli-
gion upon the manners of the Americans – Respect for the
marriage tie – In what manner religion confines the imagi-
nation of the Americans within certain limits, and checks
the passion of innovation – Opinion of the Americans on
the political utility of religion – Their exertions to extend
and secure its predominance.

I have just shown what the direct influence of religion upon
politics is in the United States, but its indirect influence ap-
pears to me to be still more considerable, and it never in-
structs the Americans more fully in the art of being free than
when it says nothing of freedom.
The sects which exist in the United States are innumer-
able. They all differ in respect to the worship which is due
from man to his Creator, but they all agree in respect to the
duties which are due from man to man. Each sect adores the
Deity in its own peculiar manner, but all the sects preach the

same moral law in the name of God. If it be of the highest
importance to man, as an individual, that his religion should
be true, the case of society is not the same. Society has no
future life to hope for or to fear; and provided the citizens
profess a religion, the peculiar tenets of that religion are of
very little importance to its interests. Moreover, almost all
the sects of the United States are comprised within the great
unity of Christianity, and Christian morality is everywhere
the same.

It may be believed without unfairness that a certain number
of Americans pursue a peculiar form of worship, from habit
more than from conviction. In the United States the sover-
eign authority is religious, and consequently hypocrisy must
be common; but there is no country in the whole world in
which the Christian religion retains a greater influence over
the souls of men than in America; and there can be no greater
proof of its utility, and of its conformity to human nature,
than that its influence is most powerfully felt over the most
enlightened and free nation of the earth.
I have remarked that the members of the American clergy

human heart? but I am certain that they hold it to be indis-
pensable to the maintenance of republican institutions. This
opinion is not peculiar to a class of citizens or to a party, but
it belongs to the whole nation, and to every rank of society.
In the United States, if a political character attacks a sect,
this may not prevent even the partisans of that very sect from
supporting him; but if he attacks all the sects together, ev-
eryone abandons him, and he remains alone.
Whilst I was in America, a witness, who happened to be
called at the assizes of the county of Chester (State of New
York), declared that he did not believe in the existence of
God, or in the immortality of the soul. The judge refused to
admit his evidence, on the ground that the witness had de-
stroyed beforehand all the confidence of the Court in what
he was about to say.* The newspapers related the fact with-
out any further comment.
* The New York “Spectator” of August 23, 1831, relates the fact
in the following terms: – “The Court of Common Pleas of Chester
county (New York) a few days since rejected a witness who de-
clared his disbelief in the existence of God. The presiding judge
remarked that he had not before been aware that there was a man
living who did not believe in the existence of God; that this belief
constituted the sanction of all testimony in a court of justice, and
that he knew of no cause in a Christian country where a witness
had been permitted to testify without such belief.”

The Americans combine the notions of Christianity and
of liberty so intimately in their minds, that it is impossible
to make them conceive the one without the other; and with
them this conviction does not spring from that barren tradi-
tionary faith which seems to vegetate in the soul rather than
to live.
I have known of societies formed by the Americans to send
out ministers of the Gospel into the new Western States to
found schools and churches there, lest religion should be
suffered to die away in those remote settlements, and the
rising States be less fitted to enjoy free institutions than the
people from which they emanated. I met with wealthy New
Englanders who abandoned the country in which they were
born in order to lay the foundations of Christianity and of
freedom on the banks of the Missouri, or in the prairies of
Illinois. Thus religious zeal is perpetually stimulated in the
United States by the duties of patriotism. These men do not
act from an exclusive consideration of the promises of a fu-
ture life; eternity is only one motive of their devotion to the
cause; and if you converse with these missionaries of Chris-
tian civilization, you will be surprised to find how much value

fight for their own advantage, whatever be the colors they
wear: it is not to these that I address myself. But there are
others who look forward to the republican form of govern-
ment as a tranquil and lasting state, towards which modern
society is daily impelled by the ideas and manners of the
time, and who sincerely desire to prepare men to be free.
When these men attack religious opinions, they obey the
dictates of their passions to the prejudice of their interests.
Despotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot.
Religion is much more necessary in the republic which they
set forth in glowing colors than in the monarchy which they
attack; and it is more needed in democratic republics than in
any others. How is it possible that society should escape de-
struction if the moral tie be not strengthened in proportion
as the political tie is relaxed? and what can be done with a
people which is its own master, if it be not submissive to the
Divinity?

Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining the Demo-
cratic Republic – Part III

Principal Causes Which Render Religion Powerful In
America Care taken by the Americans to separate the Church
from the State – The laws, public opinion, and even the ex-
ertions of the clergy concur to promote this end – Influence
of religion upon the mind in the United States attributable
to this cause – Reason of this – What is the natural state of
men with regard to religion at the present time – What are
the peculiar and incidental causes which prevent men, in
certain countries, from arriving at this state.

The philosophers of the eighteenth century explained the
gradual decay of religious faith in a very simple manner.
Religious zeal, said they, must necessarily fail, the more gen-
erally liberty is established and knowledge diffused. Unfor-
tunately, facts are by no means in accordance with their
theory. There are certain populations in Europe whose un-
belief is only equalled by their ignorance and their debase-
ment, whilst in America one of the freest and most enlight-

ened nations in the world fulfils all the outward duties of
religious fervor.
Upon my arrival in the United States, the religious aspect
of the country was the first thing that struck my attention;
and the longer I stayed there the more did I perceive the
great political consequences resulting from this state of things,
to which I was unaccustomed. In France I had almost always
seen the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom pursuing
courses diametrically opposed to each other; but in America
I found that they were intimately united, and that they
reigned in common over the same country. My desire to dis-
cover the causes of this phenomenon increased from day to
day. In order to satisfy it I questioned the members of all the
different sects; and I more especially sought the society of
the clergy, who are the depositaries of the different persua-
sions, and who are more especially interested in their dura-
tion. As a member of the Roman Catholic Church I was
more particularly brought into contact with several of its
priests, with whom I became intimately acquainted. To each
of these men I expressed my astonishment and I explained
my doubts; I found that they differed upon matters of detail

alone; and that they mainly attributed the peaceful dominion
of religion in their country to the separation of Church and
State. I do not hesitate to affirm that during my stay in America
I did not meet with a single individual, of the clergy or of the
laity, who was not of the same opinion upon this point.
This led me to examine more attentively than I had hith-
erto done, the station which the American clergy occupy in
political society. I learned with surprise that they filled no
public appointments;* not one of them is to be met with in
the administration, and they are not even represented in the
legislative assemblies. In several States** the law excludes them
from political life, public opinion in all. And when I came to

inquire into the prevailing spirit of the clergy I found that
most of its members seemed to retire of their own accord
from the exercise of power, and that they made it the pride
of their profession to abstain from politics.
I heard them inveigh against ambition and deceit, under
whatever political opinions these vices might chance to lurk;
but I learned from their discourses that men are not guilty in
the eye of God for any opinions concerning political gov-
ernment which they may profess with sincerity, any more
than they are for their mistakes in building a house or in
driving a furrow. I perceived that these ministers of the gos-
pel eschewed all parties with the anxiety attendant upon per-
sonal interest. These facts convinced me that what I had been
told was true; and it then became my object to investigate
their causes, and to inquire how it happened that the real
authority of religion was increased by a state of things which
diminished its apparent force: these causes did not long es-
cape my researches.
The short space of threescore years can never content the
imagination of man; nor can the imperfect joys of this world
satisfy his heart. Man alone, of all created beings, displays a

the ministers of the gospel are, by their profession, dedicated to the
service of God and the care of souls, and ought not to be diverted
from the great duties of their functions: therefore no minister of the
gospel, or priest of any denomination whatsoever, shall at any time
hereafter, under any pretence or description whatever, be eligible to,
or capable of holding, any civil or military office or place within this
State.”

restore the Christian Church of Europe to the energy of its
earlier days; that power belongs to God alone; but it may be
the effect of human policy to leave the faith in the full exer-
cise of the strength which it still retains.

How the Instruction, the Habits, and the Practical
Experience of the Americans Promote the Success of
Their Democratic Institutions

What is to be understood by the instruction of the Ameri-
can people – The human mind more superficially instructed
in the United States than in Europe – No one completely
uninstructed – Reason of this – Rapidity with which opin-
ions are diffused even in the uncultivated States of the West
– Practical experience more serviceable to the Americans than
book-learning.

I have but little to add to what I have already said concern-
ing the influence which the instruction and the habits of the
Americans exercise upon the maintenance of their political
institutions.

America has hitherto produced very few writers of distinc-
tion; it possesses no great historians, and not a single emi-
nent poet. The inhabitants of that country look upon what
are properly styled literary pursuits with a kind of disappro-
bation; and there are towns of very second-rate importance
in Europe in which more literary works are annually pub-
lished than in the twenty-four States of the Union put to-
gether. The spirit of the Americans is averse to general ideas;
and it does not seek theoretical discoveries. Neither politics
nor manufactures direct them to these occupations; and al-
though new laws are perpetually enacted in the United States,
no great writers have hitherto inquired into the general prin-
ciples of their legislation. The Americans have lawyers and
commentators, but no jurists;* and they furnish examples
rather than lessons to the world. The same observation ap-
plies to the mechanical arts. In America, the inventions of
Europe are adopted with sagacity; they are perfected, and
adapted with admirable skill to the wants of the country.
Manufactures exist, but the science of manufacture is not
cultivated; and they have good workmen, but very few in-

and Wheaton.

ventors. Fulton was obliged to proffer his services to foreign
nations for a long time before he was able to devote them to
his own country.
The observer who is desirous of forming an opinion on
the state of instruction amongst the Anglo-Americans must
consider the same object from two different points of view.
If he only singles out the learned, he will be astonished to
find how rare they are; but if he counts the ignorant, the
American people will appear to be the most enlightened com-
munity in the world. The whole population, as I observed in
another place, is situated between these two extremes. In
New England, every citizen receives the elementary notions
of human knowledge; he is moreover taught the doctrines
and the evidences of his religion, the history of his country,
and the leading features of its Constitution. In the States of
Connecticut and Massachusetts, it is extremely rare to find a
man imperfectly acquainted with all these things, and a per-
son wholly ignorant of them is a sort of phenomenon.
When I compare the Greek and Roman republics with
these American States; the manuscript libraries of the former,
and their rude population, with the innumerable journals
and the enlightened people of the latter; when I remember
all the attempts which are made to judge the modern repub-

lics by the assistance of those of antiquity, and to infer what
will happen in our time from what took place two thousand
years ago, I am tempted to burn my books, in order to apply
none but novel ideas to so novel a condition of society.
What I have said of New England must not, however, be
applied indistinctly to the whole Union; as we advance to-
wards the West or the South, the instruction of the people
diminishes. In the States which are adjacent to the Gulf of
Mexico, a certain number of individuals may be found, as in
our own countries, who are devoid of the rudiments of in-
struction. But there is not a single district in the United States
sunk in complete ignorance; and for a very simple reason:
the peoples of Europe started from the darkness of a barba-
rous condition, to advance toward the light of civilization;
their progress has been unequal; some of them have improved
apace, whilst others have loitered in their course, and some
have stopped, and are still sleeping upon the way.*
*In the Northern States the number of persons destitute of
instruction is inconsiderable, the largest number being
241,152 in the State of New York (according to Spaulding’s
“Handbook of American Statistics” for 1874); but in the
South no less than 1,516,339 whites and 2,671,396 colored
persons are returned as “illiterate.”

seek a country there, in order to escape that poverty which
awaited them in their native provinces. As soon as the pio-
neer arrives upon the spot which is to serve him for a retreat,
he fells a few trees and builds a loghouse. Nothing can offer
a more miserable aspect than these isolated dwellings. The
traveller who approaches one of them towards nightfall, sees
the flicker of the hearth-flame through the chinks in the walls;
and at night, if the wind rises, he hears the roof of boughs
shake to and fro in the midst of the great forest trees. Who
would not suppose that this poor hut is the asylum of rude-
ness and ignorance? Yet no sort of comparison can be drawn
between the pioneer and the dwelling which shelters him.
Everything about him is primitive and unformed, but he is
himself the result of the labor and the experience of eighteen
centuries. He wears the dress, and he speaks the language of
cities; he is acquainted with the past, curious of the future,
and ready for argument upon the present; he is, in short, a
highly civilized being, who consents, for a time, to inhabit
the backwoods, and who penetrates into the wilds of the
New World with the Bible, an axe, and a file of newspapers.
It is difficult to imagine the incredible rapidity with which

public opinion circulates in the midst of these deserts.* I do
not think that so much intellectual intercourse takes place in
the most enlightened and populous districts of France.* It can-
not be doubted that, in the United States, the instruction of
the people powerfully contributes to the support of a demo-
cratic republic; and such must always be the case, I believe,
where instruction which awakens the understanding is not
separated from moral education which amends the heart. But
I by no means exaggerate this benefit, and I am still further
from thinking, as so many people do think in Europe, that
men can be instantaneously made citizens by teaching them
to read and write. True information is mainly derived from
experience; and if the Americans had not been gradually ac-
customed to govern themselves, their book-learning would not
assist them much at the present day.
*I travelled along a portion of the frontier of the United States
in a sort of cart which was termed the mail. We passed, day
and night, with great rapidity along the roads which were
scarcely marked out, through immense forests; when the
gloom of the woods became impenetrable the coachman
lighted branches of fir, and we journeyed along by the light
they cast. From time to time we came to a hut in the midst
of the forest, which was a post- office. The mail dropped an

enormous bundle of letters at the door of this isolated dwell-
ing, and we pursued our way at full gallop, leaving the in-
habitants of the neighboring log houses to send for their
share of the treasure.
[When the author visited America the locomotive and the
railroad were scarcely invented, and not yet introduced in
the United States. It is superfluous to point out the immense
effect of those inventions in extending civilization and de-
veloping the resources of that vast continent. In 1831 there
were 51 miles of railway in the United States; in 1872 there
were 60,000 miles of railway.]
**In 1832 each inhabitant of Michigan paid a sum equiva-
lent to 1 fr. 22 cent. (French money) to the post-office rev-
enue, and each inhabitant of the Floridas paid 1 fr. 5 cent.
(See “National Calendar,” 1833, p. 244.) In the same year
each inhabitant of the Departement du Nord paid 1 fr. 4
cent. to the revenue of the French post-office. (See the
“Compte rendu de l’administration des Finances,” 1833, p.
623.) Now the State of Michigan only contained at that time
7 inhabitants per square league and Florida only 5: the pub-
lic instruction and the commercial activity of these districts
is inferior to that of most of the States in the Union, whilst
the Departement du Nord, which contains 3,400 inhabit-
ants per square league, is one of the most enlightened and
manufacturing parts of France.

work of society is ever going on beneath his eyes, and, as it
were, under his hands.
In the United States politics are the end and aim of educa-
tion; in Europe its principal object is to fit men for private
life. The interference of the citizens in public affairs is too
rare an occurrence for it to be anticipated beforehand. Upon
casting a glance over society in the two hemispheres, these
differences are indicated even by its external aspect.
In Europe we frequently introduce the ideas and the hab-
its of private life into public affairs; and as we pass at once
from the domestic circle to the government of the State, we
may frequently be heard to discuss the great interests of soci-
ety in the same manner in which we converse with our friends.
The Americans, on the other hand, transfuse the habits of
public life into their manners in private; and in their coun-
try the jury is introduced into the games of schoolboys, and
parliamentary forms are observed in the order of a feast.

Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining the
Democratic Republic – Part IV

The Laws Contribute More to the Maintenance of the
Democratic Republic in the United States Than the
Physical Circumstances of the Country, and the Manners
More Than the Laws

All the nations of America have a democratic state of society –
Yet democratic institutions only subsist amongst the Anglo-
Americans – The Spaniards of South America, equally favored
by physical causes as the Anglo-Americans, unable to main-
tain a democratic republic – Mexico, which has adopted the
Constitution of the United States, in the same predicament –
The Anglo-Americans of the West less able to maintain it than
those of the East – Reason of these different results.

I have remarked that the maintenance of democratic institu-
tions in the United States is attributable to the circumstances,
the laws, and the manners of that country.* Most Europeans

are only acquainted with the first of these three causes, and
they are apt to give it a preponderating importance which it
does not really possess.
It is true that the Anglo-Saxons settled in the New World
in a state of social equality; the low-born and the noble were
not to be found amongst them; and professional prejudices
were always as entirely unknown as the prejudices of birth.
Thus, as the condition of society was democratic, the em-
pire of democracy was established without difficulty. But this
circumstance is by no means peculiar to the United States;
almost all the trans-Atlantic colonies were founded by men
equal amongst themselves, or who became so by inhabiting
them. In no one part of the New World have Europeans
been able to create an aristocracy. Nevertheless, democratic
institutions prosper nowhere but in the United States.
The American Union has no enemies to contend with; it
stands in the wilds like an island in the ocean. But the Span-
iards of South America were no less isolated by nature; yet
their position has not relieved them from the charge of stand-
ing armies. They make war upon each other when they have
no foreign enemies to oppose; and the Anglo-American de-

*I remind the reader of the general signification which I give to
the word “manners,” namely, the moral and intellectual charac-
teristics of social man taken collectively.

mocracy is the only one which has hitherto been able to
maintain itself in peace.*

The territory of the Union presents a boundless field to
human activity, and inexhaustible materials for industry and
labor. The passion of wealth takes the place of ambition, and
the warmth of faction is mitigated by a sense of prosperity.
But in what portion of the globe shall we meet with more
fertile plains, with mightier rivers, or with more unexplored
and inexhaustible riches than in South America?
Nevertheless, South America has been unable to maintain
democratic institutions. If the welfare of nations depended
on their being placed in a remote position, with an un-
bounded space of habitable territory before them, the Span-
iards of South America would have no reason to complain of
their fate. And although they might enjoy less prosperity than
the inhabitants of the United States, their lot might still be
such as to excite the envy of some nations in Europe. There
are, however, no nations upon the face of the earth more
miserable than those of South America.
Thus, not only are physical causes inadequate to produce

results analogous to those which occur in North America,
but they are unable to raise the population of South America
above the level of European States, where they act in a con-
trary direction. Physical causes do not, therefore, affect the
destiny of nations so much as has been supposed.
I have met with men in New England who were on the
point of leaving a country, where they might have remained
in easy circumstances, to go to seek their fortune in the wilds.
Not far from that district I found a French population in
Canada, which was closely crowded on a narrow territory,
although the same wilds were at hand; and whilst the emi-
grant from the United States purchased an extensive estate
with the earnings of a short term of labor, the Canadian paid
as much for land as he would have done in France. Nature
offers the solitudes of the New World to Europeans; but they
are not always acquainted with the means of turning her
gifts to account. Other peoples of America have the same
physical conditions of prosperity as the Anglo-Americans,
but without their laws and their manners; and these peoples
are wretched. The laws and manners of the Anglo-Ameri-
cans are therefore that efficient cause of their greatness which
*A remark which, since the great Civil War of 1861-65, ceases
to be applicable.

is therefore at work, independently of those physical circum-
stances and peculiar laws which enable the democracy to
rule in the United States.
Another still more striking proof may be adduced. Almost
all the inhabitants of the territory of the Union are the de-
scendants of a common stock; they speak the same language,
they worship God in the same manner, they are affected by
the same physical causes, and they obey the same laws.
Whence, then, do their characteristic differences arise? Why,
in the Eastern States of the Union, does the republican gov-
ernment display vigor and regularity, and proceed with ma-
ture deliberation? Whence does it derive the wisdom and
the durability which mark its acts, whilst in the Western
States, on the contrary, society seems to be ruled by the powers
of chance? There, public business is conducted with an ir-
regularity and a passionate and feverish excitement, which
does not announce a long or sure duration.
I am no longer comparing the Anglo-American States to
foreign nations; but I am contrasting them with each other,
and endeavoring to discover why they are so unlike. The
arguments which are derived from the nature of the country

tageous situation and the best possible laws cannot maintain
a constitution in spite of the manners of a country; whilst
the latter may turn the most unfavorable positions and the
worst laws to some advantage. The importance of manners
is a common truth to which study and experience incessantly
direct our attention. It may be regarded as a central point in
the range of human observation, and the common termina-
tion of all inquiry. So seriously do I insist upon this head,
that if I have hitherto failed in making the reader feel the
important influence which I attribute to the practical expe-
rience, the habits, the opinions, in short, to the manners of
the Americans, upon the maintenance of their institutions, I
have failed in the principal object of my work.

Whether Laws and Manners Are Sufficient to Maintain
Democratic Institutions in Other Countries Besides
America

The Anglo-Americans, if transported into Europe, would be
obliged to modify their laws – Distinction to be made be-
tween democratic institutions and American institutions –

Democratic laws may be conceived better than, or at least
different from, those which the American democracy has
adopted – The example of America only proves that it is
possible to regulate democracy by the assistance of manners
and legislation.

I have asserted that the success of democratic institutions in
the United States is more intimately connected with the laws
themselves, and the manners of the people, than with the
nature of the country. But does it follow that the same causes
would of themselves produce the same results, if they were
put into operation elsewhere; and if the country is no ad-
equate substitute for laws and manners, can laws and man-
ners in their turn prove a substitute for the country? It will
readily be understood that the necessary elements of a reply
to this question are wanting: other peoples are to be found
in the New World besides the Anglo-Americans, and as these
people are affected by the same physical circumstances as
the latter, they may fairly be compared together. But there
are no nations out of America which have adopted the same
laws and manners, being destitute of the physical advantages

and although they were the first to make the experiment,
they have succeeded in it.
The manners and laws of the Americans are not the only
ones which may suit a democratic people; but the Ameri-
cans have shown that it would be wrong to despair of regu-
lating democracy by the aid of manners and of laws. If other
nations should borrow this general and pregnant idea from
the Americans, without however intending to imitate them
in the peculiar application which they have made of it; if
they should attempt to fit themselves for that social condi-
tion, which it seems to be the will of Providence to impose
upon the generations of this age, and so to escape from the
despotism or the anarchy which threatens them; what rea-
son is there to suppose that their efforts would not be crowned
with success? The organization and the establishment of de-
mocracy in Christendom is the great political problem of
the time. The Americans, unquestionably, have not resolved
this problem, but they furnish useful data to those who un-
dertake the task.

Importance of What Precedes with Respect to the State
of Europe

It may readily be discovered with what intention I under-
took the foregoing inquiries. The question here discussed is
interesting not only to the United States, but to the whole
world; it concerns, not a nation, but all mankind. If those
nations whose social condition is democratic could only re-
main free as long as they are inhabitants of the wilds, we
could not but despair of the future destiny of the human
race; for democracy is rapidly acquiring a more extended
sway, and the wilds are gradually peopled with men. If it
were true that laws and manners are insufficient to maintain
democratic institutions, what refuge would remain open to
the nations, except the despotism of a single individual? I
am aware that there are many worthy persons at the present
time who are not alarmed at this latter alternative, and who
are so tired of liberty as to be glad of repose, far from those
storms by which it is attended. But these individuals are ill
acquainted with the haven towards which they are bound.
They are so deluded by their recollections, as to judge the

provincial prejudices, custom, and public opinion limited
the power of kings, and restrained their authority within an
invisible circle. The constitution of nations was despotic at
that time, but their manners were free. Princes had the right,
but they had neither the means nor the desire, of doing what-
ever they pleased.
But what now remains of those barriers which formerly
arrested the aggressions of tyranny? Since religion has lost its
empire over the souls of men, the most prominent boundary
which divided good from evil is overthrown; the very ele-
ments of the moral world are indeterminate; the princes and
the peoples of the earth are guided by chance, and none can
define the natural limits of despotism and the bounds of
license. Long revolutions have forever destroyed the respect
which surrounded the rulers of the State; and since they have
been relieved from the burden of public esteem, princes may
henceforward surrender themselves without fear to the se-
ductions of arbitrary power.
When kings find that the hearts of their subjects are turned
towards them, they are clement, because they are conscious
of their strength, and they are chary of the affection of their

toms, their prejudices, their traditions, and their names, are
subjected and accustomed to the same laws, it is not more
difficult to oppress them collectively than it was formerly to
oppress them singly.
Whilst the nobles enjoyed their power, and indeed long
after that power was lost, the honor of aristocracy conferred
an extraordinary degree of force upon their personal opposi-
tion. They afford instances of men who, notwithstanding
their weakness, still entertained a high opinion of their per-
sonal value, and dared to cope single-handed with the ef-
forts of the public authority. But at the present day, when all
ranks are more and more confounded, when the individual
disappears in the throng, and is easily lost in the midst of a
common obscurity, when the honor of monarchy has almost
lost its empire without being succeeded by public virtue, and
when nothing can enable man to rise above himself, who
shall say at what point the exigencies of power and the ser-
vility of weakness will stop?
As long as family feeling was kept alive, the antagonist of
oppression was never alone; he looked about him, and found
his clients, his hereditary friends, and his kinsfolk. If this

support was wanting, he was sustained by his ancestors and
animated by his posterity. But when patrimonial estates are
divided, and when a few years suffice to confound the dis-
tinctions of a race, where can family feeling be found? What
force can there be in the customs of a country which has
changed and is still perpetually changing, its aspect; in which
every act of tyranny has a precedent, and every crime an
example; in which there is nothing so old that its antiquity
can save it from destruction, and nothing so unparalleled
that its novelty can prevent it from being done? What resis-
tance can be offered by manners of so pliant a make that
they have already often yielded? What strength can even
public opinion have retained, when no twenty persons are
connected by a common tie; when not a man, nor a family,
nor chartered corporation, nor class, nor free institution, has
the power of representing or exerting that opinion; and when
every citizen – being equally weak, equally poor, and equally
dependent – has only his personal impotence to oppose to
the organized force of the government?
The annals of France furnish nothing analogous to the
condition in which that country might then be thrown. But

it may more aptly be assimilated to the times of old, and to
those hideous eras of Roman oppression, when the manners
of the people were corrupted, their traditions obliterated,
their habits destroyed, their opinions shaken, and freedom,
expelled from the laws, could find no refuge in the land;
when nothing protected the citizens, and the citizens no
longer protected themselves; when human nature was the
sport of man, and princes wearied out the clemency of Heaven
before they exhausted the patience of their subjects. Those
who hope to revive the monarchy of Henry IV or of Louis
XIV, appear to me to be afflicted with mental blindness; and
when I consider the present condition of several European
nations – a condition to which all the others tend – I am led
to believe that they will soon be left with no other alterna-
tive than democratic liberty, or the tyranny of the Caesars.*

And indeed it is deserving of consideration, whether men
are to be entirely emancipated or entirely enslaved; whether
their rights are to be made equal, or wholly taken away from
them. If the rulers of society were reduced either gradually

*This prediction of the return of France to imperial despo-
tism, and of the true character of that despotic power, was
written in 1832, and realized to the letter in 1852.

to raise the crowd to their own level, or to sink the citizens
below that of humanity, would not the doubts of many be
resolved, the consciences of many be healed, and the commu-
nity prepared to make great sacrifices with little difficulty? In
that case, the gradual growth of democratic manners and in-
stitutions should be regarded, not as the best, but as the only
means of preserving freedom; and without liking the govern-
ment of democracy, it might be adopted as the most appli-
cable and the fairest remedy for the present ills of society.
It is difficult to associate a people in the work of govern-
ment; but it is still more difficult to supply it with experi-
ence, and to inspire it with the feelings which it requires in
order to govern well. I grant that the caprices of democracy
are perpetual; its instruments are rude; its laws imperfect.
But if it were true that soon no just medium would exist
between the empire of democracy and the dominion of a
single arm, should we not rather incline towards the former
than submit voluntarily to the latter? And if complete equal-
ity be our fate, is it not better to be levelled by free institu-
tions than by despotic power?
Those who, after having read this book, should imagine

if the peaceable empire of the majority be not founded
amongst us in time, we shall sooner or later arrive at the
unlimited authority of a single despot.

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition of Three Races
in the United States – Part I

The Present and Probable Future Condition of the Three
Races Which Inhabit the Territory of the United States

The principal part of the task which I had imposed upon
myself is now performed. I have shown, as far as I was able,
the laws and the manners of the American democracy. Here
I might stop; but the reader would perhaps feel that I had
not satisfied his expectations.
The absolute supremacy of democracy is not all that we
meet with in America; the inhabitants of the New World
may be considered from more than one point of view. In the
course of this work my subject has often led me to speak of
the Indians and the Negroes; but I have never been able to
stop in order to show what place these two races occupy in

it is necessary to contend with, and he has learnt only to
submit and obey. In short, he sinks to such a depth of wretch-
edness, that while servitude brutalizes, liberty destroys him.
Oppression has been no less fatal to the Indian than to the
negro race, but its effects are different. Before the arrival of
white men in the New World, the inhabitants of North
America lived quietly in their woods, enduring the vicissi-
tudes and practising the virtues and vices common to savage
nations. The Europeans, having dispersed the Indian tribes
and driven them into the deserts, condemned them to a
wandering life full of inexpressible sufferings.
Savage nations are only controlled by opinion and by cus-
tom. When the North American Indians had lost the senti-
ment of attachment to their country; when their families
were dispersed, their traditions obscured, and the chain of
their recollections broken; when all their habits were changed,
and their wants increased beyond measure, European tyr-
anny rendered them more disorderly and less civilized than
they were before. The moral and physical condition of these
tribes continually grew worse, and they became more barba-
rous as they became more wretched. Nevertheless, the Euro-

peans have not been able to metamorphose the character of
the Indians; and though they have had power to destroy them,
they have never been able to make them submit to the rules
of civilized society.
The lot of the negro is placed on the extreme limit of ser-
vitude, while that of the Indian lies on the uttermost verge
of liberty; and slavery does not produce more fatal effects
upon the first, than independence upon the second. The
negro has lost all property in his own person, and he cannot
dispose of his existence without committing a sort of fraud:
but the savage is his own master as soon as he is able to act;
parental authority is scarcely known to him; he has never
bent his will to that of any of his kind, nor learned the dif-
ference between voluntary obedience and a shameful sub-
jection; and the very name of law is unknown to him. To be
free, with him, signifies to escape from all the shackles of
society. As he delights in this barbarous independence, and
would rather perish than sacrifice the least part of it, civiliza-
tion has little power over him.
The negro makes a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate
himself amongst men who repulse him; he conforms to the

tastes of his oppressors, adopts their opinions, and hopes by
imitating them to form a part of their community. Having
been told from infancy that his race is naturally inferior to
that of the whites, he assents to the proposition and is ashamed
of his own nature. In each of his features he discovers a trace
of slavery, and, if it were in his power, he would willingly rid
himself of everything that makes him what he is.
The Indian, on the contrary, has his imagination inflated
with the pretended nobility of his origin, and lives and dies
in the midst of these dreams of pride. Far from desiring to
conform his habits to ours, he loves his savage life as the
distinguishing mark of his race, and he repels every advance
to civilization, less perhaps from the hatred which he enter-
tains for it, than from a dread of resembling the Europeans.
*a While he has nothing to oppose to our perfection in the
arts but the resources of the desert, to our tactics nothing
but undisciplined courage; whilst our well-digested plans are
met by the spontaneous instincts of savage life, who can
wonder if he fails in this unequal contest?
*The native of North America retains his opinions and the
most insignificant of his habits with a degree of tenacity which
has no parallel in history. For more than two hundred years
the wandering tribes of North America have had daily inter-

course with the whites, and they have never derived from
them either a custom or an idea. Yet the Europeans have
exercised a powerful influence over the savages: they have
made them more licentious, but not more European. In the
summer of 1831 I happened to be beyond Lake Michigan,
at a place called Green Bay, which serves as the extreme fron-
tier between the United States and the Indians on the north-
western side. Here I became acquainted with an American
officer, Major H., who, after talking to me at length on the
inflexibility of the Indian character, related the following fact:
– “I formerly knew a young Indian,” said he, “who had been
educated at a college in New England, where he had greatly
distinguished himself, and had acquired the external appear-
ance of a member of civilized society. When the war broke
out between ourselves and the English in 1810, I saw this
young man again; he was serving in our army, at the head of
the warriors of his tribe, for the Indians were admitted
amongst the ranks of the Americans, upon condition that
they would abstain from their horrible custom of scalping
their victims. On the evening of the battle of . . ., C. came
and sat himself down by the fire of our bivouac. I asked him
what had been his fortune that day: he related his exploits;
and growing warm and animated by the recollection of them,
he concluded by suddenly opening the breast of his coat,
saying, ‘You must not betray me – see here!’ And I actually
beheld,” said the Major, “between his body and his shirt, the
skin and hair of an English head, still dripping with gore.”

themselves upon the banks of the fountain; and the young
Indian, taking the child in her arms, lavished upon her such
fond caresses as mothers give; while the negress endeavored
by various little artifices to attract the attention of the young
Creole.
The child displayed in her slightest gestures a conscious-
ness of superiority which formed a strange contrast with her
infantine weakness; as if she received the attentions of her
companions with a sort of condescension. The negress was
seated on the ground before her mistress, watching her small-
est desires, and apparently divided between strong affection
for the child and servile fear; whilst the savage displayed, in
the midst of her tenderness, an air of freedom and of pride
which was almost ferocious. I had approached the group,
and I contemplated them in silence; but my curiosity was
probably displeasing to the Indian woman, for she suddenly
rose, pushed the child roughly from her, and giving me an
angry look plunged into the thicket. I had often chanced to
see individuals met together in the same place, who belonged
to the three races of men which people North America. I
had perceived from many different results the preponder-

ance of the whites. But in the picture which I have just been
describing there was something peculiarly touching; a bond
of affection here united the oppressors with the oppressed,
and the effort of nature to bring them together rendered still
more striking the immense distance placed between them
by prejudice and by law.

The Present and Probable Future Condition of the
Indian Tribes Which Inhabit the Territory Possessed by
the Union

Gradual disappearance of the native tribes – Manner in which
it takes place -Miseries accompanying the forced migrations
of the Indians – The savages of North America had only two
ways of escaping destruction; war or civilization -They are
no longer able to make war – Reasons why they refused to
become civilized when it was in their power, and why they
cannot become so now that they desire it – Instance of the
Creeks and Cherokees -Policy of the particular States towards
these Indians – Policy of the Federal Government.

None of the Indian tribes which formerly inhabited the ter-
ritory of New England – the Naragansetts, the Mohicans,
the Pecots – have any existence but in the recollection of
man. The Lenapes, who received William Penn, a hundred
and fifty years ago, upon the banks of the Delaware, have
disappeared; and I myself met with the last of the Iroquois,
who were begging alms. The nations I have mentioned for-
merly covered the country to the sea-coast; but a traveller at
the present day must penetrate more than a hundred leagues
into the interior of the continent to find an Indian. Not
only have these wild tribes receded, but they are destroyed;
*b and as they give way or perish, an immense and increas-
ing people fills their place. There is no instance upon record
of so prodigious a growth, or so rapid a destruction: the
manner in which the latter change takes place is not difficult
to describe.
When the Indians were the sole inhabitants of the wilds
from whence they have since been expelled, their wants were

few. Their arms were of their own manufacture, their only
drink was the water of the brook, and their clothes consisted
of the skins of animals, whose flesh furnished them with food.
The Europeans introduced amongst the savages of North
America fire-arms, ardent spirits, and iron: they taught them
to exchange for manufactured stuffs, the rough garments
which had previously satisfied their untutored simplicity.
Having acquired new tastes, without the arts by which they
could be gratified, the Indians were obliged to have recourse
to the workmanship of the whites; but in return for their
productions the savage had nothing to offer except the rich
furs which still abounded in his woods. Hence the chase be-
came necessary, not merely to provide for his subsistence,
but in order to procure the only objects of barter which he
could furnish to Europe.* Whilst the wants of the natives
were thus increasing, their resources continued to diminish.
*Messrs. Clarke and Cass, in their Report to Congress on
February 4, 1829, p. 23, expressed themselves thus: – “The
time when the Indians generally could supply themselves
with food and clothing, without any of the articles of civi-
lized life, has long since passed away. The more remote tribes,
beyond the Mississippi, who live where immense herds of
buffalo are yet to be found and who follow those animals in

*In the thirteen original States there are only 6,273 Indians
remaining. (See Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No.
117, p. 90.) [The decrease in now far greater, and is verging
on extinction. See page 360 of this volume.

From the moment when a European settlement is formed
in the neighborhood of the territory occupied by the Indi-
ans, the beasts of chase take the alarm.* Thousands of sav-
ages, wandering in the forests and destitute of any fixed dwell-
ing, did not disturb them; but as soon as the continuous
sounds of European labor are heard in their neighborhood,
they begin to flee away, and retire to the West, where their
instinct teaches them that they will find deserts of immea-
surable extent. “The buffalo is constantly receding,” say
Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their Report of the year 1829; “a
few years since they approached the base of the Alleghany;
and a few years hence they may even be rare upon the im-
mense plains which extend to the base of the Rocky Moun-
tains.” I have been assured that this effect of the approach of

*“Five years ago,” (says Volney in his “Tableau des Etats-
Unis,” p. 370) “in going from Vincennes to Kaskaskia, a
territory which now forms part of the State of Illinois, but
which at the time I mention was completely wild (1797),
you could not cross a prairie without seeing herds of from
four to five hundred buffaloes. There are now none remain-
ing; they swam across the Mississippi to escape from the
hunters, and more particularly from the bells of the Ameri-
can cows.”

the whites is often felt at two hundred leagues’ distance from
their frontier. Their influence is thus exerted over tribes whose
name is unknown to them; and who suffer the evils of usur-
pation long before they are acquainted with the authors of
their distress.*

Bold adventurers soon penetrate into the country the In-
dians have deserted, and when they have advanced about
fifteen or twenty leagues from the extreme frontiers of the
whites, they begin to build habitations for civilized beings in
the midst of the wilderness. This is done without difficulty,
as the territory of a hunting-nation is ill-defined; it is the
common property of the tribe, and belongs to no one in
particular, so that individual interests are not concerned in
the protection of any part of it.
A few European families, settled in different situations at a
considerable distance from each other, soon drive away the

wild animals which remain between their places of abode.
The Indians, who had previously lived in a sort of abun-
dance, then find it difficult to subsist, and still more difficult
to procure the articles of barter which they stand in need of.
To drive away their game is to deprive them of the means
of existence, as effectually as if the fields of our agriculturists
were stricken with barrenness; and they are reduced, like fam-
ished wolves, to prowl through the forsaken woods in quest
of prey. Their instinctive love of their country attaches them
to the soil which gave them birth,* even after it has ceased to
yield anything but misery and death. At length they are com-
pelled to acquiesce, and to depart: they follow the traces of
the elk, the buffalo, and the beaver, and are guided by these
wild animals in the choice of their future country. Properly

* The truth of what I here advance may be easily proved by
consulting the tabular statement of Indian tribes inhabiting
the United States and their territories. (Legislative Docu-
ments, 20th Congress, No. 117, pp. 90-105.) It is there
shown that the tribes in the centre of America are rapidly
decreasing, although the Europeans are still at a consider-
able distance from them.

*“The Indians,” say Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their Report
to Congress, p. 15, “are attached to their country by the same
feelings which bind us to ours; and, besides, there are certain
superstitious notions connected with the alienation of what
the Great Spirit gave to their ancestors, which operate strongly
upon the tribes who have made few or no cessions, but which
are gradually weakened as our intercourse with them is ex-
tended. ‘We will not sell the spot which contains the bones
of our fathers,’ is almost always the first answer to a proposi-
tion for a sale.”

ollection of the antiquaries of America and a few of the learned
of Europe.
I should be sorry to have my reader suppose that I am
coloring the picture too highly; I saw with my own eyes sev-
eral of the cases of misery which I have been describing; and
I was the witness of sufferings which I have not the power to
portray.
At the end of the year 1831, whilst I was on the left bank
of the Mississippi at a place named by Europeans, Memphis,
there arrived a numerous band of Choctaws (or Chactas, as
they are called by the French in Louisiana). These savages
had left their country, and were endeavoring to gain the right
bank of the Mississippi, where they hoped to find an asylum
which had been promised them by the American govern-
ment. It was then the middle of winter, and the cold was
unusually severe; the snow had frozen hard upon the ground,
and the river was drifting huge masses of ice. The Indians
had their families with them; and they brought in their train
the wounded and sick, with children newly born, and old
men upon the verge of death. They possessed neither tents
nor wagons, but only their arms and some provisions. I saw

And can you live nowhere but under your own sun? Beyond
those mountains which you see at the horizon, beyond the
lake which bounds your territory on the west, there lie vast
countries where beasts of chase are found in great abundance;
sell your lands to us, and go to live happily in those soli-
tudes.” After holding this language, they spread before the
eyes of the Indians firearms, woollen garments, kegs of
brandy, glass necklaces, bracelets of tinsel, earrings, and look-
ing-glasses.* If, when they have beheld all these riches, they
still hesitate, it is insinuated that they have not the means of
refusing their required consent, and that the government it-
self will not long have the power of protecting them in their
rights. What are they to do? Half convinced, and half com-
pelled, they go to inhabit new deserts, where the importu-
nate whites will not let them remain ten years in tranquillity.
In this manner do the Americans obtain, at a very low price,
whole provinces, which the richest sovereigns of Europe could
not purchase.**
*See, in the Legislative Documents of Congress (Doc. 117),
the narrative of what takes place on these occasions. This
curious passage is from the above-mentioned report, made
to Congress by Messrs. Clarke and Cass in February, 1829.

Mr. Cass is now the Secretary of War.
“The Indians,” says the report, “reach the treaty-ground
poor and almost naked. Large quantities of goods are taken
there by the traders, and are seen and examined by the Indi-
ans. The women and children become importunate to have
their wants supplied, and their influence is soon exerted to
induce a sale. Their improvidence is habitual and uncon-
querable. The gratification of his immediate wants and de-
sires is the ruling passion of an Indian. The expectation of
future advantages seldom produces much effect. The experi-
ence of the past is lost, and the prospects of the future disre-
garded. It would be utterly hopeless to demand a cession of
land, unless the means were at hand of gratifying their im-
mediate wants; and when their condition and circumstances
are fairly considered, it ought not to surprise us that they are
so anxious to relieve themselves.”
**On May 19, 1830, Mr. Edward Everett affirmed before
the House of Representatives, that the Americans had al-
ready acquired by treaty, to the east and west of the Missis-
sippi, 230,000,000 of acres. In 1808 the Osages gave up
48,000,000 acres for an annual payment of $1,000. In 1818
the Quapaws yielded up 29,000,000 acres for $4,000. They
reserved for themselves a territory of 1,000,000 acres for a
hunting-ground. A solemn oath was taken that it should be
respected: but before long it was invaded like the rest. Mr.
Bell, in his Report of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Feb-
ruary 24, 1830, has these words: – “To pay an Indian tribe

what their ancient hunting-grounds are worth to them, after
the game is fled or destroyed, as a mode of appropriating
wild lands claimed by Indians, has been found more conve-
nient, and certainly it is more agreeable to the forms of jus-
tice, as well as more merciful, than to assert the possession of
them by the sword. Thus the practice of buying Indian titles
is but the substitute which humanity and expediency have
imposed, in place of the sword, in arriving at the actual en-
joyment of property claimed by the right of discovery, and
sanctioned by the natural superiority allowed to the claims
of civilized communities over those of savage tribes. Up to
the present time so invariable has been the operation of cer-
tain causes, first in diminishing the value of forest lands to
the Indians, and secondly in disposing them to sell readily,
that the plan of buying their right of occupancy has never
threatened to retard, in any perceptible degree, the prosper-
ity of any of the States.” (Legislative Documents, 21st Con-
gress, No. 227, p. 6.)

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition of Three Races
– Part II

These are great evils; and it must be added that they appear
to me to be irremediable. I believe that the Indian nations of
North America are doomed to perish; and that whenever the
Europeans shall be established on the shores of the Pacific
Ocean, that race of men will be no more. *i The Indians had
only the two alternatives of war or civilization; in other words,
they must either have destroyed the Europeans or become
their equals.
At the first settlement of the colonies they might have found
it possible, by uniting their forces, to deliver themselves from

the small bodies of strangers who landed on their continent.*
They several times attempted to do it, and were on the point
of succeeding; but the disproportion of their resources, at
the present day, when compared with those of the whites, is
too great to allow such an enterprise to be thought of. Nev-
ertheless, there do arise from time to time among the Indi-
ans men of penetration, who foresee the final destiny which
awaits the native population, and who exert themselves to
unite all the tribes in common hostility to the Europeans;
but their efforts are unavailing. Those tribes which are in the
neighborhood of the whites, are too much weakened to of-
fer an effectual resistance; whilst the others, giving way to
that childish carelessness of the morrow which characterizes
savage life, wait for the near approach of danger before they
prepare to meet it; some are unable, the others are unwilling,
to exert themselves.
It is easy to foresee that the Indians will never conform to
civilization; or that it will be too late, whenever they may be

*This seems, indeed, to be the opinion of almost all Ameri-
can statesmen. “Judging of the future by the past,” says Mr.
Cass, “we cannot err in anticipating a progressive diminu-
tion of their numbers, and their eventual extinction, unless
our border should become stationary, and they be removed
beyond it, or unless some radical change should take place
in the principles of our intercourse with them, which it is
easier to hope for than to expect.”

*Amongst other warlike enterprises, there was one of the
Wampanaogs, and other confederate tribes, under Metacom
in 1675, against the colonists of New England; the English
were also engaged in war in Virginia in 1622.

inclined to make the experiment.
Civilization is the result of a long social process which takes
place in the same spot, and is handed down from one gen-
eration to another, each one profiting by the experience of
the last. Of all nations, those submit to civilization with the
most difficulty which habitually live by the chase. Pastoral
tribes, indeed, often change their place of abode; but they
follow a regular order in their migrations, and often return
again to their old stations, whilst the dwelling of the hunter
varies with that of the animals he pursues.
Several attempts have been made to diffuse knowledge
amongst the Indians, without controlling their wandering
propensities; by the Jesuits in Canada, and by the Puritans
in New England;* but none of these endeavors were crowned
by any lasting success. Civilization began in the cabin, but it
soon retired to expire in the woods. The great error of these
legislators of the Indians was their not understanding that,
in order to succeed in civilizing a people, it is first necessary
to fix it; which cannot be done without inducing it to culti-
vate the soil; the Indians ought in the first place to have been

accustomed to agriculture. But not only are they destitute of
this indispensable preliminary to civilization, they would even
have great difficulty in acquiring it. Men who have once aban-
doned themselves to the restless and adventurous life of the
hunter, feel an insurmountable disgust for the constant and
regular labor which tillage requires. We see this proved in
the bosom of our own society; but it is far more visible among
peoples whose partiality for the chase is a part of their na-
tional character.
Independently of this general difficulty, there is another,
which applies peculiarly to the Indians; they consider labor
not merely as an evil, but as a disgrace; so that their pride
prevents them from becoming civilized, as much as their in-
dolence.*
*“In all the tribes,” says Volney, in his “Tableau des Etats-
Unis,” p. 423, “there still exists a generation of old warriors,
who cannot forbear, when they see their countrymen using
the hoe, from exclaiming against the degradation of ancient
manners, and asserting that the savages owe their decline to
these innovations; adding, that they have only to return to
their primitive habits in order to recover their power and
their glory.”
*See the “Histoire de la Nouvelle France,” by Charlevoix,
and the work entitled “Lettres edifiantes.”

There is no Indian so wretched as not to retain under his
hut of bark a lofty idea of his personal worth; he considers
the cares of industry and labor as degrading occupations; he
compares the husbandman to the ox which traces the fur-
row; and even in our most ingenious handicraft, he can see
nothing but the labor of slaves. Not that he is devoid of ad-
miration for the power and intellectual greatness of the whites;
but although the result of our efforts surprises him, he con-
temns the means by which we obtain it; and while he ac-
knowledges our ascendancy, he still believes in his superior-
ity. War and hunting are the only pursuits which appear to
him worthy to be the occupations of a man.* The Indian, in

*The following description occurs in an official document: “Until a
young man has been engaged with an enemy, and has performed
some acts of valor, he gains no consideration, but is regarded nearly as
a woman. In their great war-dances all the warriors in succession strike
the post, as it is called, and recount their exploits. On these occasions
their auditory consists of the kinsmen, friends, and comrades of the
narrator. The profound impression which his discourse produces on
them is manifested by the silent attention it receives, and by the loud
shouts which hail its termination. The young man who finds himself
at such a meeting without anything to recount is very unhappy; and
instances have sometimes occurred of young warriors, whose pas-
sions had been thus inflamed, quitting the war-dance suddenly, and
going off alone to seek for trophies which they might exhibit, and
adventures which they might be allowed to relate.”

ceive barbarian habits; and the opinions of savages in what
we style feudal principles.
However strongly the vices and prejudices of the North
American Indians may be opposed to their becoming agri-
cultural and civilized, necessity sometimes obliges them to
it. Several of the Southern nations, and amongst others the
Cherokees and the Creeks,* were surrounded by Europeans,
who had landed on the shores of the Atlantic; and who, ei-

ther descending the Ohio or proceeding up the Mississippi,
arrived simultaneously upon their borders. These tribes have
not been driven from place to place, like their Northern breth-
ren; but they have been gradually enclosed within narrow
limits, like the game within the thicket, before the hunts-
men plunge into the interior. The Indians who were thus
placed between civilization and death, found themselves
obliged to live by ignominious labor like the whites. They
took to agriculture, and without entirely forsaking their old
habits or manners, sacrificed only as much as was necessary
to their existence.
The Cherokees went further; they created a written lan-
guage; established a permanent form of government; and as
everything proceeds rapidly in the New World, before they
had all of them clothes, they set up a newspaper.*

The growth of European habits has been remarkably ac-
celerated among these Indians by the mixed race which has
sprung up.** Deriving intelligence from their father’s side,

*These nations are now swallowed up in the States of Geor-
gia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. There were for-
merly in the South four great nations (remnants of which
still exist), the Choctaws, the Chickasaws, the Creeks, and
the Cherokees. The remnants of these four nations amounted,
in 1830, to about 75,000 individuals. It is computed that
there are now remaining in the territory occupied or claimed
by the Anglo-American Union about 300,000 Indians. (See
Proceedings of the Indian Board in the City of New York.)
The official documents supplied to Congress make the num-
ber amount to 313,130. The reader who is curious to know
the names and numerical strength of all the tribes which
inhabit the Anglo-American territory should consult the
documents I refer to. (Legislative Documents, 20th Con-
gress, No. 117, pp. 90-105.) [In the Census of 1870 it is
stated that the Indian population of the United States is only
25,731, of whom 7,241 are in California.

*I brought back with me to France one or two copies of this
singular publication.
**See in the Report of the Committee on Indian Affairs,
21st Congress, No. 227, p. 23, the reasons for the multipli-
cation of Indians of mixed blood among the Cherokees. The
principal cause dates from the War of Independence. Many
Anglo-Americans of Georgia, having taken the side of En-
gland, were obliged to retreat among the Indians, where they
married.

without entirely losing the savage customs of the mother,
the half-blood forms the natural link between civilization
and barbarism. Wherever this race has multiplied the savage
state has become modified, and a great change has taken
place in the manners of the people.*
*Unhappily the mixed race has been less numerous and less
influential in North America than in any other country. The
American continent was peopled by two great nations of
Europe, the French and the English. The former were not
slow in connecting themselves with the daughters of the na-
tives, but there was an unfortunate affinity between the In-
dian character and their own: instead of giving the tastes and
habits of civilized life to the savages, the French too often
grew passionately fond of the state of wild freedom they found
them in. They became the most dangerous of the inhabit-
ants of the desert, and won the friendship of the Indian by
exaggerating his vices and his virtues. M. de Senonville, the
governor of Canada, wrote thus to Louis XIV in 1685: “It
has long been believed that in order to civilize the savages we
ought to draw them nearer to us. But there is every reason to
suppose we have been mistaken. Those which have been
brought into contact with us have not become French, and
the French who have lived among them are changed into
savages, affecting to dress and live like them.” (“History of
New France,” by Charlevoix, vol. ii., p. 345.) The English-
man, on the contrary, continuing obstinately attached to the

The success of the Cherokees proves that the Indians are
capable of civilization, but it does not prove that they will
succeed in it. This difficulty which the Indians find in sub-
mitting to civilization proceeds from the influence of a gen-
eral cause, which it is almost impossible for them to escape.
An attentive survey of history demonstrates that, in general,
barbarous nations have raised themselves to civilization by
degrees, and by their own efforts. Whenever they derive
knowledge from a foreign people, they stood towards it in
the relation of conquerors, and not of a conquered nation.
When the conquered nation is enlightened, and the con-
querors are half savage, as in the case of the invasion of Rome
by the Northern nations or that of China by the Mongols,
the power which victory bestows upon the barbarian is suffi-
cient to keep up his importance among civilized men, and
permit him to rank as their equal, until he becomes their

customs and the most insignificant habits of his forefathers,
has remained in the midst of the American solitudes just
what he was in the bosom of European cities; he would not
allow of any communication with savages whom he despised,
and avoided with care the union of his race with theirs. Thus
while the French exercised no salutary influence over the
Indians, the English have always remained alien from them.

(it must be owned) the most avaricious nation on the globe,
whilst they are still semi-barbarian: to find despots in their
instructors, and to receive knowledge from the hand of op-
pression. Living in the freedom of the woods, the North
American Indian was destitute, but he had no feeling of in-
feriority towards anyone; as soon, however, as he desires to
penetrate into the social scale of the whites, he takes the low-
est rank in society, for he enters, ignorant and poor, within
the pale of science and wealth. After having led a life of agi-
tation, beset with evils and dangers, but at the same time
filled with proud emotions,* he is obliged to submit to a
wearisome, obscure, and degraded state; and to gain the bread
which nourishes him by hard and ignoble labor; such are in
his eyes the only results of which civilization can boast: and
even this much he is not sure to obtain.
*There is in the adventurous life of the hunter a certain irre-
sistible charm, which seizes the heart of man and carries him
away in spite of reason and experience. This is plainly shown
by the memoirs of Tanner. Tanner is a European who was
carried away at the age of six by the Indians, and has re-
mained thirty years with them in the woods. Nothing can be
conceived more appalling that the miseries which he de-

scribes. He tells us of tribes without a chief, families without
a nation to call their own, men in a state of isolation, wrecks
of powerful tribes wandering at random amid the ice and
snow and desolate solitudes of Canada. Hunger and cold
pursue them; every day their life is in jeopardy. Amongst
these men, manners have lost their empire, traditions are
without power. They become more and more savage. Tanner
shared in all these miseries; he was aware of his European
origin; he was not kept away from the whites by force; on
the contrary, he came every year to trade with them, entered
their dwellings, and witnessed their enjoyments; he knew
that whenever he chose to return to civilized life he was per-
fectly able to do so – and he remained thirty years in the
deserts. When he came into civilized society he declared that
the rude existence which he described, had a secret charm
for him which he was unable to define: he returned to it
again and again: at length he abandoned it with poignant
regret; and when he was at length fixed among the whites,
several of his children refused to share his tranquil and easy
situation. I saw Tanner myself at the lower end of Lake Su-
perior; he seemed to me to be more like a savage than a civi-
lized being. His book is written without either taste or order;
but he gives, even unconsciously, a lively picture of the preju-
dices, the passions, the vices, and, above all, of the destitu-
tion in which he lived.

than he is subjected to the still greater miseries of civilized
communities; and he finds is scarcely less difficult to live in
the midst of our abundance, than in the depth of his own
wilderness.
He has not yet lost the habits of his erratic life; the tradi-
tions of his fathers and his passion for the chase are still alive
within him. The wild enjoyments which formerly animated
him in the woods, painfully excite his troubled imagination;
and his former privations appear to be less keen, his former
perils less appalling. He contrasts the independence which
he possessed amongst his equals with the servile position
which he occupies in civilized society. On the other hand,
the solitudes which were so long his free home are still at
hand; a few hours’ march will bring him back to them once
more. The whites offer him a sum, which seems to him to be
considerable, for the ground which he has begun to clear.
This money of the Europeans may possibly furnish him with
the means of a happy and peaceful subsistence in remoter
regions; and he quits the plough, resumes his native arms,
and returns to the wilderness forever.* The condition of the
Creeks and Cherokees, to which I have already alluded, suf-

country, that they spread on all sides, and confine the French
within limits which scarcely suffice to contain them. In like
manner, in Louisiana, almost all activity in commerce and
manufacture centres in the hands of the Anglo-Americans.
But the case of Texas is still more striking: the State of
Texas is a part of Mexico, and lies upon the frontier between
that country and the United States. In the course of the last
few years the Anglo-Americans have penetrated into this prov-
ince, which is still thinly peopled; they purchase land, they
produce the commodities of the country, and supplant the
original population. It may easily be foreseen that if Mexico
takes no steps to check this change, the province of Texas
will very shortly cease to belong to that government.
If the different degrees – comparatively so slight – which
exist in European civilization produce results of such magni-
tude, the consequences which must ensue from the collision
of the most perfect European civilization with Indian sav-
ages may readily be conceived.

instances of excesses of every kind committed by the whites
upon the territory of the Indians, either in taking possession
of a part of their lands, until compelled to retire by the troops
of Congress, or carrying off their cattle, burning their houses,
cutting down their corn, and doing violence to their per-
sons. It appears, nevertheless, from all these documents that
the claims of the natives are constantly protected by the gov-
ernment from the abuse of force. The Union has a represen-
tative agent continually employed to reside among the Indi-
ans; and the report of the Cherokee agent, which is among
the documents I have referred to, is almost always favorable
to the Indians. “The intrusion of whites,” he says, “upon the
lands of the Cherokees would cause ruin to the poor, help-
less, and inoffensive inhabitants.” And he further remarks
upon the attempt of the State of Georgia to establish a divi-
sion line for the purpose of limiting the boundaries of the
Cherokees, that the line drawn having been made by the
whites, and entirely upon ex parte evidence of their several
rights, was of no validity whatever.

Washington said in one of his messages to Congress, “We
are more enlightened and more powerful than the Indian
nations, we are therefore bound in honor to treat them with
kindness and even with generosity.” But this virtuous and
high-minded policy has not been followed. The rapacity of
the settlers is usually backed by the tyranny of the govern-
ment. Although the Cherokees and the Creeks are estab-
lished upon the territory which they inhabited before the
settlement of the Europeans, and although the Americans
have frequently treated with them as with foreign nations,
the surrounding States have not consented to acknowledge
them as independent peoples, and attempts have been made
to subject these children of the woods to Anglo-American
magistrates, laws, and customs.* Destitution had driven these
unfortunate Indians to civilization, and oppression now drives
them back to their former condition: many of them aban-
don the soil which they had begun to clear, and return to
their savage course of life.
*In 1829 the State of Alabama divided the Creek territory
into counties, and subjected the Indian population to the
power of European magistrates.

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition of Three Races
– Part III

In 1830 the State of Mississippi assimilated the Choctaws
and Chickasaws to the white population, and declared that
any of them that should take the title of chief would be pun-
ished by a fine of $1,000 and a year’s imprisonment. When
these laws were enforced upon the Choctaws, who inhab-
ited that district, the tribe assembled, their chief communi-
cated to them the intentions of the whites, and read to them
some of the laws to which it was intended that they should
submit; and they unanimously declared that it was better at
once to retreat again into the wilds.
If we consider the tyrannical measures which have been
adopted by the legislatures of the Southern States, the con-
duct of their Governors, and the decrees of their courts of
justice, we shall be convinced that the entire expulsion of
the Indians is the final result to which the efforts of their
policy are directed. The Americans of that part of the Union
look with jealousy upon the aborigines,* they are aware that

these tribes have not yet lost the traditions of savage life, and
before civilization has permanently fixed them to the soil, it
is intended to force them to recede by reducing them to de-
spair. The Creeks and Cherokees, oppressed by the several
States, have appealed to the central government, which is by
no means insensible to their misfortunes, and is sincerely
desirous of saving the remnant of the natives, and of main-
taining them in the free possession of that territory, which
the Union is pledged to respect.* But the several States op-
pose so formidable a resistance to the execution of this de-
sign, that the government is obliged to consent to the extir-
pation of a few barbarous tribes in order not to endanger the
safety of the American Union.
But the federal government, which is not able to protect
the Indians, would fain mitigate the hardships of their lot;
and, with this intention, proposals have been made to trans-

*The Georgians, who are so much annoyed by the proxim-
ity of the Indians, inhabit a territory which does not at present
contain more than seven inhabitants to the square mile. In
France there are one hundred and sixty-two inhabitants to
the same extent of country.

*In 1818 Congress appointed commissioners to visit the
Arkansas Territory, accompanied by a deputation of Creeks,
Choctaws, and Chickasaws. This expedition was commanded
by Messrs. Kennerly, M’Coy, Wash Hood, and John Bell.
See the different reports of the commissioners, and their jour-
nal, in the Documents of Congress, No. 87, House of Rep-
resentatives.

port them into more remote regions at the public cost.
Between the thirty-third and thirty-seventh degrees of north
latitude, a vast tract of country lies, which has taken the name
of Arkansas, from the principal river that waters its extent. It is
bounded on the one side by the confines of Mexico, on the
other by the Mississippi. Numberless streams cross it in every
direction; the climate is mild, and the soil productive, but it is
only inhabited by a few wandering hordes of savages. The
government of the Union wishes to transport the broken rem-
nants of the indigenous population of the South to the por-
tion of this country which is nearest to Mexico, and at a great
distance from the American settlements.
We were assured, towards the end of the year 1831, that
10,000 Indians had already gone down to the shores of the
Arkansas; and fresh detachments were constantly following
them; but Congress has been unable to excite a unanimous
determination in those whom it is disposed to protect. Some,
indeed, are willing to quit the seat of oppression, but the
most enlightened members of the community refuse to aban-
don their recent dwellings and their springing crops; they
are of opinion that the work of civilization, once interrupted,
will never be resumed; they fear that those domestic habits
which have been so recently contracted, may be irrevocably
lost in the midst of a country which is still barbarous, and

where nothing is prepared for the subsistence of an agricul-
tural people; they know that their entrance into those wilds
will be opposed by inimical hordes, and that they have lost
the energy of barbarians, without acquiring the resources of
civilization to resist their attacks. Moreover, the Indians
readily discover that the settlement which is proposed to them
is merely a temporary expedient. Who can assure them that
they will at length be allowed to dwell in peace in their new
retreat? The United States pledge themselves to the obser-
vance of the obligation; but the territory which they at present
occupy was formerly secured to them by the most solemn
oaths of Anglo-American faith.* The American government

*The fifth article of the treaty made with the Creeks in Au-
gust, 1790, is in the following words: – “The United States
solemnly guarantee to the Creek nation all their land within
the limits of the United States.”
The seventh article of the treaty concluded in 1791 with
the Cherokees says: – “The United States solemnly guaran-
tee to the Cherokee nation all their lands not hereby ceded.”
The following article declared that if any citizen of the United
States or other settler not of the Indian race should establish
himself upon the territory of the Cherokees, the United States
would withdraw their protection from that individual, and
give him up to be punished as the Cherokee nation should
think fit.

does not indeed rob them of their lands, but it allows per-
petual incursions to be made on them. In a few years the
same white population which now flocks around them, will
track them to the solitudes of the Arkansas; they will then be
exposed to the same evils without the same remedies, and as
the limits of the earth will at last fail them, their only refuge
is the grave.
The Union treats the Indians with less cupidity and rigor
than the policy of the several States, but the two govern-
ments are alike destitute of good faith. The States extend
what they are pleased to term the benefits of their laws to the
Indians, with a belief that the tribes will recede rather than
submit; and the central government, which promises a per-
manent refuge to these unhappy beings is well aware of its
inability to secure it to them.*
*This does not prevent them from promising in the most
solemn manner to do so. See the letter of the President ad-
dressed to the Creek Indians, March 23, 1829 (Proceedings
of the Indian Board, in the city of New York, p. 5): “Beyond
the great river Mississippi, where a part of your nation has
gone, your father has provided a country large enough for all
of you, and he advises you to remove to it. There your white
brothers will not trouble you; they will have no claim to the

land, and you can live upon it, you and all your children, as
long as the grass grows, or the water runs, in peace and plenty.
It will be yours forever.”
The Secretary of War, in a letter written to the Cherokees,
April 18, 1829, (see the same work, p. 6), declares to them that
they cannot expect to retain possession of the lands at that time
occupied by them, but gives them the most positive assurance
of uninterrupted peace if they would remove beyond the Mis-
sissippi: as if the power which could not grant them protection
then, would be able to afford it them hereafter!

Thus the tyranny of the States obliges the savages to retire,
the Union, by its promises and resources, facilitates their re-
treat; and these measures tend to precisely the same end.*
“By the will of our Father in Heaven, the Governor of the
whole world,” said the Cherokees in their petition to Con-

*To obtain a correct idea of the policy pursued by the several
States and the Union with respect to the Indians, it is neces-
sary to consult, 1st, “The Laws of the Colonial and State
Governments relating to the Indian Inhabitants.” (See the
Legislative Documents, 21st Congress, No. 319.) 2d, The
Laws of the Union on the same subject, and especially that
of March 30, 1802. (See Story’s “Laws of the United States.”)

Indian Affairs, November 29, 1823.

not thought of, nor would our forefathers have agreed to
any treaty whose tendency was to deprive them of their rights
and their country.”
Such is the language of the Indians: their assertions are
true, their forebodings inevitable. From whichever side we
consider the destinies of the aborigines of North America,
their calamities appear to be irremediable: if they continue
barbarous, they are forced to retire; if they attempt to civilize
their manners, the contact of a more civilized community
subjects them to oppression and destitution. They perish if
they continue to wander from waste to waste, and if they
attempt to settle they still must perish; the assistance of Eu-
ropeans is necessary to instruct them, but the approach of
Europeans corrupts and repels them into savage life; they
refuse to change their habits as long as their solitudes are
their own, and it is too late to change them when they are
constrained to submit.
The Spaniards pursued the Indians with bloodhounds, like
wild beasts; they sacked the New World with no more tem-
per or compassion than a city taken by storm; but destruc-
tion must cease, and frenzy be stayed; the remnant of the

Indian population which had escaped the massacre mixed
with its conquerors, and adopted in the end their religion
and their manners.* The conduct of the Americans of the
United States towards the aborigines is characterized, on the
other hand, by a singular attachment to the formalities of
law. Provided that the Indians retain their barbarous condi-
tion, the Americans take no part in their affairs; they treat
them as independent nations, and do not possess themselves
of their hunting grounds without a treaty of purchase; and if
an Indian nation happens to be so encroached upon as to be
unable to subsist upon its territory, they afford it brotherly
assistance in transporting it to a grave sufficiently remote
from the land of its fathers.
The Spaniards were unable to exterminate the Indian race
by those unparalleled atrocities which brand them with in-
delible shame, nor did they even succeed in wholly depriv-
ing it of its rights; but the Americans of the United States

*The honor of this result is, however, by no means due to
the Spaniards. If the Indian tribes had not been tillers of the
ground at the time of the arrival of the Europeans, they would
unquestionably have been destroyed in South as well as in
North America.

have accomplished this twofold purpose with singular felic-
ity; tranquilly, legally, philanthropically, without shedding
blood, and without violating a single great principle of mo-
rality in the eyes of the world.* It is impossible to destroy
men with more respect for the laws of humanity.
*See, amongst other documents, the report made by Mr. Bell in the
name of the Committee on Indian Affairs, February 24, 1830, in
which is most logically established and most learnedly proved, that
“the fundamental principle that the Indians had no right by virtue
of their ancient possession either of will or sovereignty, has never
been abandoned either expressly or by implication.” In perusing
this report, which is evidently drawn up by an experienced hand,
one is astonished at the facility with which the author gets rid of all
arguments founded upon reason and natural right, which he desig-
nates as abstract and theoretical principles. The more I contemplate
the difference between civilized and uncivilized man with regard to
the principles of justice, the more I observe that the former contests
the justice of those rights which the latter simply violates.
[I leave this chapter wholly unchanged, for it has always appeared
to me to be one of the most eloquent and touching parts of this
book. But it has ceased to be prophetic; the destruction of the In-
dian race in the United States is already consummated. In 1870
there remained but 25,731 Indians in the whole territory of the
Union, and of these by far the largest part exist in California, Michi-
gan, Wisconsin, Dakota, and New Mexico and Nevada. In New
England, Pennsylvania, and New York the race is extinct; and the
predictions of M. de Tocqueville are fulfilled. – Translator’s Note.]

Situation of the Black Population in the United States,
and Dangers with Which Its Presence Threatens the
Whites

Why it is more difficult to abolish slavery, and to efface all
vestiges of it amongst the moderns than it was amongst the
ancients – In the United States the prejudices of the Whites
against the Blacks seem to increase in proportion as slavery
is abolished – Situation of the Negroes in the Northern and
Southern States – Why the Americans abolish slavery – Ser-

The Indians will perish in the same isolated condition in
which they have lived; but the destiny of the negroes is in

system, and restricted to one of the races of mankind; but
the wound thus inflicted upon humanity, though less exten-
sive, was at the same time rendered far more difficult of cure.
It is important to make an accurate distinction between
slavery itself and its consequences. The immediate evils which
are produced by slavery were very nearly the same in antiq-
uity as they are amongst the moderns; but the consequences
of these evils were different. The slave, amongst the ancients,
belonged to the same race as his master, and he was often the
superior of the two in education* and instruction. Freedom
was the only distinction between them; and when freedom
was conferred they were easily confounded together. The
ancients, then, had a very simple means of avoiding slavery
and its evil consequences, which was that of affranchisement;
and they succeeded as soon as they adopted this measure
generally. Not but, in ancient States, the vestiges of servi-
tude subsisted for some time after servitude itself was abol-

*It is well known that several of the most distinguished au-
thors of antiquity, and amongst them Aesop and Terence,
were, or had been slaves. Slaves were not always taken from
barbarous nations, and the chances of war reduced highly
civilized men to servitude.

ther slaves or freedmen. Thus the negro transmits the eter-
nal mark of his ignominy to all his descendants; and although
the law may abolish slavery, God alone can obliterate the
traces of its existence.
The modern slave differs from his master not only in his
condition, but in his origin. You may set the negro free, but
you cannot make him otherwise than an alien to the Euro-
pean. Nor is this all; we scarcely acknowledge the common
features of mankind in this child of debasement whom sla-
very has brought amongst us. His physiognomy is to our
eyes hideous, his understanding weak, his tastes low; and we
are almost inclined to look upon him as a being intermedi-
ate between man and the brutes.* The moderns, then, after
they have abolished slavery, have three prejudices to con-
tend against, which are less easy to attack and far less easy to
conquer than the mere fact of servitude: the prejudice of the
master, the prejudice of the race, and the prejudice of color.
It is difficult for us, who have had the good fortune to be

*To induce the whites to abandon the opinion they have
conceived of the moral and intellectual inferiority of their
former slaves, the negroes must change; but as long as this
opinion subsists, to change is impossible.

It is true, that in the North of the Union, marriages may
be legally contracted between negroes and whites; but pub-
lic opinion would stigmatize a man who should connect him-
self with a negress as infamous, and it would be difficult to
meet with a single instance of such a union. The electoral
franchise has been conferred upon the negroes in almost all
the States in which slavery has been abolished; but if they
come forward to vote, their lives are in danger. If oppressed,
they may bring an action at law, but they will find none but
whites amongst their judges; and although they may legally
serve as jurors, prejudice repulses them from that office. The
same schools do not receive the child of the black and of the
European. In the theatres, gold cannot procure a seat for the
servile race beside their former masters; in the hospitals they
lie apart; and although they are allowed to invoke the same
Divinity as the whites, it must be at a different altar, and in
their own churches, with their own clergy. The gates of
Heaven are not closed against these unhappy beings; but their
inferiority is continued to the very confines of the other world;
when the negro is defunct, his bones are cast aside, and the
distinction of condition prevails even in the equality of death.

his licentious pleasures, if the laws of his country did not
declare that she may aspire to be the legitimate partner of his
bed; but he recoils with horror from her who might become
his wife.
Thus it is, in the United States, that the prejudice which
repels the negroes seems to increase in proportion as they are
emancipated, and inequality is sanctioned by the manners
whilst it is effaced from the laws of the country. But if the
relative position of the two races which inhabit the United
States is such as I have described, it may be asked why the
Americans have abolished slavery in the North of the Union,
why they maintain it in the South, and why they aggravate
its hardships there? The answer is easily given. It is not for
the good of the negroes, but for that of the whites, that mea-
sures are taken to abolish slavery in the United States.
The first negroes were imported into Virginia about the
year 1621.* In America, therefore, as well as in the rest of
the globe, slavery originated in the South. Thence it spread

from one settlement to another; but the number of slaves
diminished towards the Northern States, and the negro popu-
lation was always very limited in New England.*

A century had scarcely elapsed since the foundation of the
colonies, when the attention of the planters was struck by
the extraordinary fact, that the provinces which were com-
paratively destitute of slaves, increased in population, in
wealth, and in prosperity more rapidly than those which
contained the greatest number of negroes. In the former,
however, the inhabitants were obliged to cultivate the soil

*See Beverley’s “History of Virginia.” See also in Jefferson’s
“Memoirs” some curious details concerning the introduc-
tion of negroes into Virginia, and the first Act which pro-
hibited the importation of them in 1778.

*The number of slaves was less considerable in the North,
but the advantages resulting from slavery were not more con-
tested there than in the South. In 1740, the Legislature of
the State of New York declared that the direct importation
of slaves ought to be encouraged as much as possible, and
smuggling severely punished in order not to discourage the
fair trader. (Kent’s “Commentaries,” vol. ii. p. 206.) Curious
researches, by Belknap, upon slavery in New England, are to
be found in the “Historical Collection of Massachusetts,”
vol. iv. p. 193. It appears that negroes were introduced there
in 1630, but that the legislation and manners of the people
were opposed to slavery from the first; see also, in the same
work, the manner in which public opinion, and afterwards
the laws, finally put an end to slavery.

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three
Races – Part IV

But this truth was most satisfactorily demonstrated when
civilization reached the banks of the Ohio. The stream which
the Indians had distinguished by the name of Ohio, or Beau-
tiful River, waters one of the most magnificent valleys that
has ever been made the abode of man. Undulating lands
extend upon both shores of the Ohio, whose soil affords in-
exhaustible treasures to the laborer; on either bank the air is
wholesome and the climate mild, and each of them forms
the extreme frontier of a vast State: That which follows the
numerous windings of the Ohio upon the left is called Ken-
tucky, that upon the right bears the name of the river. These
two States only differ in a single respect; Kentucky has ad-
mitted slavery, but the State of Ohio has prohibited the ex-
istence of slaves within its borders.*

Thus the traveller who floats down the current of the Ohio
to the spot where that river falls into the Mississippi, may be

are allowed to enter the territory of that State, or to hold
property in it. See the Statutes of Ohio.

said to sail between liberty and servitude; and a transient

inspection of the surrounding objects will convince him as

to which of the two is most favorable to mankind. Upon the

left bank of the stream the population is rare; from time to

time one descries a troop of slaves loitering in the half-desert

fields; the primaeval forest recurs at every turn; society seems

to be asleep, man to be idle, and nature alone offers a scene

of activity and of life. From the right bank, on the contrary,

a confused hum is heard which proclaims the presence of

industry; the fields are covered with abundant harvests, the

elegance of the dwellings announces the taste and activity of

the laborer, and man appears to be in the enjoyment of that

wealth and contentment which is the reward of labor. *i

*The activity of Ohio is not confined to individuals, but the

undertakings of the State are surprisingly great; a canal has

been established between Lake Erie and the Ohio, by means

of which the valley of the Mississippi communicates with

the river of the North, and the European commodities which

arrive at New York may be forwarded by water to New Or-

leans across five hundred leagues of continent.

The State of Kentucky was founded in 1775, the State of
Ohio only twelve years later; but twelve years are more in
America than half a century in Europe, and, at the present
day, the population of Ohio exceeds that of Kentucky by
two hundred and fifty thousand souls.* These opposite con-
sequences of slavery and freedom may readily be understood,
and they suffice to explain many of the differences which we
remark between the civilization of antiquity and that of our
own time.
Upon the left bank of the Ohio labor is confounded with
the idea of slavery, upon the right bank it is identified with
that of prosperity and improvement; on the one side it is
degraded, on the other it is honored; on the former territory
no white laborers can be found, for they would be afraid of
assimilating themselves to the negroes; on the latter no one
is idle, for the white population extends its activity and its
intelligence to every kind of employment. Thus the men
whose task it is to cultivate the rich soil of Kentucky are
ignorant and lukewarm; whilst those who are active and en-

*The exact numbers given by the census of 1830 were: Ken-
tucky, 688,-844; Ohio, 937,679. [In 1890 the population
of Ohio was 3,672,316, that of Kentucky, 1,858,635.]

over that portion of the American territory where they have
less to fear from competition; they discover resources there
which escaped the notice of the inhabitants; and, as they
comply with a system which they do not approve, they suc-
ceed in turning it to better advantage than those who first
founded and who still maintain it.
Were I inclined to continue this parallel, I could easily
prove that almost all the differences which may be remarked
between the characters of the Americans in the Southern
and in the Northern States have originated in slavery; but
this would divert me from my subject, and my present in-
tention is not to point out all the consequences of servitude,
but those effects which it has produced upon the prosperity
of the countries which have admitted it.
The influence of slavery upon the production of wealth
must have been very imperfectly known in antiquity, as sla-
very then obtained throughout the civilized world; and the
nations which were unacquainted with it were barbarous.
And indeed Christianity only abolished slavery by advocat-
ing the claims of the slave; at the present time it may be
attacked in the name of the master, and, upon this point,

interest is reconciled with morality.
As these truths became apparent in the United States, sla-
very receded before the progress of experience. Servitude had
begun in the South, and had thence spread towards the North;
but it now retires again. Freedom, which started from the
North, now descends uninterruptedly towards the South.
Amongst the great States, Pennsylvania now constitutes the
extreme limit of slavery to the North: but even within those
limits the slave system is shaken: Maryland, which is imme-
diately below Pennsylvania, is preparing for its abolition; and
Virginia, which comes next to Maryland, is already discuss-
ing its utility and its dangers.*
*A peculiar reason contributes to detach the two last- men-
tioned States from the cause of slavery. The former wealth of
this part of the Union was principally derived from the cul-
tivation of tobacco. This cultivation is specially carried on
by slaves; but within the last few years the market-price of
tobacco has diminished, whilst the value of the slaves re-
mains the same. Thus the ratio between the cost of produc-
tion and the value of the produce is changed. The natives of
Maryland and Virginia are therefore more disposed than they
were thirty years ago, to give up slave labor in the cultivation
of tobacco, or to give up slavery and tobacco at the same
time.

many who were poor, but none who would work; its mem-
bers preferred want to labor, consequently no competition
was set on foot against negro laborers and slaves, and, what-
ever opinion might be entertained as to the utility of their
efforts, it was indispensable to employ them, since there was
no one else to work.
No sooner was the law of primogeniture abolished than
fortunes began to diminish, and all the families of the coun-
try were simultaneously reduced to a state in which labor
became necessary to procure the means of subsistence: sev-
eral of them have since entirely disappeared, and all of them
learned to look forward to the time at which it would be
necessary for everyone to provide for his own wants. Wealthy
individuals are still to be met with, but they no longer con-
stitute a compact and hereditary body, nor have they been
able to adopt a line of conduct in which they could perse-
vere, and which they could infuse into all ranks of society.
The prejudice which stigmatized labor was in the first place
abandoned by common consent; the number of needy men
was increased, and the needy were allowed to gain a labori-
ous subsistence without blushing for their exertions. Thus

one of the most immediate consequences of the partible qual-
ity of estates has been to create a class of free laborers. As
soon as a competition was set on foot between the free la-
borer and the slave, the inferiority of the latter became mani-
fest, and slavery was attacked in its fundamental principle,
which is the interest of the master.
As slavery recedes, the black population follows its retro-
grade course, and returns with it towards those tropical re-
gions from which it originally came. However singular this
fact may at first appear to be, it may readily be explained.
Although the Americans abolish the principle of slavery, they
do not set their slaves free. To illustrate this remark, I will
quote the example of the State of New York. In 1788, the
State of New York prohibited the sale of slaves within its
limits, which was an indirect method of prohibiting the im-
portation of blacks. Thenceforward the number of negroes
could only increase according to the ratio of the natural in-
crease of population. But eight years later a more decisive
measure was taken, and it was enacted that all children born
of slave parents after July 4, 1799, should be free. No in-
crease could then take place, and although slaves still ex-

him from one master to another, and from the North to the
South.
The emancipated negroes, and those born after the aboli-
tion of slavery, do not, indeed, migrate from the North to
the South; but their situation with regard to the Europeans
is not unlike that of the aborigines of America; they remain
half civilized, and deprived of their rights in the midst of a
population which is far superior to them in wealth and in
knowledge; where they are exposed to the tyranny of the
laws* and the intolerance of the people. On some accounts
they are still more to be pitied than the Indians, since they
are haunted by the reminiscence of slavery, and they cannot
claim possession of a single portion of the soil: many of them
perish miserably,** and the rest congregate in the great towns,

*The States in which slavery is abolished usually do what they can
to render their territory disagreeable to the negroes as a place of
residence; and as a kind of emulation exists between the different
States in this respect, the unhappy blacks can only choose the least
of the evils which beset them.
**There is a very great difference between the mortality of the
blacks and of the whites in the States in which slavery is abolished;
from 1820 to 1831 only one out of forty-two individuals of the
white population died in Philadelphia; but one negro out of twenty-
one individuals of the black population died in the same space of
time. The mortality is by no means so great amongst the negroes
who are still slaves. (See Emmerson’s “Medical Statistics,” p. 28.)

Thus the white population grows by its natural increase,
and at the same time by the immense influx of emigrants;
whilst the black population receives no emigrants, and is upon
its decline. The proportion which existed between the two
races is soon inverted. The negroes constitute a scanty rem-
nant, a poor tribe of vagrants, which is lost in the midst of
an immense people in full possession of the land; and the
presence of the blacks is only marked by the injustice and
the hardships of which they are the unhappy victims.
In several of the Western States the negro race never made
its appearance, and in all the Northern States it is rapidly
declining. Thus the great question of its future condition is
confined within a narrow circle, where it becomes less for-
midable, though not more easy of solution.
The more we descend towards the South, the more diffi-
cult does it become to abolish slavery with advantage: and
this arises from several physical causes which it is important
to point out.
The first of these causes is the climate; it is well known
that in proportion as Europeans approach the tropics they
suffer more from labor. Many of the Americans even assert

that within a certain latitude the exertions which a negro can
make without danger are fatal to them;* but I do not think
that this opinion, which is so favorable to the indolence of the
inhabitants of southern regions, is confirmed by experience.
The southern parts of the Union are not hotter than the South
of Italy and of Spain;** and it may be asked why the European
cannot work as well there as in the two latter countries. If
slavery has been abolished in Italy and in Spain without caus-
ing the destruction of the masters, why should not the same
*This is true of the spots in which rice is cultivated; rice-
grounds, which are unwholesome in all countries, are par-
ticularly dangerous in those regions which are exposed to
the beams of a tropical sun. Europeans would not find it
easy to cultivate the soil in that part of the New World if it
must be necessarily be made to produce rice; but may they
not subsist without rice-grounds?
**These States are nearer to the equator than Italy and Spain,
but the temperature of the continent of America is very much
lower than that of Europe.
The Spanish Government formerly caused a certain num-
ber of peasants from the Acores to be transported into a dis-
trict of Louisiana called Attakapas, by way of experiment.
These settlers still cultivate the soil without the assistance of
slaves, but their industry is so languid as scarcely to supply
their most necessary wants.

emigration of the negroes from the North; and the African
race has causes of increase in the South very analogous to
those which so powerfully accelerate the growth of the Eu-
ropean race in the North.
In the State of Maine there is one negro in 300 inhabit-
ants; in Massachusetts, one in 100; in New York, two in
100; in Pennsylvania, three in the same number; in Mary-
land, thirty-four; in Virginia, forty-two; and lastly, in South
Carolina* fifty-five per cent. Such was the proportion of the
black population to the whites in the year 1830. But this
proportion is perpetually changing, as it constantly decreases
in the North and augments in the South.
*We find it asserted in an American work, entitled “Letters on the
Colonization Society,” by Mr. Carey, 1833, “That for the last forty
years the black race has increased more rapidly than the white race
in the State of South Carolina; and that if we take the average
population of the five States of the South into which slaves were
first introduced, viz., Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, North
Carolina, and Georgia, we shall find that from 1790 to 1830 the
whites have augmented in the proportion of 80 to 100, and the
blacks in that of 112 to 100.”
In the United States, in 1830, the population of the two races
stood as follows: –
States where slavery is abolished, 6,565,434 whites; 120,520
blacks. Slave States, 3,960,814 whites; 2,208,102 blacks. [In 1890
the United States contained a population of 54,983,890 whites,
and 7,638,360 negroes.]

It is evident that the most Southern States of the Union
cannot abolish slavery without incurring very great dangers,
which the North had no reason to apprehend when it eman-
cipated its black population. We have already shown the sys-
tem by which the Northern States secure the transition from
slavery to freedom, by keeping the present generation in chains,
and setting their descendants free; by this means the negroes
are gradually introduced into society; and whilst the men who
might abuse their freedom are kept in a state of servitude,
those who are emancipated may learn the art of being free
before they become their own masters. But it would be diffi-
cult to apply this method in the South. To declare that all the
negroes born after a certain period shall be free, is to introduce
the principle and the notion of liberty into the heart of sla-
very; the blacks whom the law thus maintains in a state of
slavery from which their children are delivered, are astonished
at so unequal a fate, and their astonishment is only the pre-
lude to their impatience and irritation. Thenceforward slavery
loses, in their eyes, that kind of moral power which it derived
from time and habit; it is reduced to a mere palpable abuse of
force. The Northern States had nothing to fear from the con-

trast, because in them the blacks were few in number, and the
white population was very considerable. But if this faint dawn
of freedom were to show two millions of men their true posi-
tion, the oppressors would have reason to tremble. After hav-
ing affranchised the children of their slaves the Europeans of
the Southern States would very shortly be obliged to extend
the same benefit to the whole black population.

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition of Three Races
– Part V

In the North, as I have already remarked, a twofold migra-
tion ensues upon the abolition of slavery, or even precedes
that event when circumstances have rendered it probable;
the slaves quit the country to be transported southwards;
and the whites of the Northern States, as well as the emi-
grants from Europe, hasten to fill up their place. But these
two causes cannot operate in the same manner in the South-
ern States. On the one hand, the mass of slaves is too great
for any expectation of their ever being removed from the
country to be entertained; and on the other hand, the Eu-

As soon as it is admitted that the whites and the emanci-
pated blacks are placed upon the same territory in the situa-
tion of two alien communities, it will readily be understood
that there are but two alternatives for the future; the negroes
and the whites must either wholly part or wholly mingle. I
have already expressed the conviction which I entertain as to
the latter event.* I do not imagine that the white and black
races will ever live in any country upon an equal footing.
But I believe the difficulty to be still greater in the United
States than elsewhere. An isolated individual may surmount

in society; but a whole people cannot rise, as it were, above
itself. A despot who should subject the Americans and their
former slaves to the same yoke, might perhaps succeed in
commingling their races; but as long as the American de-
mocracy remains at the head of affairs, no one will under-
take so difficult a task; and it may be foreseen that the freer
the white population of the United States becomes, the more
isolated will it remain.*

I have previously observed that the mixed race is the true
bond of union between the Europeans and the Indians; just
so the mulattoes are the true means of transition between
the white and the negro; so that wherever mulattoes abound,
the intermixture of the two races is not impossible. In some
parts of America, the European and the negro races are so
crossed by one another, that it is rare to meet with a man
who is entirely black, or entirely white: when they are ar-
rived at this point, the two races may really be said to be
combined; or rather to have been absorbed in a third race,

*This opinion is sanctioned by authorities infinitely weightier
than anything that I can say: thus, for instance, it is stated in
the “Memoirs of Jefferson” (as collected by M. Conseil), “Noth-
ing is more clearly written in the book of destiny than the
emancipation of the blacks; and it is equally certain that the
two races will never live in a state of equal freedom under the
same government, so insurmountable are the barriers which
nature, habit, and opinions have established between them.”

they would assuredly not have passed the Slave Emancipa-

up arms. The fate of the white population of the Southern
States will, perhaps, be similar to that of the Moors in Spain.
After having occupied the land for centuries, it will perhaps
be forced to retire to the country whence its ancestors came,
and to abandon to the negroes the possession of a territory,
which Providence seems to have more peculiarly destined
for them, since they can subsist and labor in it more easily
that the whites.
The danger of a conflict between the white and the black
inhabitants of the Southern States of the Union – a danger
which, however remote it may be, is inevitable – perpetually
haunts the imagination of the Americans. The inhabitants
of the North make it a common topic of conversation, al-
though they have no direct injury to fear from the struggle;
but they vainly endeavor to devise some means of obviating
the misfortunes which they foresee. In the Southern States
the subject is not discussed: the planter does not allude to
the future in conversing with strangers; the citizen does not
communicate his apprehensions to his friends; he seeks to
conceal them from himself; but there is something more
alarming in the tacit forebodings of the South, than in the

clamorous fears of the Northern States.
This all-pervading disquietude has given birth to an un-
dertaking which is but little known, but which may have the
effect of changing the fate of a portion of the human race.
From apprehension of the dangers which I have just been
describing, a certain number of American citizens have
formed a society for the purpose of exporting to the coast of
Guinea, at their own expense, such free negroes as may be
willing to escape from the oppression to which they are sub-
ject.* In 1820, the society to which I allude formed a settle-
ment in Africa, upon the seventh degree of north latitude,
which bears the name of Liberia. The most recent intelli-
gence informs us that 2,500 negroes are collected there; they
have introduced the democratic institutions of America into
the country of their forefathers; and Liberia has a represen-
tative system of government, negro jurymen, negro magis-
trates, and negro priests; churches have been built, newspa-
*This society assumed the name of “The Society for the
Colonization of the Blacks.” See its annual reports; and more
particularly the fifteenth. See also the pamphlet, to which
allusion has already been made, entitled “Letters on the Colo-
nization Society, and on its probable Results,” by Mr. Carey,
Philadelphia, 1833.

pers established, and, by a singular change in the vicissitudes
of the world, white men are prohibited from sojourning
within the settlement.*

This is indeed a strange caprice of fortune. Two hundred
years have now elapsed since the inhabitants of Europe un-
dertook to tear the negro from his family and his home, in
order to transport him to the shores of North America; at
the present day, the European settlers are engaged in sending
back the descendants of those very negroes to the Continent
from which they were originally taken; and the barbarous
Africans have been brought into contact with civilization in
the midst of bondage, and have become acquainted with
free political institutions in slavery. Up to the present time
Africa has been closed against the arts and sciences of the
whites; but the inventions of Europe will perhaps penetrate
into those regions, now that they are introduced by Africans

themselves. The settlement of Liberia is founded upon a lofty
and a most fruitful idea; but whatever may be its results with
regard to the Continent of Africa, it can afford no remedy to
the New World.
In twelve years the Colonization Society has transported
2,500 negroes to Africa; in the same space of time about
700,000 blacks were born in the United States. If the colony
of Liberia were so situated as to be able to receive thousands
of new inhabitants every year, and if the negroes were in a
state to be sent thither with advantage; if the Union were to
supply the society with annual subsidies,* and to transport
the negroes to Africa in the vessels of the State, it would still

*This last regulation was laid down by the founders of the
settlement; they apprehended that a state of things might
arise in Africa similar to that which exists on the frontiers of
the United States, and that if the negroes, like the Indians,
were brought into collision with a people more enlightened
than themselves, they would be destroyed before they could
be civilized.

*Nor would these be the only difficulties attendant upon the
undertaking; if the Union undertook to buy up the negroes
now in America, in order to transport them to Africa, the
price of slaves, increasing with their scarcity, would soon
become enormous; and the States of the North would never
consent to expend such great sums for a purpose which would
procure such small advantages to themselves. If the Union
took possession of the slaves in the Southern States by force,
or at a rate determined by law, an insurmountable resistance
would arise in that part of the country. Both alternatives are
equally impossible.

be unable to counterpoise the natural increase of population
amongst the blacks; and as it could not remove as many men
in a year as are born upon its territory within the same space
of time, it would fail in suspending the growth of the evil
which is daily increasing in the States.* The negro race will
never leave those shores of the American continent, to which
it was brought by the passions and the vices of Europeans;
and it will not disappear from the New World as long as it
continues to exist. The inhabitants of the United States may
retard the calamities which they apprehend, but they cannot
now destroy their efficient cause.
I am obliged to confess that I do not regard the abolition
of slavery as a means of warding off the struggle of the two
races in the United States. The negroes may long remain
slaves without complaining; but if they are once raised to
the level of free men, they will soon revolt at being deprived
of all their civil rights; and as they cannot become the equals
of the whites, they will speedily declare themselves as en-

*In 1830 there were in the United States 2,010,327 slaves
and 319,439 free blacks, in all 2,329,766 negroes: which
formed about one-fifth of the total population of the United
States at that time.

races. Such is the view which the Americans of the South
take of the question, and they act consistently with it. As
they are determined not to mingle with the negroes, they
refuse to emancipate them.

Not that the inhabitants of the South regard slavery as nec-
essary to the wealth of the planter, for on this point many of
them agree with their Northern countrymen in freely ad-
mitting that slavery is prejudicial to their interest; but they
are convinced that, however prejudicial it may be, they hold
their lives upon no other tenure. The instruction which is
now diffused in the South has convinced the inhabitants that
slavery is injurious to the slave-owner, but it has also shown
them, more clearly than before, that no means exist of get-
ting rid of its bad consequences. Hence arises a singular con-
trast; the more the utility of slavery is contested, the more
firmly is it established in the laws; and whilst the principle of
servitude is gradually abolished in the North, that self-same
principle gives rise to more and more rigorous consequences
in the South.
The legislation of the Southern States with regard to slaves,

dence. The Europeans did imperfectly feel this truth, but
without acknowledging it even to themselves. Whenever they
have had to do with negroes, their conduct has either been
dictated by their interest and their pride, or by their com-
passion. They first violated every right of humanity by their
treatment of the negro and they afterwards informed him
that those rights were precious and inviolable. They affected
to open their ranks to the slaves, but the negroes who at-
tempted to penetrate into the community were driven back
with scorn; and they have incautiously and involuntarily been
led to admit of freedom instead of slavery, without having
the courage to be wholly iniquitous, or wholly just.
If it be impossible to anticipate a period at which the Ameri-
cans of the South will mingle their blood with that of the
negroes, can they allow their slaves to become free without
compromising their own security? And if they are obliged to
keep that race in bondage in order to save their own families,
may they not be excused for availing themselves of the means
best adapted to that end? The events which are taking place
in the Southern States of the Union appear to me to be at
once the most horrible and the most natural results of sla-
very. When I see the order of nature overthrown, and when
I hear the cry of humanity in its vain struggle against the
laws, my indignation does not light upon the men of our
own time who are the instruments of these outrages; but I

reserve my execration for those who, after a thousand years
of freedom, brought back slavery into the world once more.
Whatever may be the efforts of the Americans of the South
to maintain slavery, they will not always succeed. Slavery,
which is now confined to a single tract of the civilized earth,
which is attacked by Christianity as unjust, and by political
economy as prejudicial; and which is now contrasted with
democratic liberties and the information of our age, cannot
survive. By the choice of the master, or by the will of the
slave, it will cease; and in either case great calamities may be
expected to ensue. If liberty be refused to the negroes of the
South, they will in the end seize it for themselves by force; if
it be given, they will abuse it ere long.*
*This chapter is no longer applicable to the condition of the
negro race in the United States, since the abolition of slavery
was the result, though not the object, of the great Civil War,
and the negroes have been raised to the condition not only
of freedmen, but of citizens; and in some States they exercise
a preponderating political power by reason of their numeri-
cal majority. Thus, in South Carolina there were in 1870,
289,667 whites and 415,814 blacks. But the emancipation
of the slaves has not solved the problem, how two races so
different and so hostile are to live together in peace in one
country on equal terms. That problem is as difficult, per-
haps more difficult than ever; and to this difficulty the author’s
remarks are still perfectly applicable.

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition of Three Races
– Part VI

What Are the Chances in Favor of the Duration of the
American Union, and What Dangers Threaten It*

*This chapter is one of the most curious and interesting por-
tions of the work, because it embraces almost all the consti-
tutional and social questions which were raised by the great
secession of the South and decided by the results of the Civil
War. But it must be confessed that the sagacity of the author
is sometimes at fault in these speculations, and did not save
him from considerable errors, which the course of events has
since made apparent. He held that “the legislators of the
Constitution of 1789 were not appointed to constitute the
government of a single people, but to regulate the associa-
tion of several States; that the Union was formed by the vol-
untary agreement of the States, and in uniting together they
have not forfeited their nationality, nor have they been re-
duced to the condition of one and the same people.” Whence
he inferred that “if one of the States chose to withdraw its

name from the contract, it would be difficult to disprove its
right of doing so; and that the Federal Government would
have no means of maintaining its claims directly, either by
force or by right.” This is the Southern theory of the Consti-
tution, and the whole case of the South in favor of secession.
To many Europeans, and to some American (Northern) ju-
rists, this view appeared to be sound; but it was vigorously
resisted by the North, and crushed by force of arms.
The author of this book was mistaken in supposing that
the “Union was a vast body which presents no definite ob-
ject to patriotic feeling.” When the day of trial came, mil-
lions of men were ready to lay down their lives for it. He was
also mistaken in supposing that the Federal Executive is so
weak that it requires the free consent of the governed to en-
able it to subsist, and that it would be defeated in a struggle
to maintain the Union against one or more separate States.
In 1861 nine States, with a population of 8,753,000, se-
ceded, and maintained for four years a resolute but unequal
contest for independence, but they were defeated.
Lastly, the author was mistaken in supposing that a com-
munity of interests would always prevail between North and

tude.” The emancipation of several millions of negro slaves
without compensation, and the transfer to them of political
preponderance in the States in which they outnumber the
white population, were acts of the North totally opposed to
the interests of the South, and which could only have been
carried into effect by conquest. –Translator’s Note.

Reason for which the preponderating force lies in the States
rather than in the Union – The Union will only last as long
as all the States choose to belong to it – Causes which tend
to keep them united – Utility of the Union to resist foreign
enemies, and to prevent the existence of foreigners in America
– No natural barriers between the several States – No con-
flicting interests to divide them – Reciprocal interests of the
Northern, Southern, and Western States – Intellectual ties
of union – Uniformity of opinions – Dangers of the Union
resulting from the different characters and the passions of its
citizens – Character of the citizens in the South and in the
North – The rapid growth of the Union one of its greatest
dangers – Progress of the population to the Northwest –

from sudden turns of fortune – Whether the existing Gov-
ernment of the Union tends to gain strength, or to lose it -
Various signs of its decrease – Internal improvements – Waste
lands – Indians – The Bank – The Tariff – General Jackson.

The maintenance of the existing institutions of the several
States depends in some measure upon the maintenance of
the Union itself. It is therefore important in the first instance
to inquire into the probable fate of the Union. One point
may indeed be assumed at once: if the present confederation
were dissolved, it appears to me to be incontestable that the
States of which it is now composed would not return to their
original isolated condition, but that several unions would
then be formed in the place of one. It is not my intention to
inquire into the principles upon which these new unions
would probably be established, but merely to show what the
causes are which may effect the dismemberment of the exist-
ing confederation.
With this object I shall be obliged to retrace some of the
steps which I have already taken, and to revert to topics which
I have before discussed. I am aware that the reader may ac-

which can only be properly treated in that locality. Such, for
instance, is the budget of a municipality. Lastly, there are cer-
tain objects of a mixed nature, which are national inasmuch as
they affect all the citizens who compose the nation, and which
are provincial inasmuch as it is not necessary that the nation
itself should provide for them all. Such are the rights which
regulate the civil and political condition of the citizens. No
society can exist without civil and political rights. These rights
therefore interest all the citizens alike; but it is not always nec-
essary to the existence and the prosperity of the nation that
these rights should be uniform, nor, consequently, that they
should be regulated by the central authority.
There are, then, two distinct categories of objects which
are submitted to the direction of the sovereign power; and
these categories occur in all well-constituted communities,
whatever the basis of the political constitution may other-
wise be. Between these two extremes the objects which I have
termed mixed may be considered to lie. As these objects are
neither exclusively national nor entirely provincial, they may
be obtained by a national or by a provincial government,
according to the agreement of the contracting parties, with-

out in any way impairing the contract of association.
The sovereign power is usually formed by the union of
separate individuals, who compose a people; and individual
powers or collective forces, each representing a very small
portion of the sovereign authority, are the sole elements which
are subjected to the general Government of their choice. In
this case the general Government is more naturally called
upon to regulate, not only those affairs which are of essential
national importance, but those which are of a more local
interest; and the local governments are reduced to that small
share of sovereign authority which is indispensable to their
prosperity.
But sometimes the sovereign authority is composed of
preorganized political bodies, by virtue of circumstances an-
terior to their union; and in this case the provincial govern-
ments assume the control, not only of those affairs which
more peculiarly belong to their province, but of all, or of a
part of the mixed affairs to which allusion has been made.
For the confederate nations which were independent sover-
eign States before their union, and which still represent a
very considerable share of the sovereign power, have only

consented to cede to the general Government the exercise of
those rights which are indispensable to the Union.
When the national Government, independently of the pre-
rogatives inherent in its nature, is invested with the right of
regulating the affairs which relate partly to the general and
partly to the local interests, it possesses a preponderating in-
fluence. Not only are its own rights extensive, but all the
rights which it does not possess exist by its sufferance, and it
may be apprehended that the provincial governments may
be deprived of their natural and necessary prerogatives by its
influence.
When, on the other hand, the provincial governments are
invested with the power of regulating those same affairs of
mixed interest, an opposite tendency prevails in society. The
preponderating force resides in the province, not in the na-
tion; and it may be apprehended that the national Govern-
ment may in the end be stripped of the privileges which are
necessary to its existence.
Independent nations have therefore a natural tendency to
centralization, and confederations to dismemberment.
It now only remains for us to apply these general prin-

and, in conformity with the natural tendency of the human
mind, they are more likely to attach themselves to the former
than to the latter. In this respect their habits and feelings
harmonize with their interests.

When a compact nation divides its sovereignty, and adopts a
confederate form of government, the traditions, the customs,
and the manners of the people are for a long time at variance
with their legislation; and the former tend to give a degree of
influence to the central government which the latter forbids.
When a number of confederate states unite to form a single
nation, the same causes operate in an opposite direction. I
have no doubt that if France were to become a confederate
republic like that of the United States, the government would
at first display more energy than that of the Union; and if
the Union were to alter its constitution to a monarchy like
that of France, I think that the American Government would
be a long time in acquiring the force which now rules the
latter nation. When the national existence of the Anglo-
Americans began, their provincial existence was already of
long standing; necessary relations were established between

the tone of the Federal Government in its intercourse with
individuals, but no sooner has it anything to do with a State
than it begins to parley, to explain its motives and to justify its
conduct, to argue, to advise, and, in short, anything but to
command. If doubts are raised as to the limits of the constitu-
tional powers of each government, the provincial government
prefers its claim with boldness, and takes prompt and ener-
getic steps to support it. In the mean while the Government
of the Union reasons; it appeals to the interests, to the good
sense, to the glory of the nation; it temporizes, it negotiates,
and does not consent to act until it is reduced to the last ex-
tremity. At first sight it might readily be imagined that it is the
provincial government which is armed with the authority of
the nation, and that Congress represents a single State.
The Federal Government is, therefore, notwithstanding
the precautions of those who founded it, naturally so weak
that it more peculiarly requires the free consent of the gov-
erned to enable it to subsist. It is easy to perceive that its
object is to enable the States to realize with facility their de-
termination of remaining united; and, as long as this pre-
liminary condition exists, its authority is great, temperate,

and effective. The Constitution fits the Government to con-

trol individuals, and easily to surmount such obstacles as they

may be inclined to offer; but it was by no means established

with a view to the possible separation of one or more of the

States from the Union.

If the sovereignty of the Union were to engage in a struggle

with that of the States at the present day, its defeat may be

confidently predicted; and it is not probable that such a

struggle would be seriously undertaken. As often as a steady

resistance is offered to the Federal Government it will be

found to yield. Experience has hitherto shown that when-

ever a State has demanded anything with perseverance and

resolution, it has invariably succeeded; and that if a separate

government has distinctly refused to act, it was left to do as

it thought fit.*

But even if the Government of the Union had any strength

inherent in itself, the physical situation of the country would

render the exercise of that strength very difficult.* The United

States cover an immense territory; they are separated from
each other by great distances; and the population is dissemi-
nated over the surface of a country which is still half a wil-
derness. If the Union were to undertake to enforce the alle-
giance of the confederate States by military means, it would
be in a position very analogous to that of England at the
time of the War of Independence.
However strong a government may be, it cannot easily es-
cape from the consequences of a principle which it has once
admitted as the foundation of its constitution. The Union
was formed by the voluntary agreement of the States; and,
in uniting together, they have not forfeited their nationality,
nor have they been reduced to the condition of one and the
same people. If one of the States chose to withdraw its name
from the contract, it would be difficult to disprove its right

*See the conduct of the Northern States in the war of 1812.
“During that war,” says Jefferson in a letter to General
Lafayette, “four of the Eastern States were only attached to
the Union, like so many inanimate bodies to living men.”

*The profound peace of the Union affords no pretext for a
standing army; and without a standing army a government
is not prepared to profit by a favorable opportunity to con-
quer resistance, and take the sovereign power by surprise.
[This note, and the paragraph in the text which precedes,
have been shown by the results of the Civil War to be a mis-
conception of the writer.]

of doing so; and the Federal Government would have no
means of maintaining its claims directly, either by force or
by right. In order to enable the Federal Government easily
to conquer the resistance which may be offered to it by any
one of its subjects, it would be necessary that one or more of
them should be specially interested in the existence of the
Union, as has frequently been the case in the history of con-
federations.
If it be supposed that amongst the States which are united
by the federal tie there are some which exclusively enjoy the
principal advantages of union, or whose prosperity depends
on the duration of that union, it is unquestionable that they
will always be ready to support the central Government in
enforcing the obedience of the others. But the Government
would then be exerting a force not derived from itself, but
from a principle contrary to its nature. States form confed-
erations in order to derive equal advantages from their union;
and in the case just alluded to, the Federal Government would
derive its power from the unequal distribution of those ben-
efits amongst the States.
If one of the confederate States have acquired a prepon-

derance sufficiently great to enable it to take exclusive pos-
session of the central authority, it will consider the other States
as subject provinces, and it will cause its own supremacy to
be respected under the borrowed name of the sovereignty of
the Union. Great things may then be done in the name of
the Federal Government, but in reality that Government will
have ceased to exist.* In both these cases, the power which
acts in the name of the confederation becomes stronger the
more it abandons the natural state and the acknowledged
principles of confederations.
In America the existing Union is advantageous to all the
States, but it is not indispensable to any one of them. Several
of them might break the federal tie without compromising
the welfare of the others, although their own prosperity would
be lessened. As the existence and the happiness of none of
the States are wholly dependent on the present Constitu-
tion, they would none of them be disposed to make great

*Thus the province of Holland in the republic of the Low
Countries, and the Emperor in the Germanic Confedera-
tion, have sometimes put themselves in the place of the union,
and have employed the federal authority to their own ad-
vantage.

New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia comprise them within
their borders, and they extend as much to the west as to the
east of the line. The territory now occupied by the twenty-
four States of the Union, and the three great districts which
have not yet acquired the rank of States, although they al-
ready contain inhabitants, covers a surface of 1,002,600
square miles,* which is about equal to five times the extent
of France. Within these limits the qualities of the soil, the
temperature, and the produce of the country, are extremely
various. The vast extent of territory occupied by the Anglo-
American republics has given rise to doubts as to the main-
tenance of their Union. Here a distinction must be made;
contrary interests sometimes arise in the different provinces
*See “Darby’s View of the United States,” p. 435. [In 1890
the number of States and Territories had increased to 51, the
population to 62,831,900, and the area of the States,
3,602,990 square miles. This does not include the Philip-
pine Islands, Hawaii, or Porto Rico. A conservative estimate
of the population of the Philippine Islands is 8,000,000; that
of Hawaii, by the census of 1897, was given at 109,020; and
the present estimated population of Porto Rico is 900,000.
The area of the Philippine Islands is about 120,000 square
miles, that of Hawaii is 6,740 square miles, and the area of
Porto Rico is about 3,600 square miles.]

of a vast empire, which often terminate in open dissensions;
and the extent of the country is then most prejudicial to the
power of the State. But if the inhabitants of these vast re-
gions are not divided by contrary interests, the extent of the
territory may be favorable to their prosperity; for the unity
of the government promotes the interchange of the different
productions of the soil, and increases their value by facilitat-
ing their consumption.
It is indeed easy to discover different interests in the differ-
ent parts of the Union, but I am unacquainted with any
which are hostile to each other. The Southern States are al-
most exclusively agricultural. The Northern States are more
peculiarly commercial and manufacturing. The States of the
West are at the same time agricultural and manufacturing.
In the South the crops consist of tobacco, of rice, of cotton,
and of sugar; in the North and the West, of wheat and maize.
These are different sources of wealth; but union is the means
by which these sources are opened to all, and rendered equally
advantageous to the several districts.
The North, which ships the produce of the Anglo-Ameri-
cans to all parts of the world, and brings back the produce of

central America. The North cannot but desire the mainte-
nance of the Union, in order to remain, as it now is, the
connecting link between that vast body and the other parts
of the world.
The temporal interests of all the several parts of the Union
are, then, intimately connected; and the same assertion holds
true respecting those opinions and sentiments which may be
termed the immaterial interests of men.

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition of Three Races
– Part VII

The inhabitants of the United States talk a great deal of their
attachment to their country; but I confess that I do not rely
upon that calculating patriotism which is founded upon in-
terest, and which a change in the interests at stake may oblit-
erate. Nor do I attach much importance to the language of
the Americans, when they manifest, in their daily conversa-
tions, the intention of maintaining the federal system adopted
by their forefathers. A government retains its sway over a
great number of citizens, far less by the voluntary and ratio-

nal consent of the multitude, than by that instinctive, and to a
certain extent involuntary agreement, which results from simi-
larity of feelings and resemblances of opinion. I will never ad-
mit that men constitute a social body, simply because they
obey the same head and the same laws. Society can only exist
when a great number of men consider a great number of things
in the same point of view; when they hold the same opinions
upon many subjects, and when the same occurrences suggest
the same thoughts and impressions to their minds.
The observer who examines the present condition of the
United States upon this principle, will readily discover, that
although the citizens are divided into twenty-four distinct
sovereignties, they nevertheless constitute a single people;
and he may perhaps be led to think that the state of the
Anglo-American Union is more truly a state of society than
that of certain nations of Europe which live under the same
legislation and the same prince.
Although the Anglo-Americans have several religious sects,
they all regard religion in the same manner. They are not
always agreed upon the measures which are most conducive
to good government, and they vary upon some of the forms

of government which it is expedient to adopt; but they are
unanimous upon the general principles which ought to rule
human society. From Maine to the Floridas, and from the
Missouri to the Atlantic Ocean, the people is held to be the
legitimate source of all power. The same notions are enter-
tained respecting liberty and equality, the liberty of the press,
the right of association, the jury, and the responsibility of
the agents of Government.
If we turn from their political and religious opinions to
the moral and philosophical principles which regulate the
daily actions of life and govern their conduct, we shall still
find the same uniformity. The Anglo-Americans* acknowl-
edge the absolute moral authority of the reason of the com-
munity, as they acknowledge the political authority of the
mass of citizens; and they hold that public opinion is the
surest arbiter of what is lawful or forbidden, true or false.
The majority of them believe that a man will be led to do

* It is scarcely necessary for me to observe that by the expres-
sion Anglo-Americans, I only mean to designate the great
majority of the nation; for a certain number of isolated indi-
viduals are of course to be met with holding very different
opinions.

opinion of their superiority, and they are not very remote
from believing themselves to belong to a distinct race of
mankind.
The dangers which threaten the American Union do not
originate in the diversity of interests or of opinions, but in
the various characters and passions of the Americans. The
men who inhabit the vast territory of the United States are
almost all the issue of a common stock; but the effects of the
climate, and more especially of slavery, have gradually intro-
duced very striking differences between the British settler of
the Southern States and the British settler of the North. In
Europe it is generally believed that slavery has rendered the
interests of one part of the Union contrary to those of an-
other part; but I by no means remarked this to be the case:
slavery has not created interests in the South contrary to those
of the North, but it has modified the character and changed
the habits of the natives of the South.
I have already explained the influence which slavery has
exercised upon the commercial ability of the Americans in
the South; and this same influence equally extends to their
manners. The slave is a servant who never remonstrates, and

who submits to everything without complaint. He may some-
times assassinate, but he never withstands, his master. In the
South there are no families so poor as not to have slaves. The
citizen of the Southern States of the Union is invested with a
sort of domestic dictatorship, from his earliest years; the first
notion he acquires in life is that he is born to command, and
the first habit which he contracts is that of being obeyed
without resistance. His education tends, then, to give him
the character of a supercilious and a hasty man; irascible,
violent, and ardent in his desires, impatient of obstacles, but
easily discouraged if he cannot succeed upon his first attempt.
The American of the Northern States is surrounded by no
slaves in his childhood; he is even unattended by free ser-
vants, and is usually obliged to provide for his own wants.
No sooner does he enter the world than the idea of necessity
assails him on every side: he soon learns to know exactly the
natural limit of his authority; he never expects to subdue
those who withstand him, by force; and he knows that the
surest means of obtaining the support of his fellow-creatures,
is to win their favor. He therefore becomes patient, reflect-
ing, tolerant, slow to act, and persevering in his designs.

each of its members, whilst individual egotism is the source
of general happiness.
The citizen of the North has not only experience, but
knowledge: nevertheless he sets but little value upon the plea-
sures of knowledge; he esteems it as the means of attaining a
certain end, and he is only anxious to seize its more lucrative
applications. The citizen of the South is more given to act
upon impulse; he is more clever, more frank, more generous,
more intellectual, and more brilliant. The former, with a
greater degree of activity, of common-sense, of information,
and of general aptitude, has the characteristic good and evil
qualities of the middle classes. The latter has the tastes, the
prejudices, the weaknesses, and the magnanimity of all aris-
tocracies. If two men are united in society, who have the
same interests, and to a certain extent the same opinions,
but different characters, different acquirements, and a dif-
ferent style of civilization, it is probable that these men will
not agree. The same remark is applicable to a society of na-
tions. Slavery, then, does not attack the American Union
directly in its interests, but indirectly in its manners.
The States which gave their assent to the federal contract

in 1790 were thirteen in number; the Union now consists of
thirty-four members. The population, which amounted to
nearly 4,000,000 in 1790, had more than tripled in the space
of forty years; and in 1830 it amounted to nearly
13,000,000.* Changes of such magnitude cannot take place
without some danger.
A society of nations, as well as a society of individuals,
derives its principal chances of duration from the wisdom of
its members, their individual weakness, and their limited
number. The Americans who quit the coasts of the Atlantic
Ocean to plunge into the western wilderness, are adventur-
ers impatient of restraint, greedy of wealth, and frequently
men expelled from the States in which they were born. When
they arrive in the deserts they are unknown to each other,
and they have neither traditions, family feeling, nor the force
of example to check their excesses. The empire of the laws is
feeble amongst them; that of morality is still more power-
less. The settlers who are constantly peopling the valley of
the Mississippi are, then, in every respect very inferior to the
Americans who inhabit the older parts of the Union. Nev-

*Census of 1790, 3,929,328; 1830, 12,856,165; 1860,

ertheless, they already exercise a great influence in its coun-
cils; and they arrive at the government of the commonwealth
before they have learnt to govern themselves.*

The greater the individual weakness of each of the contracting
parties, the greater are the chances of the duration of the contract;
for their safety is then dependent upon their union. When, in
1790, the most populous of the American republics did not con-
tain 500,000 inhabitants,** each of them felt its own insignifi-
cance as an independent people, and this feeling rendered compli-
ance with the federal authority more easy. But when one of the
confederate States reckons, like the State of New York, 2,000,000
of inhabitants, and covers an extent of territory equal in surface to
a quarter of France,*** it feels its own strength; and although it
may continue to support the Union as advantageous to its pros-
perity, it no longer regards that body as necessary to its existence,
and as it continues to belong to the federal compact, it soon aims
at preponderance in the federal assemblies. The probable unanimity
of the States is diminished as their number increases. At present
the interests of the different parts of the Union are not at variance;
but who is able to foresee the multifarious changes of the future,

in a country in which towns are founded from day to day, and
States almost from year to year?
Since the first settlement of the British colonies, the number of
inhabitants has about doubled every twenty-two years. I perceive
no causes which are likely to check this progressive increase of the
Anglo-American population for the next hundred years; and be-
fore that space of time has elapsed, I believe that the territories
and dependencies of the United States will be covered by more
than 100,000,000 of inhabitants, and divided into forty States.* I
admit that these 100,000,000 of men have no ho hostile
interests. I suppose, on the contrary, that they are all equally
interested in the maintenance of the Union; but I am still of
opinion that where there are 100,000,000 of men, and forty

*This indeed is only a temporary danger. I have no doubt
that in time society will assume as much stability and regu-
larity in the West as it has already done upon the coast of the
Atlantic Ocean.
**Pennsylvania contained 431,373 inhabitants in 1790 [and
5,258,014 in 1890.]
*** The area of the State of New York is 49,170 square miles.
[See U. S. census report of 1890.]

*If the population continues to double every twenty-two years, as it has
done for the last two hundred years, the number of inhabitants in the
United States in 1852 will be twenty millions; in 1874, forty-eight mil-
lions; and in 1896, ninety-six millions. This may still be the case even if
the lands on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains should be found
to be unfit for cultivation. The territory which is already occupied can
easily contain this number of inhabitants. One hundred millions of men
disseminated over the surface of the twenty-four States, and the three
dependencies, which constitute the Union, would only give 762 inhab-
itants to the square league; this would be far below the mean population
of France, which is 1,063 to the square league; or of England, which is
1,457; and it would even be below the population of Switzerland, for
that country, notwithstanding its lakes and mountains, contains 783
inhabitants to the square league. See “Malte Brun,” vol. vi. p. 92. [The
actual result has fallen somewhat short of these calculations, in spite of
the vast territorial acquisitions of the United States: but in 1899 the
population is probably about eighty- seven millions, including the popu-
lation of the Philippines, Hawaii, and Porto Rico.]

distinct nations, unequally strong, the continuance of the
Federal Government can only be a fortunate accident.
Whatever faith I may have in the perfectibility of man,
until human nature is altered, and men wholly transformed,
I shall refuse to believe in the duration of a government which
is called upon to hold together forty different peoples, dis-
seminated over a territory equal to one-half of Europe in
extent; to avoid all rivalry, ambition, and struggles between
them, and to direct their independent activity to the accom-
plishment of the same designs.
But the greatest peril to which the Union is exposed by its
increase arises from the continual changes which take place
in the position of its internal strength. The distance from
Lake Superior to the Gulf of Mexico extends from the 47th
to the 30th degree of latitude, a distance of more than 1,200
miles as the bird flies. The frontier of the United States winds
along the whole of this immense line, sometimes falling
within its limits, but more frequently extending far beyond
it, into the waste. It has been calculated that the whites ad-
vance every year a mean distance of seventeen miles along
the whole of his vast boundary.* Obstacles, such as an un-

productive district, a lake or an Indian nation unexpectedly
encountered, are sometimes met with. The advancing col-
umn then halts for a while; its two extremities fall back upon
themselves, and as soon as they are reunited they proceed
onwards. This gradual and continuous progress of the Euro-
pean race towards the Rocky Mountains has the solemnity
of a providential event; it is like a deluge of men rising
unabatedly, and daily driven onwards by the hand of God.
Within this first line of conquering settlers towns are built,
and vast States founded. In 1790 there were only a few thou-
sand pioneers sprinkled along the valleys of the Mississippi;
and at the present day these valleys contain as many inhabit-
ants as were to be found in the whole Union in 1790. Their
population amounts to nearly 4,000,000.* The city of Wash-
ington was founded in 1800, in the very centre of the Union;
but such are the changes which have taken place, that it now
stands at one of the extremities; and the delegates of the most
remote Western States are already obliged to perform a jour-
ney as long as that from Vienna to Paris.**

*See Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, p. 105.

*3,672,317 – Census of 1830.
**The distance from Jefferson, the capital of the State of Missouri,
to Washington is 1,019 miles. (“American Almanac,” 1831, p. 48.)

All the States are borne onwards at the same time in the
path of fortune, but of course they do not all increase and
prosper in the same proportion. To the North of the Union
the detached branches of the Alleghany chain, which extend
as far as the Atlantic Ocean, form spacious roads and ports,
which are constantly accessible to vessels of the greatest bur-
den. But from the Potomac to the mouth of the Mississippi
the coast is sandy and flat. In this part of the Union the
mouths of almost all the rivers are obstructed; and the few
harbors which exist amongst these lagoons afford much shal-
lower water to vessels, and much fewer commercial advan-
tages than those of the North.
This first natural cause of inferiority is united to another
cause proceeding from the laws. We have already seen that
slavery, which is abolished in the North, still exists in the
South; and I have pointed out its fatal consequences upon
the prosperity of the planter himself.
The North is therefore superior to the South both in com-
merce *m and manufacture; the natural consequence of which
*The following statements will suffice to show the differ-
ence which exists between the commerce of the South and
that of the North: –

In 1829 the tonnage of all the merchant vessels belonging
to Virginia, the two Carolinas, and Georgia (the four great
Southern States), amounted to only 5,243 tons. In the same
year the tonnage of the vessels of the State of Massachusetts
alone amounted to 17,322 tons. (See Legislative Documents,
21st Congress, 2d session, No. 140, p. 244.) Thus the State
of Massachusetts had three times as much shipping as the
four above-mentioned States. Nevertheless the area of the
State of Massachusetts is only 7,335 square miles, and its
population amounts to 610,014 inhabitants [2,238,943 in
1890]; whilst the area of the four other States I have quoted
is 210,000 square miles, and their population 3,047,767.
Thus the area of the State of Massachusetts forms only one-
thirtieth part of the area of the four States; and its popula-
tion is five times smaller than theirs. (See “Darby’s View of
the United States.”) Slavery is prejudicial to the commercial
prosperity of the South in several different ways; by dimin-
ishing the spirit of enterprise amongst the whites, and by
preventing them from meeting with as numerous a class of
sailors as they require. Sailors are usually taken from the lowest
ranks of the population. But in the Southern States these
lowest ranks are composed of slaves, and it is very difficult to
employ them at sea. They are unable to serve as well as a
white crew, and apprehensions would always be entertained
of their mutinying in the middle of the ocean, or of their
escaping in the foreign countries at which they might touch.

is the more rapid increase of population and of wealth within
its borders. The States situate upon the shores of the Atlantic
Ocean are already half-peopled. Most of the land is held by
an owner; and these districts cannot therefore receive so many
emigrants as the Western States, where a boundless field is
still open to their exertions. The valley of the Mississippi is
far more fertile than the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. This
reason, added to all the others, contributes to drive the Eu-
ropeans westward – a fact which may be rigorously demon-
strated by figures. It is found that the sum total of the popu-
lation of all the United States has about tripled in the course
of forty years. But in the recent States adjacent to the Missis-
sippi, the population has increased thirty-one-fold, within
the same space of time.*

The relative position of the central federal power is con-
tinually displaced. Forty years ago the majority of the citi-
zens of the Union was established upon the coast of the At-
lantic, in the environs of the spot upon which Washington
now stands; but the great body of the people is now advanc-
ing inland and to the north, so that in twenty years the ma-
jority will unquestionably be on the western side of the

Alleghanies. If the Union goes on to subsist, the basin of the
Mississippi is evidently marked out, by its fertility and its
extent, as the future centre of the Federal Government. In
thirty or forty years, that tract of country will have assumed
the rank which naturally belongs to it. It is easy to calculate
that its population, compared to that of the coast of the At-
lantic, will be, in round numbers, as 40 to 11. In a few years
the States which founded the Union will lose the direction
of its policy, and the population of the valley of the Missis-
sippi will preponderate in the federal assemblies.
This constant gravitation of the federal power and influ-
ence towards the northwest is shown every ten years, when a
general census of the population is made, and the number of
delegates which each State sends to Congress is settled afresh.*

*It may be seen that in the course of the last ten years (1820-
1830) the population of one district, as, for instance, the
State of Delaware, has increased in the proportion of five per
cent.; whilst that of another, as the territory of Michigan,
has increased 250 per cent. Thus the population of Virginia
had augmented thirteen per cent., and that of the border
State of Ohio sixty-one per cent., in the same space of time.
The general table of these changes, which is given in the
“National Calendar,” displays a striking picture of the un-
equal fortunes of the different States.

In 1790 Virginia had nineteen representatives in Congress.
This number continued to increase until the year 1813, when
it reached to twenty-three; from that time it began to de-
crease, and in 1833 Virginia elected only twenty-one repre-
sentatives.* During the same period the State of New York
progressed in the contrary direction: in 1790 it had ten rep-
resentatives in Congress; in 1813, twenty-seven; in 1823,
thirty-four; and in 1833, forty. The State of Ohio had only
one representative in 1803, and in 1833 it had already nine-
teen.

*It has just been said that in the course of the last term the
population of Virginia has increased thirteen per cent.; and
it is necessary to explain how the number of representatives
for a State may decrease, when the population of that State,
far from diminishing, is actually upon the increase. I take
the State of Virginia, to which I have already alluded, as my
term of comparison. The number of representatives of Vir-
ginia in 1823 was proportionate to the total number of the
representatives of the Union, and to the relation which the
population bore to that of the whole Union: in 1833 the

number of representatives of Virginia was likewise propor-
tionate to the total number of the representatives of the
Union, and to the relation which its population, augmented
in the course of ten years, bore to the augmented population
of the Union in the same space of time. The new number of
Virginian representatives will then be to the old numver, on
the one hand, as the new numver of all the representatives is
to the old number; and, on the other hand, as the augmen-
tation of the population of Virginia is to that of the whole
population of the country. Thus, if the increase of the popu-
lation of the lesser country be to that of the greater in an
exact inverse ratio of the proportion between the new and
the old numbers of all the representatives, the number of the
representatives of Virginia will remain stationary; and if the
increase of the Virginian population be to that of the whole
Union in a feeblerratio than the new number of the repre-
sentatives of the Union to the old number, the number of
the representatives of Virginia must decrease. [Thus, to the
56th Congress in 1899, Virginia and West Virginia send only
fourteen representatives.

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition of Three Races
– Part VII

The inhabitants of the United States talk a great deal of their
attachment to their country; but I confess that I do not rely
upon that calculating patriotism which is founded upon in-
terest, and which a change in the interests at stake may oblit-
erate. Nor do I attach much importance to the language of
the Americans, when they manifest, in their daily conversa-
tions, the intention of maintaining the federal system adopted
by their forefathers. A government retains its sway over a
great number of citizens, far less by the voluntary and ratio-
nal consent of the multitude, than by that instinctive, and to
a certain extent involuntary agreement, which results from
similarity of feelings and resemblances of opinion. I will never
admit that men constitute a social body, simply because they
obey the same head and the same laws. Society can only
exist when a great number of men consider a great number
of things in the same point of view; when they hold the same
opinions upon many subjects, and when the same occur-
rences suggest the same thoughts and impressions to their

minds.
The observer who examines the present condition of the
United States upon this principle, will readily discover, that
although the citizens are divided into twenty-four distinct
sovereignties, they nevertheless constitute a single people;
and he may perhaps be led to think that the state of the
Anglo-American Union is more truly a state of society than
that of certain nations of Europe which live under the same
legislation and the same prince.
Although the Anglo-Americans have several religious sects,
they all regard religion in the same manner. They are not
always agreed upon the measures which are most conducive
to good government, and they vary upon some of the forms
of government which it is expedient to adopt; but they are
unanimous upon the general principles which ought to rule
human society. From Maine to the Floridas, and from the
Missouri to the Atlantic Ocean, the people is held to be the
legitimate source of all power. The same notions are enter-
tained respecting liberty and equality, the liberty of the press,
the right of association, the jury, and the responsibility of
the agents of Government.

If we turn from their political and religious opinions to
the moral and philosophical principles which regulate the
daily actions of life and govern their conduct, we shall still
find the same uniformity. The Anglo-Americans* acknowl-
edge the absolute moral authority of the reason of the com-
munity, as they acknowledge the political authority of the
mass of citizens; and they hold that public opinion is the
surest arbiter of what is lawful or forbidden, true or false.
The majority of them believe that a man will be led to do
what is just and good by following his own interest rightly
understood. They hold that every man is born in possession
of the right of self-government, and that no one has the right
of constraining his fellow-creatures to be happy. They have
all a lively faith in the perfectibility of man; they are of opin-
ion that the effects of the diffusion of knowledge must nec-
essarily be advantageous, and the consequences of ignorance
fatal; they all consider society as a body in a state of improve-

*It is scarcely necessary for me to observe that by the expres-
sion Anglo-Americans, I only mean to designate the great
majority of the nation; for a certain number of isolated indi-
viduals are of course to be met with holding very different
opinions.

violent, and ardent in his desires, impatient of obstacles, but
easily discouraged if he cannot succeed upon his first attempt.
The American of the Northern States is surrounded by no
slaves in his childhood; he is even unattended by free ser-
vants, and is usually obliged to provide for his own wants.
No sooner does he enter the world than the idea of necessity
assails him on every side: he soon learns to know exactly the
natural limit of his authority; he never expects to subdue
those who withstand him, by force; and he knows that the
surest means of obtaining the support of his fellow-creatures,
is to win their favor. He therefore becomes patient, reflect-
ing, tolerant, slow to act, and persevering in his designs.
In the Southern States the more immediate wants of life
are always supplied; the inhabitants of those parts are not
busied in the material cares of life, which are always pro-
vided for by others; and their imagination is diverted to more
captivating and less definite objects. The American of the
South is fond of grandeur, luxury, and renown, of gayety, of
pleasure, and above all of idleness; nothing obliges him to
exert himself in order to subsist; and as he has no necessary
occupations, he gives way to indolence, and does not even

attempt what would be useful.
But the equality of fortunes, and the absence of slavery in
the North, plunge the inhabitants in those same cares of daily
life which are disdained by the white population of the South.
They are taught from infancy to combat want, and to place
comfort above all the pleasures of the intellect or the heart.
The imagination is extinguished by the trivial details of life,
and the ideas become less numerous and less general, but far
more practical and more precise. As prosperity is the sole
aim of exertion, it is excellently well attained; nature and
mankind are turned to the best pecuniary advantage, and
society is dexterously made to contribute to the welfare of
each of its members, whilst individual egotism is the source
of general happiness.
The citizen of the North has not only experience, but
knowledge: nevertheless he sets but little value upon the plea-
sures of knowledge; he esteems it as the means of attaining a
certain end, and he is only anxious to seize its more lucrative
applications. The citizen of the South is more given to act
upon impulse; he is more clever, more frank, more generous,
more intellectual, and more brilliant. The former, with a

greater degree of activity, of common-sense, of information,
and of general aptitude, has the characteristic good and evil
qualities of the middle classes. The latter has the tastes, the
prejudices, the weaknesses, and the magnanimity of all aris-
tocracies. If two men are united in society, who have the
same interests, and to a certain extent the same opinions,
but different characters, different acquirements, and a dif-
ferent style of civilization, it is probable that these men will
not agree. The same remark is applicable to a society of na-
tions. Slavery, then, does not attack the American Union
directly in its interests, but indirectly in its manners.
The States which gave their assent to the federal contract
in 1790 were thirteen in number; the Union now consists of
thirty-four members. The population, which amounted to
nearly 4,000,000 in 1790, had more than tripled in the space
of forty years; and in 1830 it amounted to nearly
13,000,000.* Changes of such magnitude cannot take place
without some danger.
A society of nations, as well as a society of individuals,
derives its principal chances of duration from the wisdom of

*Census of 1790, 3,929,328; 1830, 12,856,165; 1860,
31,443,321; 1870, 38,555,983; 1890, 62,831,900.

its members, their individual weakness, and their limited
number. The Americans who quit the coasts of the Atlantic
Ocean to plunge into the western wilderness, are adventur-
ers impatient of restraint, greedy of wealth, and frequently
men expelled from the States in which they were born. When
they arrive in the deserts they are unknown to each other,
and they have neither traditions, family feeling, nor the force
of example to check their excesses. The empire of the laws is
feeble amongst them; that of morality is still more power-
less. The settlers who are constantly peopling the valley of
the Mississippi are, then, in every respect very inferior to the
Americans who inhabit the older parts of the Union. Never-
theless, they already exercise a great influence in its councils;
and they arrive at the government of the commonwealth
before they have learnt to govern themselves.*

The greater the individual weakness of each of the con-
tracting parties, the greater are the chances of the duration
of the contract; for their safety is then dependent upon their

union. When, in 1790, the most populous of the American
republics did not contain 500,000 inhabitants,* each of them
felt its own insignificance as an independent people, and this
feeling rendered compliance with the federal authority more
easy. But when one of the confederate States reckons, like
the State of New York, 2,000,000 of inhabitants, and covers
an extent of territory equal in surface to a quarter of France,**
it feels its own strength; and although it may continue to
support the Union as advantageous to its prosperity, it no
longer regards that body as necessary to its existence, and as
it continues to belong to the federal compact, it soon aims at
preponderance in the federal assemblies. The probable una-
nimity of the States is diminished as their number increases.
At present the interests of the different parts of the Union
are not at variance; but who is able to foresee the multifari-
ous changes of the future, in a country in which towns are
founded from day to day, and States almost from year to
year?
*Pennsylvania contained 431,373 inhabitants in 1790 [and
5,258,014 in 1890.]
**The area of the State of New York is 49,170 square miles.
[See U. S. census report of 1890.]

*This indeed is only a temporary danger. I have no doubt
that in time society will assume as much stability and regu-
larity in the West as it has already done upon the coast of the
Atlantic Ocean.

Since the first settlement of the British colonies, the num-
ber of inhabitants has about doubled every twenty-two years.
I perceive no causes which are likely to check this progres-
sive increase of the Anglo-American population for the next
hundred years; and before that space of time has elapsed, I
believe that the territories and dependencies of the United
States will be covered by more than 100,000,000 of inhabit-
ants, and divided into forty States.* I admit that these

100,000,000 of men have no ho hostile interests. I suppose,
on the contrary, that they are all equally interested in the
maintenance of the Union; but I am still of opinion that
where there are 100,000,000 of men, and forty distinct na-
tions, unequally strong, the continuance of the Federal Gov-
ernment can only be a fortunate accident.
Whatever faith I may have in the perfectibility of man,
until human nature is altered, and men wholly transformed,
I shall refuse to believe in the duration of a government which
is called upon to hold together forty different peoples, dis-
seminated over a territory equal to one-half of Europe in
extent; to avoid all rivalry, ambition, and struggles between
them, and to direct their independent activity to the accom-
plishment of the same designs.
But the greatest peril to which the Union is exposed by its
increase arises from the continual changes which take place
in the position of its internal strength. The distance from
Lake Superior to the Gulf of Mexico extends from the 47th
to the 30th degree of latitude, a distance of more than 1,200
miles as the bird flies. The frontier of the United States winds
along the whole of this immense line, sometimes falling

*If the population continues to double every twenty-two years, as it has
done for the last two hundred years, the number of inhabitants in the
United States in 1852 will be twenty millions; in 1874, forty-eight mil-
lions; and in 1896, ninety-six millions. This may still be the case even if
the lands on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains should be found
to be unfit for cultivation. The territory which is already occupied can
easily contain this number of inhabitants. One hundred millions of men
disseminated over the surface of the twenty-four States, and the three
dependencies, which constitute the Union, would only give 762 inhab-
itants to the square league; this would be far below the mean population
of France, which is 1,063 to the square league; or of England, which is
1,457; and it would even be below the population of Switzerland, for
that country, notwithstanding its lakes and mountains, contains 783
inhabitants to the square league. See “Malte Brun,” vol. vi. p. 92. [The
actual result has fallen somewhat short of these calculations, in spite of
the vast territorial acquisitions of the United States: but in 1899 the
population is probably about eighty- seven millions, including the popu-
lation of the Philippines, Hawaii, and Porto Rico.]

within its limits, but more frequently extending far beyond
it, into the waste. It has been calculated that the whites ad-
vance every year a mean distance of seventeen miles along
the whole of his vast boundary.* Obstacles, such as an un-
productive district, a lake or an Indian nation unexpectedly
encountered, are sometimes met with. The advancing col-
umn then halts for a while; its two extremities fall back upon
themselves, and as soon as they are reunited they proceed
onwards. This gradual and continuous progress of the Euro-
pean race towards the Rocky Mountains has the solemnity
of a providential event; it is like a deluge of men rising
unabatedly, and daily driven onwards by the hand of God.
Within this first line of conquering settlers towns are built,
and vast States founded. In 1790 there were only a few thou-
sand pioneers sprinkled along the valleys of the Mississippi;
and at the present day these valleys contain as many inhabit-
ants as were to be found in the whole Union in 1790. Their
population amounts to nearly 4,000,000.** The city of Wash-
ington was founded in 1800, in the very centre of the Union;
but such are the changes which have taken place, that it now

stands at one of the extremities; and the delegates of the most
remote Western States are already obliged to perform a jour-
ney as long as that from Vienna to Paris.*

All the States are borne onwards at the same time in the
path of fortune, but of course they do not all increase and
prosper in the same proportion. To the North of the Union
the detached branches of the Alleghany chain, which extend
as far as the Atlantic Ocean, form spacious roads and ports,
which are constantly accessible to vessels of the greatest bur-
den. But from the Potomac to the mouth of the Mississippi
the coast is sandy and flat. In this part of the Union the
mouths of almost all the rivers are obstructed; and the few
harbors which exist amongst these lagoons afford much shal-
lower water to vessels, and much fewer commercial advan-
tages than those of the North.
This first natural cause of inferiority is united to another
cause proceeding from the laws. We have already seen that
slavery, which is abolished in the North, still exists in the
South; and I have pointed out its fatal consequences upon

*See Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, p. 105.
**3,672,317 – Census of 1830.

*The distance from Jefferson, the capital of the State of Mis-
souri, to Washington is 1,019 miles. (“American Almanac,”
1831, p. 48.)

the prosperity of the planter himself.
The North is therefore superior to the South both in com-
merce* and manufacture; the natural consequence of which
is the more rapid increase of population and of wealth within
its borders. The States situate upon the shores of the Atlantic
Ocean are already half-peopled. Most of the land is held by
an owner; and these districts cannot therefore receive so many
emigrants as the Western States, where a boundless field is
still open to their exertions. The valley of the Mississippi is
far more fertile than the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. This
reason, added to all the others, contributes to drive the Eu-
ropeans westward – a fact which may be rigorously demon-
strated by figures. It is found that the sum total of the popu-
lation of all the United States has about tripled in the course
of forty years. But in the recent States adjacent to the Missis-
sippi, the population has increased thirty-one-fold, within
the same space of time.**
*The following statements will suffice to show the differ-
ence which exists between the commerce of the South and
that of the North:—
In 1829 the tonnage of all the merchant vessels belonging
to Virginia, the two Carolinas, and Georgia (the four great
Southern States), amounted to only 5,243 tons. In the same

year the tonnage of the vessels of the State of Massachusetts
alone amounted to 17,322 tons. (See Legislative Documents,
21st Congress, 2d session, No. 140, p. 244.) Thus the State
of Massachusetts had three times as much shipping as the
four above-mentioned States. Nevertheless the area of the
State of Massachusetts is only 7,335 square miles, and its
population amounts to 610,014 inhabitants [2,238,943 in
1890]; whilst the area of the four other States I have quoted
is 210,000 square miles, and their population 3,047,767.
Thus the area of the State of Massachusetts forms only one-
thirtieth part of the area of the four States; and its popula-
tion is five times smaller than theirs. (See “Darby’s View of
the United States.”) Slavery is prejudicial to the commercial
prosperity of the South in several different ways; by dimin-
ishing the spirit of enterprise amongst the whites, and by
preventing them from meeting with as numerous a class of
sailors as they require. Sailors are usually taken from the lowest
ranks of the population. But in the Southern States these
lowest ranks are composed of slaves, and it is very difficult to
employ them at sea. They are unable to serve as well as a
white crew, and apprehensions would always be entertained
of their mutinying in the middle of the ocean, or of their
escaping in the foreign countries at which they might touch.]
**“Darby’s View of the United States,” p. 444.] The relative
position of the central federal power is continually displaced.
Forty years ago the majority of the citizens of the Union was
established upon the coast of the Atlantic, in the environs of

the spot upon which Washington now stands; but the great
body of the people is now advancing inland and to the north,
so that in twenty years the majority will unquestionably be
on the western side of the Alleghanies. If the Union goes on
to subsist, the basin of the Mississippi is evidently marked
out, by its fertility and its extent, as the future centre of the
Federal Government. In thirty or forty years, that tract of
country will have assumed the rank which naturally belongs
to it. It is easy to calculate that its population, compared to
that of the coast of the Atlantic, will be, in round numbers,
as 40 to 11. In a few years the States which founded the
Union will lose the direction of its policy, and the popula-
tion of the valley of the Mississippi will preponderate in the
federal assemblies.

This constant gravitation of the federal power and influ-
ence towards the northwest is shown every ten years, when a
general census of the population is made, and the number of
delegates which each State sends to Congress is settled afresh.*
In 1790 Virginia had nineteen representatives in Congress.
This number continued to increase until the year 1813, when
it reached to twenty-three; from that time it began to decrease,
and in 1833 Virginia elected only twenty-one representatives.**
During the same period the State of New York progressed in
the contrary direction: in 1790 it had ten representatives in
Congress; in 1813, twenty-seven; in 1823, thirty-four; and in
1833, forty. The State of Ohio had only one representative in
1803, and in 1833 it had already nineteen.
*It may be seen that in the course of the last ten years (1820-
1830) the population of one district, as, for instance, the
State of Delaware, has increased in the proportion of five per
cent.; whilst that of another, as the territory of Michigan,
has increased 250 per cent. Thus the population of Virginia
had augmented thirteen per cent., and that of the border
State of Ohio sixty-one per cent., in the same space of time.
The general table of these changes, which is given in the
“National Calendar,” displays a striking picture of the un-
equal fortunes of the different States.
**It has just been said that in the course of the last term the

population of Virginia has increased thirteen per cent.; and
it is necessary to explain how the number of representatives
for a State may decrease, when the population of that State,
far from diminishing, is actually upon the increase. I take
the State of Virginia, to which I have already alluded, as my
term of comparison. The number of representatives of Vir-
ginia in 1823 was proportionate to the total number of the
representatives of the Union, and to the relation which the
population bore to that of the whole Union: in 1833 the
number of representatives of Virginia was likewise propor-
tionate to the total number of the representatives of the
Union, and to the relation which its population, augmented
in the course of ten years, bore to the augmented population
of the Union in the same space of time. The new number of
Virginian representatives will then be to the old numver, on
the one hand, as the new numver of all the representatives is
to the old number; and, on the other hand, as the augmen-
tation of the population of Virginia is to that of the whole
population of the country. Thus, if the increase of the popu-
lation of the lesser country be to that of the greater in an
exact inverse ratio of the proportion between the new and
the old numbers of all the representatives, the number of the
representatives of Virginia will remain stationary; and if the
increase of the Virginian population be to that of the whole
Union in a feeblerratio than the new number of the repre-
sentatives of the Union to the old number, the number of
the representatives of Virginia must decrease. [Thus, to the

56th Congress in 1899, Virginia and West Virginia send only
fourteen representatives.]

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition of Three Races – Part VIII

It is difficult to imagine a durable union of a people which
is rich and strong with one which is poor and weak, even if it
were proved that the strength and wealth of the one are not
the causes of the weakness and poverty of the other. But
union is still more difficult to maintain at a time at which
one party is losing strength, and the other is gaining it. This
rapid and disproportionate increase of certain States threat-
ens the independence of the others. New York might per-
haps succeed, with its 2,000,000 of inhabitants and its forty
representatives, in dictating to the other States in Congress.
But even if the more powerful States make no attempt to
bear down the lesser ones, the danger still exists; for there is
almost as much in the possibility of the act as in the act
itself. The weak generally mistrust the justice and the reason
of the strong. The States which increase less rapidly than the
others look upon those which are more favored by fortune
with envy and suspicion. Hence arise the deep-seated un-
easiness and ill-defined agitation which are observable in the
South, and which form so striking a contrast to the confi-

strances are not listened to, they threaten to quit an associa-
tion which loads them with burdens whilst it deprives them
of their due profits. “The tariff,” said the inhabitants of Caro-
lina in 1832, “enriches the North, and ruins the South; for if
this were not the case, to what can we attribute the continu-
ally increasing power and wealth of the North, with its in-
clement skies and arid soil; whilst the South, which may be
styled the garden of America, is rapidly declining?”*

If the changes which I have described were gradual, so that
each generation at least might have time to disappear with
the order of things under which it had lived, the danger would
be less; but the progress of society in America is precipitate,
and almost revolutionary. The same citizen may have lived
to see his State take the lead in the Union, and afterwards
become powerless in the federal assemblies; and an Anglo-
American republic has been known to grow as rapidly as a
man passing from birth and infancy to maturity in the course
of thirty years. It must not be imagined, however, that the
States which lose their preponderance, also lose their popu-
lation or their riches: no stop is put to their prosperity, and

they even go on to increase more rapidly than any kingdom
in Europe.* But they believe themselves to be impoverished
because their wealth does not augment as rapidly as that of
their neighbors; any they think that their power is lost, be-
cause they suddenly come into collision with a power greater
than their own:** thus they are more hurt in their feelings
and their passions than in their interests. But this is amply
sufficient to endanger the maintenance of the Union. If kings
and peoples had only had their true interests in view ever
since the beginning of the world, the name of war would
scarcely be known among mankind.

*See the report of its committee to the Convention which
proclaimed the nullification of the tariff in South Carolina.

*The population of a country assuredly constitutes the first element
of its wealth. In the ten years (1820-1830) during which Virginia
lost two of its representatives in Congress, its population increased
in the proportion of 13.7 per cent.; that of Carolina in the propor-
tion of fifteen per cent.; and that of Georgia, 15.5 per cent. (See the
“American Almanac,” 1832, p. 162) But the population of Russia,
which increases more rapidly than that of any other European coun-
try, only augments in ten years at the rate of 9.5 per cent.; in France,
at the rate of seven per cent.; and in Europe in general, at the rate of
4.7 per cent. (See “Malte Brun,” vol. vi. p. 95)
**It must be admitted, however, that the depreciation which has
taken place in the value of tobacco, during the last fifty years, has
notably diminished the opulence of the Southern planters: but
this circumstance is as independent of the will of their Northern
brethren as it is of their own.

ment will extend or contract its sphere of action, and whether
it will become more energetic or more weak.

The Americans are evidently disposed to look upon their
future condition with alarm. They perceive that in most of
the nations of the world the exercise of the rights of sover-
eignty tends to fall under the control of a few individuals,
and they are dismayed by the idea that such will also be the
case in their own country. Even the statesmen feel, or affect
to feel, these fears; for, in America, centralization is by no
means popular, and there is no surer means of courting the
majority than by inveighing against the encroachments of
the central power. The Americans do not perceive that the
countries in which this alarming tendency to centralization
exists are inhabited by a single people; whilst the fact of the
Union being composed of different confederate communi-
ties is sufficient to baffle all the inferences which might be
drawn from analogous circumstances. I confess that I am
inclined to consider the fears of a great number of Ameri-
cans as purely imaginary; and far from participating in their
dread of the consolidation of power in the hands of the

Union, I think that the Federal Government is visibly losing
strength.
To prove this assertion I shall not have recourse to any
remote occurrences, but to circumstances which I have my-
self witnessed, and which belong to our own time.
An attentive examination of what is going on in the United
States will easily convince us that two opposite tendencies
exist in that country, like two distinct currents flowing in
contrary directions in the same channel. The Union has now
existed for forty-five years, and in the course of that time a
vast number of provincial prejudices, which were at first
hostile to its power, have died away. The patriotic feeling
which attached each of the Americans to his own native State
is become less exclusive; and the different parts of the Union
have become more intimately connected the better they have
become acquainted with each other. The post,* that great

*In 1832, the district of Michigan, which only contains
31,639 inhabitants, and is still an almost unexplored wilder-
ness, possessed 940 miles of mail-roads. The territory of Ar-
kansas, which is still more uncultivated, was already inter-
sected by 1,938 miles of mail-roads. (See the report of the
General Post Office, November 30, 1833.) The postage of
newspapers alone in the whole Union amounted to $254,796.

instrument of intellectual intercourse, now reaches into the
backwoods; and steamboats have established daily means of
communication between the different points of the coast. An
inland navigation of unexampled rapidity conveys commodi-
ties up and down the rivers of the country.* And to these fa-
cilities of nature and art may be added those restless cravings,
that busy-mindedness, and love of pelf, which are constantly
urging the American into active life, and bringing him into
contact with his fellow-citizens. He crosses the country in ev-
ery direction; he visits all the various populations of the land;
and there is not a province in France in which the natives are
so well known to each other as the 13,000,000 of men who
cover the territory of the United States.
But whilst the Americans intermingle, they grow in re-
semblance of each other; the differences resulting from their
climate, their origin, and their institutions, diminish; and
they all draw nearer and nearer to the common type. Every
year, thousands of men leave the North to settle in different

parts of the Union: they bring with them their faith, their
opinions, and their manners; and as they are more
enlighthned than the men amongst whom they are about to
dwell, they soon rise to the head of affairs, and they adapt
society to their own advantage. This continual emigration of
the North to the South is peculiarly favorable to the fusion
of all the different provincial characters into one national
character. The civilization of the North appears to be the
common standard, to which the whole nation will one day
be assimilated.
The commercial ties which unite the confederate States
are strengthened by the increasing manufactures of the Ameri-
cans; and the union which began to exist in their opinions,
gradually forms a part of their habits: the course of time has
swept away the bugbear thoughts which haunted the imagi-
nations of the citizens in 1789. The federal power is not
become oppressive; it has not destroyed the independence
of the States; it has not subjected the confederates to monar-
chial institutions; and the Union has not rendered the lesser
States dependent upon the larger ones; but the confedera-
tion has continued to increase in population, in wealth, and

*In the course of ten years, from 1821 to 1831, 271 steam-
boats have been launched upon the rivers which water the
valley of the Mississippi alone. In 1829 259 steamboats ex-

140, p. 274.)

in power. I am therefore convinced that the natural obstacles
to the continuance of the American Union are not so power-
ful at the present time as they were in 1789; and that the
enemies of the Union are not so numerous.
Nevertheless, a careful examination of the history of the
United States for the last forty-five years will readily con-
vince us that the federal power is declining; nor is it difficult
to explain the causes of this phenomenon.* When the Con-
stitution of 1789 was promulgated, the nation was a prey to
anarchy; the Union, which succeeded this confusion, excited
much dread and much animosity; but it was warmly sup-
ported because it satisfied an imperious want. Thus, although
it was more attacked than it is now, the federal power soon
reached the maximum of its authority, as is usually the case
with a government which triumphs after having braced its
strength by the struggle. At that time the interpretation of
the Constitution seemed to extend, rather than to repress,
the federal sovereignty; and the Union offered, in several re-
spects, the appearance of a single and undivided people, di-

*[Since 1861 the movement is certainly in the opposite di-
rection, and the federal power has largely increased, and tends
to further increase.]

by the opposition; and it soon acknowledged its error, prom-
ising exactly to confine its influence for the future within
the circle which was prescribed to it.
The Constitution confers upon the Union the right of treat-
ing with foreign nations. The Indian tribes, which border
upon the frontiers of the United States, had usually been
regarded in this light. As long as these savages consented to
retire before the civilized settlers, the federal right was not
contested: but as soon as an Indian tribe attempted to fix its
dwelling upon a given spot, the adjacent States claimed pos-
session of the lands and the rights of sovereignty over the
natives. The central Government soon recognized both these
claims; and after it had concluded treaties with the Indians
as independent nations, it gave them up as subjects to the
legislative tyranny of the States.*

Some of the States which had been founded upon the coast
of the Atlantic, extended indefinitely to the West, into wild
regions where no European had ever penetrated. The States

whose confines were irrevocably fixed, looked with a jealous
eye upon the unbounded regions which the future would
enable their neighbors to explore. The latter then agreed,
with a view to conciliate the others, and to facilitate the act
of union, to lay down their own boundaries, and to abandon
all the territory which lay beyond those limits to the confed-
eration at large.* Thenceforward the Federal Government
became the owner of all the uncultivated lands which lie
beyond the borders of the thirteen States first confederated.
It was invested with the right of parcelling and selling them,
and the sums derived from this source were exclusively re-
served to the public treasure of the Union, in order to fur-
nish supplies for purchasing tracts of country from the Indi-
ans, for opening roads to the remote settlements, and for
accelerating the increase of civilization as much as possible.
New States have, however, been formed in the course of time,
in the midst of those wilds which were formerly ceded by

ing of the Indians, the letter of the President of the United
States to the Cherokees, his correspondence on this subject

in 1780; Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, South and

the inhabitants of the shores of the Atlantic. Congress has
gone on to sell, for the profit of the nation at large, the un-
cultivated lands which those new States contained. But the
latter at length asserted that, as they were now fully consti-
tuted, they ought to enjoy the exclusive right of converting
the produce of these sales to their own use. As their remon-
strances became more and more threatening, Congress
thought fit to deprive the Union of a portion of the privi-
leges which it had hitherto enjoyed; and at the end of 1832
it passed a law by which the greatest part of the revenue
derived from the sale of lands was made over to the new
western republics, although the lands themselves were not
ceded to them.*

The slightest observation in the United States enables one
to appreciate the advantages which the country derives from
the bank. These advantages are of several kinds, but one of
them is peculiarly striking to the stranger. The banknotes of
the United States are taken upon the borders of the desert
for the same value as at Philadelphia, where the bank con-

ducts its operations.*

The Bank of the United States is nevertheless the object of
great animosity. Its directors have proclaimed their hostility
to the President: and they are accused, not without some
show of probability, of having abused their influence to thwart
his election. The President therefore attacks the establish-
ment which they represent with all the warmth of personal
enmity; and he is encouraged in the pursuit of his revenge
by the conviction that he is supported by the secret propen-
sities of the majority. The bank may be regarded as the great
monetary tie of the Union, just as Congress is the great leg-
islative tie; and the same passions which tend to render the
States independent of the central power, contribute to the
overthrow of the bank.
The Bank of the United States always holds a great num-

*It is true that the President refused his assent to this law;
but he completely adopted it in principle. (See Message of
December 8, 1833.)

*The present Bank of the United States was established in
1816, with a capital of $35,000,000; its charter expires in
1836. Last year Congress passed a law to renew it, but the
President put his veto upon the bill. The struggle is still go-
ing on with great violence on either side, and the speedy fall
of the bank may easily be foreseen. [It was soon afterwards
extinguished by General Jackson.]

the bank are identically the same individuals who, on other
points, attack the Federal Government; but I assert that the
attacks directed against the bank of the United States origi-
nate in the same propensities which militate against the Fed-
eral Government; and that the very numerous opponents of
the former afford a deplorable symptom of the decreasing
support of the latter.
The Union has never displayed so much weakness as in
the celebrated question of the tariff.* The wars of the French
Revolution and of 1812 had created manufacturing estab-
lishments in the North of the Union, by cutting off all free
communication between America and Europe. When peace
was concluded, and the channel of intercourse reopened by
which the produce of Europe was transmitted to the New
World, the Americans thought fit to establish a system of
import duties, for the twofold purpose of protecting their
incipient manufactures and of paying off the amount of the
debt contracted during the war. The Southern States, which
have no manufactures to encourage, and which are exclu-
sively agricultural, soon complained of this measure. Such

*See principally for the details of this affair, the Legislative
Documents, 22d Congress, 2d Session, No. 30.

were the simple facts, and I do not pretend to examine in
this place whether their complaints were well founded or
unjust.
As early as the year 1820, South Carolina declared, in a
petition to Congress, that the tariff was “unconstitutional,
oppressive, and unjust.” And the States of Georgia, Virginia,
North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi subsequently re-
monstrated against it with more or less vigor. But Congress,
far from lending an ear to these complaints, raised the scale
of tariff duties in the years 1824 and 1828, and recognized
anew the principle on which it was founded. A doctrine was
then proclaimed, or rather revived, in the South, which took
the name of Nullification.

I have shown in the proper place that the object of the Fed-
eral Constitution was not to form a league, but to create a
national government. The Americans of the United States
form a sole and undivided people, in all the cases which are
specified by that Constitution; and upon these points the
will of the nation is expressed, as it is in all constitutional
nations, by the voice of the majority. When the majority has

pronounced its decision, it is the duty of the minority to
submit. Such is the sound legal doctrine, and the only one
which agrees with the text of the Constitution, and the known
intention of those who framed it.
The partisans of Nullification in the South maintain, on
the contrary, that the intention of the Americans in uniting
was not to reduce themselves to the condition of one and
the same people; that they meant to constitute a league of
independent States; and that each State, consequently re-
tains its entire sovereignty, if not de facto, at least de jure;
and has the right of putting its own construction upon the
laws of Congress, and of suspending their execution within
the limits of its own territory, if they are held to be unconsti-
tutional and unjust.
The entire doctrine of Nullification is comprised in a sen-
tence uttered by Vice-President Calhoun, the head of that
party in the South, before the Senate of the United States, in
the year 1833: could: “The Constitution is a compact to
which the States were parties in their sovereign capacity; now,
whenever a compact is entered into by parties which acknowl-
edge no tribunal above their authority to decide in the last

resort, each of them has a right to judge for itself in relation
to the nature, extent, and obligations of the instrument.” It
is evident that a similar doctrine destroys the very basis of
the Federal Constitution, and brings back all the evils of the
old confederation, from which the Americans were supposed
to have had a safe deliverance.
When South Carolina perceived that Congress turned a
deaf ear to its remonstrances, it threatened to apply the doc-
trine of nullification to the federal tariff bill. Congress per-
sisted in its former system; and at length the storm broke
out. In the course of 1832 the citizens of South Carolina,*
named a national Convention, to consult upon the extraor-
dinary measures which they were called upon to take; and
on November 24th of the same year this Convention pro-
mulgated a law, under the form of a decree, which annulled
the federal law of the tariff, forbade the levy of the imposts
which that law commands, and refused to recognize the ap-

peal which might be made to the federal courts of law.* This
decree was only to be put in execution in the ensuing month
of February, and it was intimated, that if Congress modified
the tariff before that period, South Carolina might be in-
duced to proceed no further with her menaces; and a vague
desire was afterwards expressed of submitting the question
to an extraordinary assembly of all the confederate States.
*This decree was preceded by a report of the committee by which
it was framed, containing the explanation of the motives and ob-
ject of the law. The following passage occurs in it, p. 34: – “When
the rights reserved by the Constitution to the different States are
deliberately violated, it is the duty and the right of those States to
interfere, in order to check the progress of the evil; to resist usur-
pation, and to maintain, within their respective limits, those pow-
ers and privileges which belong to them as independent sovereign
States. If they were destitute of this right, they would not be sov-
ereign. South Carolina declares that she acknowledges no tribunal
upon earth above her authority. She has indeed entered into a
solemn compact of union with the other States; but she demands,
and will exercise, the right of putting her own construction upon
it; and when this compact is violated by her sister States, and by
the Government which they have created, she is determined to
avail herself of the unquestionable right of judging what is the
extent of the infraction, and what are the measures best fitted to
obtain justice.”

*That is to say, the majority of the people; for the opposite
party, called the Union party, always formed a very strong
and active minority. Carolina may contain about 47,000 elec-
tors; 30,000 were in favor of nullification, and 17,000 op-
posed to it.

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races – Part IX

In the meantime South Carolina armed her militia, and pre-
pared for war. But Congress, which had slighted its suppli-
ant subjects, listened to their complaints as soon as they were
found to have taken up arms.* A law was passed, by which
the tariff duties were to be progressively reduced for ten years,
until they were brought so low as not to exceed the amount
of supplies necessary to the Government.** Thus Congress
completely abandoned the principle of the tariff; and substi-
tuted a mere fiscal impost to a system of protective duties.***
The Government of the Union, in order to conceal its de-
feat, had recourse to an expedient which is very much in
vogue with feeble governments. It yielded the point de facto,
but it remained inflexible upon the principles in question;
and whilst Congress was altering the tariff law, it passed an-
other bill, by which the President was invested with extraor-
dinary powers, enabling him to overcome by force a resis-
tance which was then no longer to be apprehended.
*Congress was finally decided to take this step by the conduct of
the powerful State of Virginia, whose legislature offered to serve as
mediator between the Union and South Carolina. Hitherto the
latter State had appeared to be entirely abandoned, even by the
States which had joined in her remonstrances.
**This law was passed on March 2, 1833.
***This bill was brought in by Mr. Clay, and it passed in four days
through both Houses of Congress by an immense majority.

reaction will take place with a view to increase its strength.
The Government of the United States is, of all the federal
governments which have hitherto been established, the one
which is most naturally destined to act. As long as it is only
indirectly assailed by the interpretation of its laws, and as long
as its substance is not seriously altered, a change of opinion,
an internal crisis, or a war, may restore all the vigor which it
requires. The point which I have been most anxious to put in
a clear light is simply this: Many people, especially in France,
imagine that a change in opinion is going on in the United
States, which is favorable to a centralization of power in the
hands of the President and the Congress. I hold that a con-
trary tendency may distinctly be observed. So far is the Fed-
eral Government from acquiring strength, and from threaten-
ing the sovereignty of the States, as it grows older, that I main-
tain it to be growing weaker and weaker, and that the sover-
eignty of the Union alone is in danger. Such are the facts which
the present time discloses. The future conceals the final result
of this tendency, and the events which may check, retard, or
accelerate the changes I have described; but I do not affect to
be able to remove the veil which hides them from our sight.

Of the Republican Institutions of The United States, and
What Their Chances of Duration Are

The Union is accidental – The Republican institutions have
more prospect of permanence – A republic for the present the
natural state of the Anglo-Americans – Reason of this – In
order to destroy it, all the laws must be changed at the same
time, and a great alteration take place in manners – Difficul-
ties experienced by the Americans in creating an aristocracy.

The dismemberment of the Union, by the introduction of
war into the heart of those States which are now confeder-
ate, with standing armies, a dictatorship, and a heavy taxa-
tion, might, eventually, compromise the fate of the republi-
can institutions. But we ought not to confound the future
prospects of the republic with those of the Union. The Union
is an accident, which will only last as long as circumstances
are favorable to its existence; but a republican form of gov-
ernment seems to me to be the natural state of the Ameri-
cans; which nothing but the continued action of hostile
causes, always acting in the same direction, could change

into a monarchy. The Union exists principally in the law
which formed it; one revolution, one change in public opin-
ion, might destroy it forever; but the republic has a much
deeper foundation to rest upon.

What is understood by a republican government in the
United States is the slow and quiet action of society upon
itself. It is a regular state of things really founded upon the
enlightened will of the people. It is a conciliatory govern-
ment under which resolutions are allowed time to ripen; and
in which they are deliberately discussed, and executed with
mature judgment. The republicans in the United States set a
high value upon morality, respect religious belief, and ac-
knowledge the existence of rights. They profess to think that
a people ought to be moral,religious, and temperate, in pro-
portion as it is free. What is called the republic in the United
States, is the tranquil rule of the majority, which, after hav-
ing had time to examine itself, and to give proof of its exist-
ence, is the common source of all the powers of the State.
But the power of the majority is not of itself unlimited. In
the moral world humanity, justice, and reason enjoy an un-

they are formerly recognized by the legislation: and before
this legislation can be altered the whole community must
undergo very serious changes. In the United States, even the
religion of most of the citizens is republican, since it submits
the truths of the other world to private judgment: as in poli-
tics the care of its temporal interests is abandoned to the
good sense of the people. Thus every man is allowed freely
to take that road which he thinks will lead him to heaven;
just as the law permits every citizen to have the right of choos-
ing his government.
It is evident that nothing but a long series of events, all
having the same tendency, can substitute for this combina-
tion of laws, opinions, and manners, a mass of opposite opin-
ions, manners, and laws.
If republican principles are to perish in America, they can
only yield after a laborious social process, often interrupted,
and as often resumed; they will have many apparent revivals,
and will not become totally extinct until an entirely new
people shall have succeeded to that which now exists. Now,
it must be admitted that there is no symptom or presage of
the approach of such a revolution. There is nothing more

striking to a person newly arrived in the United States, than
the kind of tumultuous agitation in which he finds politi-
cal society. The laws are incessantly changing, and at first
sight it seems impossible that a people so variable in its
desires should avoid adopting, within a short space of time,
a completely new form of government. Such apprehensions
are, however, premature; the instability which affects po-
litical institutions is of two kinds, which ought not to be
confounded: the first, which modifies secondary laws, is
not incompatible with a very settled state of society; the
other shakes the very foundations of the Constitution, and
attacks the fundamental principles of legislation; this spe-
cies of instability is always followed by troubles and revo-
lutions, and the nation which suffers under it is in a state
of violent transition.
Experience shows that these two kinds of legislative insta-
bility have no necessary connection; for they have been found
united or separate, according to times and circumstances.
The first is common in the United States, but not the sec-
ond: the Americans often change their laws, but the founda-
tion of the Constitution is respected.

In our days the republican principle rules in America, as
the monarchical principle did in France under Louis XIV.
The French of that period were not only friends of the mon-
archy, but they thought it impossible to put anything in its
place; they received it as we receive the rays of the sun and
the return of the seasons. Amongst them the royal power
had neither advocates nor opponents. In like manner does
the republican government exist in America, without con-
tention or opposition; without proofs and arguments, by a
tacit agreement, a sort of consensus universalis. It is, how-
ever, my opinion that by changing their administrative forms
as often as they do, the inhabitants of the United States com-
promise the future stability of their government.
It may be apprehended that men, perpetually thwarted
in their designs by the mutability of the legislation, will
learn to look upon republican institutions as an inconve-
nient form of society; the evil resulting from the instability
of the secondary enactments might then raise a doubt as to
the nature of the fundamental principles of the Constitu-
tion, and indirectly bring about a revolution; but this ep-
och is still very remote.

It may, however, be foreseen even now, that when the
Americans lose their republican institutions they will speed-
ily arrive at a despotic government, without a long interval
of limited monarchy. Montesquieu remarked, that nothing
is more absolute than the authority of a prince who immedi-
ately succeeds a republic, since the powers which had fear-
lessly been intrusted to an elected magistrate are then trans-
ferred to a hereditary sovereign. This is true in general, but it
is more peculiarly applicable to a democratic republic. In the
United States, the magistrates are not elected by a particular
class of citizens, but by the majority of the nation; they are
the immediate representatives of the passions of the multi-
tude; and as they are wholly dependent upon its pleasure,
they excite neither hatred nor fear: hence, as I have already
shown, very little care has been taken to limit their influ-
ence, and they are left in possession of a vast deal of arbitrary
power. This state of things has engendered habits which
would outlive itself; the American magistrate would retain
his power, but he would cease to be responsible for the exer-
cise of it; and it is impossible to say what bounds could then
be set to tyranny.

Some of our European politicians expect to see an aristoc-
racy arise in America, and they already predict the exact pe-
riod at which it will be able to assume the reins of govern-
ment. I have previously observed, and I repeat my assertion,
that the present tendency of American society appears to me
to become more and more democratic. Nevertheless, I do
not assert that the Americans will not, at some future time,
restrict the circle of political rights in their country, or con-
fiscate those rights to the advantage of a single individual;
but I cannot imagine that they will ever bestow the exclusive
exercise of them upon a privileged class of citizens, or, in
other words, that they will ever found an aristocracy.
An aristocratic body is composed of a certain number of
citizens who, without being very far removed from the mass
of the people, are, nevertheless, permanently stationed above
it: a body which it is easy to touch and difficult to strike;
with which the people are in daily contact, but with which
they can never combine. Nothing can be imagined more
contrary to nature and to the secret propensities of the hu-
man heart than a subjection of this kind; and men who are
left to follow their own bent will always prefer the arbitrary

should gradually establish an inequality of conditions, until
it arrived at inviolable privileges and exclusive castes, would
be a novelty in the world; and nothing intimates that America
is likely to furnish so singular an example.

Reflection on the Causes of the Commercial Prosperity
of The United States

The Americans destined by Nature to be a great maritime
people – Extent of their coasts – Depth of their ports – Size
of their rivers – The commercial superiority of the Anglo-
Americans less attributable, however, to physical circum-
stances than to moral and intellectual causes – Reason of
this opinion – Future destiny of the Anglo-Americans as a
commercial nation – The dissolution of the Union would
not check the maritime vigor of the States – Reason of this –
Anglo-Americans will naturally supply the wants of the in-
habitants of South America – They will become, like the
English, the factors of a great portion of the world.

The coast of the United States, from the Bay of Fundy to the

Sabine River in the Gulf of Mexico, is more than two thou-
sand miles in extent. These shores form an unbroken line,
and they are all subject to the same government. No nation
in the world possesses vaster, deeper, or more secure ports
for shipping than the Americans.
The inhabitants of the United States constitute a great civi-
lized people, which fortune has placed in the midst of an
uncultivated country at a distance of three thousand miles
from the central point of civilization. America consequently
stands in daily need of European trade. The Americans will,
no doubt, ultimately succeed in producing or manufactur-
ing at home most of the articles which they require; but the
two continents can never be independent of each other, so
numerous are the natural ties which exist between their wants,
their ideas, their habits, and their manners.
The Union produces peculiar commodities which are now
become necessary to us, but which cannot be cultivated, or
can only be raised at an enormous expense, upon the soil of
Europe. The Americans only consume a small portion of
this produce, and they are willing to sell us the rest. Europe
is therefore the market of America, as America is the market

of Europe; and maritime commerce is no less necessary to
enable the inhabitants of the United States to transport their
raw materials to the ports of Europe, than it is to enable us
to supply them with our manufactured produce. The United
States were therefore necessarily reduced to the alternative of
increasing the business of other maritime nations to a great
extent, if they had themselves declined to enter into com-
merce, as the Spaniards of Mexico have hitherto done; or, in
the second place, of becoming one of the first trading pow-
ers of the globe.
The Anglo-Americans have always displayed a very decided
taste for the sea. The Declaration of Independence broke the
commercial restrictions which united them to England, and
gave a fresh and powerful stimulus to their maritime genius.
Ever since that time, the shipping of the Union has increased
in almost the same rapid proportion as the number of its
inhabitants. The Americans themselves now transport to their
own shores nine-tenths of the European produce which they
consume.* And they also bring three- quarters of the exports
of the New World to the European consumer.** The ships

of the United States fill the docks of Havre and of Liverpool;
whilst the number of English and French vessels which are
to be seen at New York is comparatively small.***
*The total value of goods imported during the year which ended
on September 30, 1832, was $101,129,266. The value of the car-
goes of foreign vessels did not amount to $10,731,039, or about
one-tenth of the entire sum.
**The value of goods exported during the same year amounted to
$87,176,943; the value of goods exported by foreign vessels
amounted to $21,036,183, or about one quarter of the whole
sum. (Williams’s “Register,” 1833, p. 398.)
***The tonnage of the vessels which entered all the ports of the
Union in the years 1829, 1830, and 1831, amounted to 3,307,719
tons, of which 544,571 tons were foreign vessels; they stood, there-
fore, to the American vessels in a ratio of about 16 to 100. (“Na-
tional Calendar,” 1833, p. 304.) The tonnage of the English ves-
sels which entered the ports of London, Liverpool, and Hull, in
the years 1820, 1826, and 1831, amounted to 443,800 tons. The
foreign vessels which entered the same ports during the same years
amounted to 159,431 tons. The ratio between them was, there-
fore, about 36 to 100. (“Companion to the Almanac,” 1834, p.
169.) In the year 1832 the ratio between the foreign and British
ships which entered the ports of Great Britain was 29 to 100.
[These statements relate to a condition of affairs which has ceased
to exist; the Civil War and the heavy taxation of the United States
entirely altered the trade and navigation of the country.]

Thus, not only does the American merchant face the com-
petition of his own countrymen, but he even supports that of
foreign nations in their own ports with success. This is readily
explained by the fact that the vessels of the United States can
cross the seas at a cheaper rate than any other vessels in the
world. As long as the mercantile shipping of the United States
preserves this superiority, it will not only retain what it has
acquired, but it will constantly increase in prosperity.

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races – Part X

It is difficult to say for what reason the Americans can trade
at a lower rate than other nations; and one is at first led to
attribute this circumstance to the physical or natural advan-
tages which are within their reach; but this supposition is
erroneous. The American vessels cost almost as much to build
as our own;* they are not better built, and they generally last
for a shorter time. The pay of the American sailor is more
considerable than the pay on board European ships; which
is proved by the great number of Europeans who are to be

dices of their present station; they are not more attached to
one line of operation than to another; they are not more
prone to employ an old method than a new one; they have
no rooted habits, and they easily shake off the influence which
the habits of other nations might exercise upon their minds
from a conviction that their country is unlike any other, and
that its situation is without a precedent in the world. America
is a land of wonders, in which everything is in constant mo-
tion, and every movement seems an improvement. The idea
of novelty is there indissolubly connected with the idea of
amelioration. No natural boundary seems to be set to the
efforts of man; and what is not yet done is only what he has
not yet attempted to do.
This perpetual change which goes on in the United States,
these frequent vicissitudes of fortune, accompanied by such
unforeseen fluctuations in private and in public wealth, serve
to keep the minds of the citizens in a perpetual state of fever-
ish agitation, which admirably invigorates their exertions,
and keeps them in a state of excitement above the ordinary
level of mankind. The whole life of an American is passed
like a game of chance, a revolutionary crisis, or a battle. As
the same causes are continually in operation throughout the
country, they ultimately impart an irresistible impulse to the
national character. The American, taken as a chance speci-
men of his countrymen, must then be a man of singular
warmth in his desires, enterprising, fond of adventure, and,

above all, of innovation. The same bent is manifest in all
that he does; he introduces it into his political laws, his reli-
gious doctrines, his theories of social economy, and his do-
mestic occupations; he bears it with him in the depths of the
backwoods, as well as in the business of the city. It is this
same passion, applied to maritime commerce, which makes
him the cheapest and the quickest trader in the world.
As long as the sailors of the United States retain these
inspiriting advantages, and the practical superiority which
they derive from them, they will not only continue to sup-
ply the wants of the producers and consumers of their own
country, but they will tend more and more to become, like
the English, the factors of all other peoples.* This prediction
has already begun to be realized; we perceive that the Ameri-
can traders are introducing themselves as intermediate agents
in the commerce of several European nations;** and America
will offer a still wider field to their enterprise.
*It must not be supposed that English vessels are exclusively em-
ployed in transporting foreign produce into England, or British
produce to foreign countries; at the present day the merchant ship-
ping of England may be regarded in the light of a vast system of
public conveyances, ready to serve all the producers of the world,
and to open communications between all peoples. The maritime
genius of the Americans prompts them to enter into competition
with the English.
**Part of the commerce of the Mediterranean is already carried on
by American vessels.

The great colonies which were founded in South America
by the Spaniards and the Portuguese have since become em-
pires. Civil war and oppression now lay waste those exten-
sive regions. Population does not increase, and the thinly
scattered inhabitants are too much absorbed in the cares of
self-defense even to attempt any amelioration of their condi-
tion. Such, however, will not always be the case. Europe has
succeeded by her own efforts in piercing the gloom of the
Middle Ages; South America has the same Christian laws
and Christian manners as we have; she contains all the germs
of civilization which have grown amidst the nations of Eu-
rope or their offsets, added to the advantages to be derived
from our example: why then should she always remain un-
civilized? It is clear that the question is simply one of time; at
some future period, which may be more or less remote, the
inhabitants of South America will constitute flourishing and
enlightened nations.
But when the Spaniards and Portuguese of South America
begin to feel the wants common to all civilized nations, they
will still be unable to satisfy those wants for themselves; as
the youngest children of civilization, they must perforce ad-

and the States of which that body is composed are the mod-
els which the other communities try to imitate to the best of
their power; it is from the United States that they borrow
their political principles and their laws.
The Americans of the United States stand in precisely the
same position with regard to the peoples of South America
as their fathers, the English, occupy with regard to the Ital-
ians, the Spaniards, the Portuguese, and all those nations of
Europe which receive their articles of daily consumption from
England, because they are less advanced in civilization and
trade. England is at this time the natural emporium of al-
most all the nations which are within its reach; the Ameri-
can Union will perform the same part in the other hemi-
sphere; and every community which is founded, or which
prospers in the New World, is founded and prospers to the
advantage of the Anglo-Americans.
If the Union were to be dissolved, the commerce of the
States which now compose it would undoubtedly be checked
for a time; but this consequence would be less perceptible
than is generally supposed. It is evident that, whatever may
happen, the commercial States will remain united. They are

Nations, as well as men, almost always betray the most
prominent features of their future destiny in their earliest
years. When I contemplate the ardor with which the Anglo-
Americans prosecute commercial enterprise, the advantages
which befriend them, and the success of their undertakings,
I cannot refrain from believing that they will one day be-
come the first maritime power of the globe. They are born to
rule the seas, as the Romans were to conquer the world.

Conclusion

I have now nearly reached the close of my inquiry; hitherto,
in speaking of the future destiny of the United States, I have
endeavored to divide my subject into distinct portions, in
order to study each of them with more attention. My present
object is to embrace the whole from one single point; the
remarks I shall make will be less detailed, but they will be
more sure. I shall perceive each object less distinctly, but I
shall descry the principal facts with more certainty. A travel-
ler who has just left the walls of an immense city, climbs the
neighboring hill; as he goes father off he loses sight of the

tween the mouth of the St. Lawrence and the delta of the
Mississippi were unaccustomed to any other tongue but ours;
and all the European settlements scattered over that immense
region recalled the traditions of our country. Louisbourg,
Montmorency, Duquesne, St. Louis, Vincennes, New Or-
leans (for such were the names they bore) are words dear to
France and familiar to our ears.

But a concourse of circumstances, which it would be tedious
to enumerate,* have deprived us of this magnificent inherit-
ance. Wherever the French settlers were numerically weak
and partially established, they have disappeared: those who
remain are collected on a small extent of country, and are
now subject to other laws. The 400,000 French inhabitants
of Lower Canada constitute, at the present time, the rem-
nant of an old nation lost in the midst of a new people. A

* The foremost of these circumstances is, that nations which
are accustomed to free institutions and municipal govern-
ment are better able than any others to found prosperous
colonies. The habit of thinking and governing for oneself is
indispensable in a new country, where success necessarily
depends, in a great measure, upon the individual exertions
of the settlers.

foreign population is increasing around them unceasingly
and on all sides, which already penetrates amongst the an-
cient masters of the country, predominates in their cities and
corrupts their language. This population is identical with
that of the United States; it is therefore with truth that I
asserted that the British race is not confined within the fron-
tiers of the Union, since it already extends to the northeast.
To the northwest nothing is to be met with but a few insig-
nificant Russian settlements; but to the southwest, Mexico
presents a barrier to the Anglo-Americans. Thus, the Span-
iards and the Anglo-Americans are, properly speaking, the only
two races which divide the possession of the New World. The
limits of separation between them have been settled by a treaty;
but although the conditions of that treaty are exceedingly fa-
vorable to the Anglo-Americans, I do not doubt that they will
shortly infringe this arrangement. Vast provinces, extending
beyond the frontiers of the Union towards Mexico, are still
destitute of inhabitants. The natives of the United States will
forestall the rightful occupants of these solitary regions. They
will take possession of the soil, and establish social institu-
tions, so that when the legal owner arrives at length, he will

find the wilderness under cultivation, and strangers quietly
settled in the midst of his inheritance.*

The lands of the New World belong to the first occupant,
and they are the natural reward of the swiftest pioneer. Even
the countries which are already peopled will have some diffi-
culty in securing themselves from this invasion. I have al-
ready alluded to what is taking place in the province of Texas.
The inhabitants of the United States are perpetually migrat-
ing to Texas, where they purchase land; and although they
conform to the laws of the country, they are gradually found-
ing the empire of their own language and their own man-
ners. The province of Texas is still part of the Mexican do-
minions, but it will soon contain no Mexicans; the same
thing has occurred whenever the Anglo-Americans have come
into contact with populations of a different origin.
It cannot be denied that the British race has acquired an
amazing preponderance over all the other European races in
the New World; and that it is very superior to them in civi-
lization, in industry, and in power. As long as it is only sur-

*[This was speedily accomplished, and ere long both Texas
and California formed part of the United States. The Rus-
sian settlements were acquired by purchase.]

and the tropics, extending from the coasts of the Atlantic to the
shores of the Pacific Ocean. The territory which will probably
be occupied by the Anglo-Americans at some future time, may
be computed to equal three-quarters of Europe in extent.* The
climate of the Union is upon the whole preferable to that of
Europe, and its natural advantages are not less great; it is there-
fore evident that its population will at some future time be pro-
portionate to our own. Europe, divided as it is between so many
different nations, and torn as it has been by incessant wars and
the barbarous manners of the Middle Ages, has notwithstand-
ing attained a population of 410 inhabitants to the square
league.** What cause can prevent the United States from hav-
ing as numerous a population in time?
* The United States already extend over a territory equal to
one-half of Europe. The area of Europe is 500,000 square
leagues, and its population 205,000,000 of inhabitants.
(“Malte Brun,” liv. 114. vol. vi. p. 4.)
[This computation is given in French leagues, which were
in use when the author wrote. Twenty years later, in 1850,
the superficial area of the United States had been extended
to 3,306,865 square miles of territory, which is about the
area of Europe.]
**See “Malte Brun,” liv. 116, vol. vi. p. 92.

Many ages must elapse before the divers offsets of the Brit-
ish race in America cease to present the same homogeneous
characteristics: and the time cannot be foreseen at which a
permanent inequality of conditions will be established in the
New World. Whatever differences may arise, from peace or
from war, from freedom or oppression, from prosperity or
want, between the destinies of the different descendants of
the great Anglo-American family, they will at least preserve
an analogous social condition, and they will hold in com-
mon the customs and the opinions to which that social con-
dition has given birth.
In the Middle Ages, the tie of religion was sufficiently pow-
erful to imbue all the different populations of Europe with
the same civilization. The British of the New World have a
thousand other reciprocal ties; and they live at a time when
the tendency to equality is general amongst mankind. The
Middle Ages were a period when everything was broken up;
when each people, each province, each city, and each family,
had a strong tendency to maintain its distinct individuality.
At the present time an opposite tendency seems to prevail,
and the nations seem to be advancing to unity. Our means

of intellectual intercourse unite the most remote parts of the
earth; and it is impossible for men to remain strangers to
each other, or to be ignorant of the events which are taking
place in any corner of the globe. The consequence is that
there is less difference, at the present day, between the Euro-
peans and their descendants in the New World, than there
was between certain towns in the thirteenth century which
were only separated by a river. If this tendency to assimila-
tion brings foreign nations closer to each other, it must a
fortiori prevent the descendants of the same people from
becoming aliens to each other.
The time will therefore come when one hundred and fifty
millions of men will be living in North America,* equal in
condition, the progeny of one race, owing their origin to the
same cause, and preserving the same civilization, the same lan-
guage, the same religion, the same habits, the same manners,
and imbued with the same opinions, propagated under the
same forms. The rest is uncertain, but this is certain; and it is
a fact new to the world – a fact fraught with such portentous
consequences as to baffle the efforts even of the imagination.
*This would be a population proportionate to that of Europe,
taken at a mean rate of 410 inhabitants to the square league.

There are, at the present time, two great nations in the
world which seem to tend towards the same end, although
they started from different points: I allude to the Russians
and the Americans. Both of them have grown up unnoticed;
and whilst the attention of mankind was directed elsewhere,
they have suddenly assumed a most prominent place amongst
the nations; and the world learned their existence and their
greatness at almost the same time.
All other nations seem to have nearly reached their natural
limits, and only to be charged with the maintenance of their
power; but these are still in the act of growth;* all the others
are stopped, or continue to advance with extreme difficulty;
these are proceeding with ease and with celerity along a path
to which the human eye can assign no term. The American
struggles against the natural obstacles which oppose him;
the adversaries of the Russian are men; the former combats
the wilderness and savage life; the latter, civilization with all
its weapons and its arts: the conquests of the one are there-
fore gained by the ploughshare; those of the other by the
sword. The Anglo-American relies upon personal interest to

accomplish his ends, and gives free scope to the unguided
exertions and common-sense of the citizens; the Russian cen-
tres all the authority of society in a single arm: the principal
instrument of the former is freedom; of the latter servitude.
Their starting-point is different, and their courses are not
the same; yet each of them seems to be marked out by the
will of Heaven to sway the destinies of half the globe.

Democracy In
America

Alexis de Toqueville

Book Two

Influence of Democracy on Progress of Opinion
in US

De Tocqueville’s Preface To The Second Part

The Americans live in a democratic state of society, which
has naturally suggested to them certain laws and a certain
political character. This same state of society has, moreover,
engendered amongst them a multitude of feelings and opin-
ions which were unknown amongst the elder aristocratic
communities of Europe: it has destroyed or modified all the
relations which before existed, and established others of a novel
kind. The aspect of civil society has been no less affected by
these changes than that of the political world. The former sub-
ject has been treated of in the work on the Democracy of
America, which I published five years ago; to examine the lat-
ter is the object of the present book; but these two parts com-
plete each other, and form one and the same work.
I must at once warn the reader against an error which would
be extremely prejudicial to me. When he finds that I attribute
so many different consequences to the principle of equality,

between which we are divided, I have endeavored to sup-
press within me for a time the favorable sympathies or the
adverse emotions with which each of them inspires me. If
those who read this book can find a single sentence intended
to flatter any of the great parties which have agitated my
country, or any of those petty factions which now harass and
weaken it, let such readers raise their voices to accuse me.
The subject I have sought to embrace is immense, for it
includes the greater part of the feelings and opinions to which
the new state of society has given birth. Such a subject is
doubtless above my strength, and in treating it I have not
succeeded in satisfying myself. But, if I have not been able to
reach the goal which I had in view, my readers will at least
do me the justice to acknowledge that I have conceived and
followed up my undertaking in a spirit not unworthy of suc-
cess.

Chapter I: Philosophical Method Among the
Americans

I think that in no country in the civilized world is less atten-
tion paid to philosophy than in the United States. The Ameri-
cans have no philosophical school of their own; and they
care but little for all the schools into which Europe is di-
vided, the very names of which are scarcely known to them.
Nevertheless it is easy to perceive that almost all the inhabit-
ants of the United States conduct their understanding in the
same manner, and govern it by the same rules; that is to say,
that without ever having taken the trouble to define the rules
of a philosophical method, they are in possession of one,
common to the whole people. To evade the bondage of sys-
tem and habit, of family maxims, class opinions, and, in some
degree, of national prejudices; to accept tradition only as a
means of information, and existing facts only as a lesson used
in doing otherwise, and doing better; to seek the reason of
things for one’s self, and in one’s self alone; to tend to results
without being bound to means, and to aim at the substance
through the form; – such are the principal characteristics of

ral. As it is on their own testimony that they are accustomed
to rely, they like to discern the object which engages their
attention with extreme clearness; they therefore strip off as
much as possible all that covers it, they rid themselves of
whatever separates them from it, they remove whatever con-
ceals it from sight, in order to view it more closely and in the
broad light of day. This disposition of the mind soon leads
them to contemn forms, which they regard as useless and
inconvenient veils placed between them and the truth.
The Americans then have not required to extract their
philosophical method from books; they have found it in
themselves. The same thing may be remarked in what has
taken place in Europe. This same method has only been es-
tablished and made popular in Europe in proportion as the
condition of society has become more equal, and men have
grown more like each other. Let us consider for a moment
the connection of the periods in which this change may be
traced. In the sixteenth century the Reformers subjected some
of the dogmas of the ancient faith to the scrutiny of private
judgment; but they still withheld from it the judgment of all
the rest. In the seventeenth century, Bacon in the natural

etrate into society and become the common standard of in-
telligence; and that, after it had become popular among the
French, it has been ostensibly adopted or secretly followed
by all the nations of Europe?
The philosophical method here designated may have been
engendered in the sixteenth century - it may have been
more accurately defined and more extensively applied in
the seventeenth; but neither in the one nor in the other
could it be commonly adopted. Political laws, the condi-
tion of society, and the habits of mind which are derived
from these causes, were as yet opposed to it. It was discov-
ered at a time when men were beginning to equalize and
assimilate their conditions. It could only be generally fol-
lowed in ages when those conditions had at length become
nearly equal, and men nearly alike.
The philosophical method of the eighteenth century is then
not only French, but it is democratic; and this explains why
it was so readily admitted throughout Europe, where it has
contributed so powerfully to change the face of society. It is
not because the French have changed their former opinions,
and altered their former manners, that they have convulsed

the world; but because they were the first to generalize and
bring to light a philosophical method, by the assistance of
which it became easy to attack all that was old, and to open
a path to all that was new.
If it be asked why, at the present day, this same method is
more rigorously followed and more frequently applied by
the French than by the Americans, although the principle of
equality be no less complete, and of more ancient date,
amongst the latter people, the fact may be attributed to two
circumstances, which it is essential to have clearly under-
stood in the first instance. It must never be forgotten that
religion gave birth to Anglo-American society. In the United
States religion is therefore commingled with all the habits of
the nation and all the feelings of patriotism; whence it de-
rives a peculiar force. To this powerful reason another of no
less intensity may be added: in American religion has, as it
were, laid down its own limits. Religious institutions have
remained wholly distinct from political institutions, so that
former laws have been easily changed whilst former belief
has remained unshaken. Christianity has therefore retained
a strong hold on the public mind in America; and, I would

That sort of intellectual freedom which equality may give
ought, therefore, to be very carefully distinguished from the
anarchy which revolution brings. Each of these two things
must be severally considered, in order not to conceive exag-
gerated hopes or fears of the future.
I believe that the men who will live under the new forms
of society will make frequent use of their private judgment;
but I am far from thinking that they will often abuse it. This
is attributable to a cause of more general application to all
democratic countries, and which, in the long run, must needs
restrain in them the independence of individual speculation
within fixed, and sometimes narrow, limits. I shall proceed
to point out this cause in the next chapter.

Chapter II: Of the Principal Source of Belief
Among Democratic Nations

At different periods dogmatical belief is more or less abun-
dant. It arises in different ways, and it may change its object
or its form; but under no circumstances will dogmatical be-
lief cease to exist, or, in other words, men will never cease to

entertain some implicit opinions without trying them by
actual discussion. If everyone undertook to form his own
opinions and to seek for truth by isolated paths struck out
by himself alone, it is not to be supposed that any consider-
able number of men would ever unite in any common be-
lief. But obviously without such common belief no society
can prosper - say rather no society can subsist; for without
ideas held in common, there is no common action, and with-
out common action, there may still be men, but there is no
social body. In order that society should exist, and, a fortiori,
that a society should prosper, it is required that all the minds
of the citizens should be rallied and held together by certain
predominant ideas; and this cannot be the case, unless each
of them sometimes draws his opinions from the common
source, and consents to accept certain matters of belief at the
hands of the community.
If I now consider man in his isolated capacity, I find that
dogmatical belief is not less indispensable to him in order to
live alone, than it is to enable him to co-operate with his
fellow- creatures. If man were forced to demonstrate to him-
self all the truths of which he makes daily use, his task would

his choice from amongst the various objects of human be-
lief, and he must adopt many opinions without discussion,
in order to search the better into that smaller number which
he sets apart for investigation. It is true that whoever receives
an opinion on the word of another, does so far enslave his
mind; but it is a salutary servitude which allows him to make
a good use of freedom.
A principle of authority must then always occur, under all
circumstances, in some part or other of the moral and intel-
lectual world. Its place is variable, but a place it necessarily
has. The independence of individual minds may be greater,
or it may be less: unbounded it cannot be. Thus the ques-
tion is, not to know whether any intellectual authority exists
in the ages of democracy, but simply where it resides and by
what standard it is to be measured.
I have shown in the preceding chapter how the equality of
conditions leads men to entertain a sort of instinctive incre-
dulity of the supernatural, and a very lofty and often exag-
gerated opinion of the human understanding. The men who
live at a period of social equality are not therefore easily led
to place that intellectual authority to which they bow either

from thinking at all. And I perceive how, under the domin-
ion of certain laws, democracy would extinguish that liberty
of the mind to which a democratic social condition is favor-
able; so that, after having broken all the bondage once im-
posed on it by ranks or by men, the human mind would be
closely fettered to the general will of the greatest number.
If the absolute power of the majority were to be substituted
by democratic nations, for all the different powers which
checked or retarded overmuch the energy of individual minds,
the evil would only have changed its symptoms. Men would
not have found the means of independent life; they would
simply have invented (no easy task) a new dress for servitude.
There is - and I cannot repeat it too often - there is in this
matter for profound reflection for those who look on freedom
as a holy thing, and who hate not only the despot, but despo-
tism. For myself, when I feel the hand of power lie heavy on
my brow, I care but little to know who oppresses me; and I am
not the more disposed to pass beneath the yoke, because it is
held out to me by the arms of a million of men.

Book One – Chapters III – V

Chapter III: Why The Americans Display More Readi-
ness And More Taste For General Ideas Than Their
Forefathers, The English

The Deity does not regard the human race collectively. He
surveys at one glance and severally all the beings of whom
mankind is composed, and he discerns in each man the re-
semblances which assimilate him to all his fellows, and the
differences which distinguish him from them. God, there-
fore, stands in no need of general ideas; that is to say, he is
never sensible of the necessity of collecting a considerable
number of analogous objects under the same form for greater
convenience in thinking. Such is, however, not the case with
man. If the human mind were to attempt to examine and
pass a judgment on all the individual cases before it, the im-
mensity of detail would soon lead it astray and bewilder its
discernment: in this strait, man has recourse to an imperfect
but necessary expedient, which at once assists and demon-
strates his weakness. Having superficially considered a cer-

which I never heard mentioned before. There is not a medio-
cre scribbler who does not try his hand at discovering truths
applicable to a great kingdom, and who is very ill pleased with
himself if he does not succeed in compressing the human race
into the compass of an article. So great a dissimilarity between
two very enlightened nations surprises me. If I again turn my
attention to England, and observe the events which have oc-
curred there in the last half-century, I think I may affirm that
a taste for general ideas increases in that country in proportion
as its ancient constitution is weakened.
The state of civilization is therefore insufficient by itself to
explain what suggests to the human mind the love of general
ideas, or diverts it from them. When the conditions of men
are very unequal, and inequality itself is the permanent state
of society, individual men gradually become so dissimilar
that each class assumes the aspect of a distinct race: only one
of these classes is ever in view at the same instant; and losing
sight of that general tie which binds them all within the vast
bosom of mankind, the observation invariably rests not on
man, but on certain men. Those who live in this aristocratic
state of society never, therefore, conceive very general ideas

respecting themselves, and that is enough to imbue them
with an habitual distrust of such ideas, and an instinctive
aversion of them. He, on the contrary, who inhabits a demo-
cratic country, sees around him, one very hand, men differ-
ing but little from each other; he cannot turn his mind to
any one portion of mankind, without expanding and dilat-
ing his thought till it embrace the whole. All the truths which
are applicable to himself, appear to him equally and simi-
larly applicable to each of his fellow-citizens and fellow-men.
Having contracted the habit of generalizing his ideas in the
study which engages him most, and interests him more than
others, he transfers the same habit to all his pursuits; and
thus it is that the craving to discover general laws in every-
thing, to include a great number of objects under the same
formula, and to explain a mass of facts by a single cause,
becomes an ardent, and sometimes an undiscerning, passion
in the human mind.
Nothing shows the truth of this proposition more clearly
than the opinions of the ancients respecting their slaves. The
most profound and capacious minds of Rome and Greece
were never able to reach the idea, at once so general and so

simple, of the common likeness of men, and of the common
birthright of each to freedom: they strove to prove that sla-
very was in the order of nature, and that it would always
exist. Nay, more, everything shows that those of the ancients
who had passed from the servile to the free condition, many
of whom have left us excellent writings, did themselves re-
gard servitude in no other light.
All the great writers of antiquity belonged to the aristoc-
racy of masters, or at least they saw that aristocracy estab-
lished and uncontested before their eyes. Their mind, after it
had expanded itself in several directions, was barred from
further progress in this one; and the advent of Jesus Christ
upon earth was required to teach that all the members of the
human race are by nature equal and alike.
In the ages of equality all men are independent of each
other, isolated and weak. The movements of the multitude
are not permanently guided by the will of any individuals; at
such times humanity seems always to advance of itself. In
order, therefore, to explain what is passing in the world, man
is driven to seek for some great causes, which, acting in the
same manner on all our fellow-creatures, thus impel them

all involuntarily to pursue the same track. This again natu-
rally leads the human mind to conceive general ideas, and
superinduces a taste for them.
I have already shown in what way the equality of condi-
tions leads every man to investigate truths for himself. It
may readily be perceived that a method of this kind must
insensibly beget a tendency to general ideas in the human
mind. When I repudiate the traditions of rank, profession,
and birth; when I escape from the authority of example, to
seek out, by the single effort of my reason, the path to be
followed, I am inclined to derive the motives of my opinions
from human nature itself; which leads me necessarily, and
almost unconsciously, to adopt a great number of very gen-
eral notions.
All that I have here said explains the reasons for which the
English display much less readiness and taste or the generali-
zation of ideas than their American progeny, and still less
again than their French neighbors; and likewise the reason
for which the English of the present day display more of
these qualities than their forefathers did. The English have
long been a very enlightened and a very aristocratic nation;

sought in the productions of the mind is easy pleasure and
information without labor.
If aristocratic nations do not make sufficient use of general
ideas, and frequently treat them with inconsiderate disdain,
it is true, on the other hand, that a democratic people is ever
ready to carry ideas of this kind to excess, and to espouse the
with injudicious warmth.

Chapter IV: Why the Americans Have Never
Been so Eager as the French for General Ideas in
Political Matters

I observed in the last chapter, that the Americans show a less
decided taste for general ideas than the French; this is more
especially true in political matters. Although the Americans
infuse into their legislation infinitely more general ideas than
the English, and although they pay much more attention
than the latter people to the adjustment of the practice of
affairs to theory, no political bodies in the United States have
ever shown so warm an attachment to general ideas as the
Constituent Assembly and the Convention in France. At no

politics which the principle of equality suggests.

Chapter V: Of the Manner in Which Religion in
The United States Avails Itself of Democratic
Tendencies

I have laid it down in a preceding chapter that men cannot
do without dogmatical belief; and even that it is very much
to be desired that such belief should exist amongst them. I
now add, that of all the kinds of dogmatical belief the most
desirable appears to me to be dogmatical belief in matters of
religion; and this is a very clear inference, even from no higher
consideration than the interests of this world. There is hardly
any human action, however particular a character be assigned
to it, which does not originate in some very general idea
men have conceived of the Deity, of his relation to man-
kind, of the nature of their own souls, and of their duties to
their fellow-creatures. Nor can anything prevent these ideas
from being the common spring from which everything else
emanates. Men are therefore immeasurably interested in ac-
quiring fixed ideas of God, of the soul, and of their common

are religions which are very false and very absurd; but it may
be affirmed, that any religion which remains within the circle
I have just traced, without aspiring to go beyond it (as many
religions have attempted to do, for the purpose of enclosing
on every side the free progress of the human mind), imposes
a salutary restraint on the intellect; and it must be admitted
that, if it do not save men in another world, such religion is
at least very conducive to their happiness and their greatness
in this. This is more especially true of men living in free
countries. When the religion of a people is destroyed, doubt
gets hold of the highest portions of the intellect, and half
paralyzes all the rest of its powers. Every man accustoms him-
self to entertain none but confused and changing notions on
the subjects most interesting to his fellow-creatures and him-
self. His opinions are ill-defended and easily abandoned: and,
despairing of ever resolving by himself the hardest problems
of the destiny of man, he ignobly submits to think no more
about them. Such a condition cannot but enervate the soul,
relax the springs of the will, and prepare a people for servi-
tude. Nor does it only happen, in such a case, that they al-
low their freedom to be wrested from them; they frequently

themselves surrender it. When there is no longer any prin-
ciple of authority in religion any more than in politics, men
are speedily frightened at the aspect of this unbounded inde-
pendence. The constant agitation of all surrounding things
alarms and exhausts them. As everything is at sea in the sphere
of the intellect, they determine at least that the mechanism
of society should be firm and fixed; and as they cannot re-
sume their ancient belief, they assume a master.
For my own part, I doubt whether man can ever support
at the same time complete religious independence and en-
tire public freedom. And I am inclined to think, that if faith
be wanting in him, he must serve; and if he be free, he must
believe.
Perhaps, however, this great utility of religions is still more
obvious amongst nations where equality of conditions pre-
vails than amongst others. It must be acknowledged that
equality, which brings great benefits into the world, never-
theless suggests to men (as will be shown hereafter) some
very dangerous propensities. It tends to isolate them from
each other, to concentrate every man’s attention upon him-
self; and it lays open the soul to an inordinate love of mate-

it is possible to maintain a religion without external obser-
vances; but, on the other hand, I am persuaded that, in the
ages upon which we are entering, it would be peculiarly dan-
gerous to multiply them beyond measure; and that they ought
rather to be limited to as much as is absolutely necessary to
perpetuate the doctrine itself, which is the substance of reli-
gions of which the ritual is only the form.* A religion which
should become more minute, more peremptory, and more
surcharged with small observances at a time in which men
are becoming more equal, would soon find itself reduced to
a band of fanatical zealots in the midst of an infidel people.
I anticipate the objection, that as all religions have general
and eternal truths for their object, they cannot thus shape
themselves to the shifting spirit of every age without forfeit-
ing their claim to certainty in the eyes of mankind. To this I
reply again, that the principal opinions which constitute

*In all religions there are some ceremonies which are inher-
ent in the substance of the faith itself, and in these nothing
should, on any account, be changed. This is especially the
case with Roman Catholicism, in which the doctrine and
the form are frequently so closely united as to form one point
of belief.

All the American clergy know and respect the intellectual
supremacy exercised by the majority; they never sustain any
but necessary conflicts with it. They take no share in the
altercations of parties, but they readily adopt the general
opinions of their country and their age; and they allow them-
selves to be borne away without opposition in the current of
feeling and opinion by which everything around them is car-
ried along. They endeavor to amend their contemporaries,
but they do not quit fellowship with them. Public opinion is
therefore never hostile to them; it rather supports and pro-
tects them; and their belief owes its authority at the same
time to the strength which is its own, and to that which they
borrow from the opinions of the majority. Thus it is that, by
respecting all democratic tendencies not absolutely contrary
to herself, and by making use of several of them for her own
purposes, religion sustains an advantageous struggle with that
spirit of individual independence which is her most danger-
ous antagonist.

Book One  – Chapters VI – IX

Chapter VI: Of the Progress of Roman Catholi-
cism in The United States

America is the most democratic country in the world, and it
is at the same time (according to reports worthy of belief)
the country in which the Roman Catholic religion makes
most progress. At first sight this is surprising. Two things
must here be accurately distinguished: equality inclines men
to wish to form their own opinions; but, on the other hand,
it imbues them with the taste and the idea of unity, simplic-
ity, and impartiality in the power which governs society. Men
living in democratic ages are therefore very prone to shake
off all religious authority; but if they consent to subject them-
selves to any authority of this kind, they choose at least that
it should be single and uniform. Religious powers not radi-
ating from a common centre are naturally repugnant to their
minds; and they almost as readily conceive that there should
be no religion, as that there should be several. At the present
time, more than in any preceding one, Roman Catholics are

parts of their faith from its influence, and to keep their minds
floating at random between liberty and obedience. But I am
inclined to believe that the number of these thinkers will be
less in democratic than in other ages; and that our posterity
will tend more and more to a single division into two parts -
some relinquishing Christianity entirely, and others return-
ing to the bosom of the Church of Rome.

Chapter VII: Of the Cause of a Leaning to Pan-
theism Amongst Democratic Nations

I shall take occasion hereafter to show under what form the
preponderating taste of a democratic people for very general
ideas manifests itself in politics; but I would point out, at
the present stage of my work, its principal effect on philoso-
phy. It cannot be denied that pantheism has made great
progress in our age. The writings of a part of Europe bear
visible marks of it: the Germans introduce it into philoso-
phy, and the French into literature. Most of the works of
imagination published in France contain some opinions or
some tinge caught from pantheistical doctrines, or they dis-

close some tendency to such doctrines in their authors. This
appears to me not only to proceed from an accidental, but
from a permanent cause.
When the conditions of society are becoming more equal,
and each individual man becomes more like all the rest, more
weak and more insignificant, a habit grows up of ceasing to
notice the citizens to consider only the people, and of over-
looking individuals to think only of their kind. At such times
the human mind seeks to embrace a multitude of different
objects at once; and it constantly strives to succeed in con-
necting a variety of consequences with a single cause. The
idea of unity so possesses itself of man, and is sought for by
him so universally, that if he thinks he has found it, he readily
yields himself up to repose in that belief. Nor does he con-
tent himself with the discovery that nothing is in the world
but a creation and a Creator; still embarrassed by this pri-
mary division of things, he seeks to expand and to simplify
his conception by including God and the universe in one
great whole. If there be a philosophical system which teaches
that all things material and immaterial, visible and invisible,
which the world contains, are only to be considered as the

several parts of an immense Being, which alone remains un-
changed amidst the continual change and ceaseless transfor-
mation of all that constitutes it, we may readily infer that
such a system, although it destroy the individuality of man -
nay, rather because it destroys that individuality - will have
secret charms for men living in democracies. All their habits
of thought prepare them to conceive it, and predispose them
to adopt it. It naturally attracts and fixes their imagination;
it fosters the pride, whilst it soothes the indolence, of their
minds. Amongst the different systems by whose aid philoso-
phy endeavors to explain the universe, I believe pantheism
to be one of those most fitted to seduce the human mind in
democratic ages. Against it all who abide in their attachment
to the true greatness of man should struggle and combine.

Chapter VIII: The Principle of Equality Suggests
to the Americans the Idea of the Indefinite Per-
fectibility of Man

Equality suggests to the human mind several ideas which
would not have originated from any other source, and it

gation is every day making such rapid progress, that the fin-
est vessel would become almost useless if it lasted beyond a
certain number of years. In these words, which fell acciden-
tally and on a particular subject from a man of rude attain-
ments, I recognize the general and systematic idea upon which
a great people directs all its concerns.
Aristocratic nations are naturally too apt to narrow the scope
of human perfectibility; democratic nations to expand it be-
yond compass.

Chapter IX: The Example of the Americans Does
Not Prove That a Democratic People Can Have
No Aptitude and No Taste for Science, Litera-
ture, or Art

It must be acknowledged that amongst few of the civilized
nations of our time have the higher sciences made less progress
than in the United States; and in few have great artists, fine
poets, or celebrated writers been more rare. Many Europe-
ans, struck by this fact, have looked upon it as a natural and
inevitable result of equality; and they have supposed that if a

and the labors of the intellect, is there swayed by no impulse
but the pursuit of wealth. Not only are manufacturing and
commercial classes to be found in the United States, as they
are in all other countries; but what never occurred elsewhere,
the whole community is simultaneously engaged in produc-
tive industry and commerce. I am convinced that, if the
Americans had been alone in the world, with the freedom
and the knowledge acquired by their forefathers, and the
passions which are their own, they would not have been slow
to discover that progress cannot long be made in the appli-
cation of the sciences without cultivating the theory of them;
that all the arts are perfected by one another: and, however
absorbed they might have been by the pursuit of the princi-
pal object of their desires, they would speedily have admit-
ted, that it is necessary to turn aside from it occasionally, in
order the better to attain it in the end.
The taste for the pleasures of the mind is moreover so natu-
ral to the heart of civilized man, that amongst the polite na-
tions, which are least disposed to give themselves up to these
pursuits, a certain number of citizens are always to be found
who take part in them. This intellectual craving, when once

able, though in different degrees, to indulge in the pursuits
and pleasures of the intellect. In those pleasures they will
indulge; for if it be true that the human mind leans on one
side to the narrow, the practical, and the useful, it naturally
rises on the other to the infinite, the spiritual, and the beau-
tiful. Physical wants confine it to the earth; but, as soon as
the tie is loosened, it will unbend itself again.
Not only will the number of those who can take an inter-
est in the productions of the mind be enlarged, but the taste
for intellectual enjoyment will descend, step by step, even to
those who, in aristocratic societies, seem to have neither time
nor ability to in indulge in them. When hereditary wealth,
the privileges of rank, and the prerogatives of birth have ceased
to be, and when every man derives his strength from himself
alone, it becomes evident that the chief cause of disparity
between the fortunes of men is the mind. Whatever tends to
invigorate, to extend, or to adorn the mind, instantly rises to
great value. The utility of knowledge becomes singularly con-
spicuous even to the eyes of the multitude: those who have
no taste for its charms set store upon its results, and make
some efforts to acquire it. In free and enlightened demo-

cratic ages, there is nothing to separate men from each other
or to retain them in their peculiar sphere; they rise or sink
with extreme rapidity. All classes live in perpetual intercourse
from their great proximity to each other. They communi-
cate and intermingle every day – they imitate and envy one
other: this suggests to the people many ideas, notions, and
desires which it would never have entertained if the distinc-
tions of rank had been fixed and society at rest. In such na-
tions the servant never considers himself as an entire stranger
to the pleasures and toils of his master, nor the poor man to
those of the rich; the rural population assimilates itself to
that of the towns, and the provinces to the capital. No one
easily allows himself to be reduced to the mere material cares
of life; and the humblest artisan casts at times an eager and a
furtive glance into the higher regions of the intellect. People
do not read with the same notions or in the same manner as
they do in an aristocratic community; but the circle of read-
ers is unceasingly expanded, till it includes all the citizens.
As soon as the multitude begins to take an interest in the
labors of the mind, it finds out that to excel in some of them
is a powerful method of acquiring fame, power, or wealth.

The restless ambition which equality begets instantly takes
this direction as it does all others. The number of those who
cultivate science, letters, and the arts, becomes immense. The
intellectual world starts into prodigious activity: everyone
endeavors to open for himself a path there, and to draw the
eyes of the public after him. Something analogous occurs to
what happens in society in the United States, politically con-
sidered. What is done is often imperfect, but the attempts
are innumerable; and, although the results of individual ef-
fort are commonly very small, the total amount is always
very large.
It is therefore not true to assert that men living in demo-
cratic ages are naturally indifferent to science, literature, and
the arts: only it must be acknowledged that they cultivate
them after their own fashion, and bring to the task their
own peculiar qualifications and deficiencies.

Book One – Chapters X – XII

Chapter X: Why the Americans Are More Ad-
dicted to Practical Than to Theoretical Science

If a democratic state of society and democratic institutions
do not stop the career of the human mind, they incontest-
ably guide it in one direction in preference to another. Their
effects, thus circumscribed, are still exceedingly great; and I
trust I may be pardoned if I pause for a moment to survey
them. We had occasion, in speaking of the philosophical
method of the American people, to make several remarks
which must here be turned to account.
Equality begets in man the desire of judging of everything
for himself: it gives him, in all things, a taste for the tangible
and the real, a contempt for tradition and for forms. These
general tendencies are principally discernible in the peculiar
subject of this chapter. Those who cultivate the sciences
amongst a democratic people are always afraid of losing their
way in visionary speculation. They mistrust systems; they
adhere closely to facts and the study of facts with their own

or learned demonstrations; a rapid glance at particular inci-
dents, the daily study of the fleeting passions of the multi-
tude, the accidents of the time, and the art of turning them
to account, decide all its affairs.
In the ages in which active life is the condition of almost
everyone, men are therefore generally led to attach an exces-
sive value to the rapid bursts and superficial conceptions of
the intellect; and, on the other hand, to depreciate below
their true standard its slower and deeper labors. This opin-
ion of the public influences the judgment of the men who
cultivate the sciences; they are persuaded that they may suc-
ceed in those pursuits without meditation, or deterred from
such pursuits as demand it.
There are several methods of studying the sciences.
Amongst a multitude of men you will find a selfish, mercan-
tile, and trading taste for the discoveries of the mind, which
must not be confounded with that disinterested passion
which is kindled in the heart of the few. A desire to utilize
knowledge is one thing; the pure desire to know is another. I
do not doubt that in a few minds and far between, an ar-
dent, inexhaustible love of truth springs up, self-supported,

and living in ceaseless fruition without ever attaining the satis-
faction which it seeks. This ardent love it is – this proud, dis-
interested love of what is true – which raises men to the ab-
stract sources of truth, to draw their mother-knowledge thence.
If Pascal had had nothing in view but some large gain, or even
if he had been stimulated by the love of fame alone, I cannot
conceive that he would ever have been able to rally all the
powers of his mind, as he did, for the better discovery of the
most hidden things of the Creator. When I see him, as it were,
tear his soul from the midst of all the cares of life to devote it
wholly to these researches, and, prematurely snapping the links
which bind the frame to life, die of old age before forty, I
stand amazed, and I perceive that no ordinary cause is at work
to produce efforts so extra-ordinary.
The future will prove whether these passions, at once so
rare and so productive, come into being and into growth as
easily in the midst of democratic as in aristocratic communi-
ties. For myself, I confess that I am slow to believe it. In
aristocratic society, the class which gives the tone to opinion,
and has the supreme guidance of affairs, being permanently
and hereditarily placed above the multitude, naturally con-

ever be the spirit of his country or his age. He requires no
assistance in his course – enough that he be not checked in it.
All that I mean to say is this: – permanent inequality of
conditions leads men to confine themselves to the arrogant
and sterile research of abstract truths; whilst the social con-
dition and the institutions of democracy prepare them to
seek the immediate and useful practical results of the sci-
ences. This tendency is natural and inevitable: it is curious
to be acquainted with it, and it may be necessary to point it
out. If those who are called upon to guide the nations of our
time clearly discerned from afar off these new tendencies,
which will soon be irresistible, they would understand that,
possessing education and freedom, men living in democratic
ages cannot fail to improve the industrial part of science;
and that henceforward all the efforts of the constituted au-
thorities ought to be directed to support the highest branches
of learning, and to foster the nobler passion for science itself.
In the present age the human mind must be coerced into
theoretical studies; it runs of its own accord to practical ap-
plications; and, instead of perpetually referring it to the
minute examination of secondary effects, it is well to divert

motionless state in which they found the minds of this people.
The Chinese, in following the track of their forefathers, had
forgotten the reasons by which the latter had been guided.
They still used the formula, without asking for its meaning:
they retained the instrument, but they no longer possessed
the art of altering or renewing it. The Chinese, then, had
lost the power of change; for them to improve was impos-
sible. They were compelled, at all times and in all points, to
imitate their predecessors, lest they should stray into utter
darkness, by deviating for an instant from the path already
laid down for them. The source of human knowledge was all
but dry; and though the stream still ran on, it could neither
swell its waters nor alter its channel. Notwithstanding this,
China had subsisted peaceably for centuries. The invaders
who had conquered the country assumed the manners of
the inhabitants, and order prevailed there. A sort of physical
prosperity was everywhere discernible: revolutions were rare,
and war was, so to speak, unknown.
It is then a fallacy to flatter ourselves with the reflection
that the barbarians are still far from us; for if there be some
nations which allow civilization to be torn from their grasp,
there are others who trample it themselves under their feet.

Chapter XI: Of the Spirit in Which the Ameri-
cans Cultivate the Arts

It would be to waste the time of my readers and my own if I
strove to demonstrate how the general mediocrity of fortunes,
the absence of superfluous wealth, the universal desire of
comfort, and the constant efforts by which everyone attempts
to procure it, make the taste for the useful predominate over
the love of the beautiful in the heart of man. Democratic
nations, amongst which all these things exist, will therefore
cultivate the arts which serve to render life easy, in prefer-
ence to those whose object is to adorn it. They will habitu-
ally prefer the useful to the beautiful, and they will require
that the beautiful should be useful. But I propose to go fur-
ther; and after having pointed out this first feature, to sketch
several others.
It commonly happens that in the ages of privilege the prac-
tice of almost all the arts becomes a privilege; and that every
profession is a separate walk, upon which it is not allowable
for everyone to enter. Even when productive industry is free,
the fixed character which belongs to aristocratic nations

gradually segregates all the persons who practise the same
art, till they form a distinct class, always composed of the
same families, whose members are all known to each other,
and amongst whom a public opinion of their own and a
species of corporate pride soon spring up. In a class or guild
of this kind, each artisan has not only his fortune to make,
but his reputation to preserve. He is not exclusively swayed
by his own interest, or even by that of his customer, but by
that of the body to which he belongs; and the interest of that
body is, that each artisan should produce the best possible
workmanship. In aristocratic ages, the object of the arts is
therefore to manufacture as well as possible – not with the
greatest despatch, or at the lowest rate.
When, on the contrary, every profession is open to all –
when a multitude of persons are constantly embracing and
abandoning it – and when its several members are strangers
to each other, indifferent, and from their numbers hardly
seen amongst themselves; the social tie is destroyed, and each
workman, standing alone, endeavors simply to gain the great-
est possible quantity of money at the least possible cost. The
will of the customer is then his only limit. But at the same

them at a low price to all. But there are only two ways of
lowering the price of commodities. The first is to discover
some better, shorter, and more ingenious method of produc-
ing them: the second is to manufacture a larger quantity of
goods, nearly similar, but of less value. Amongst a demo-
cratic population, all the intellectual faculties of the work-
man are directed to these two objects: he strives to invent
methods which may enable him not only to work better, but
quicker and cheaper; or, if he cannot succeed in that, to di-
minish the intrinsic qualities of the thing he makes, without
rendering it wholly unfit for the use for which it is intended.
When none but the wealthy had watches, they were almost
all very good ones: few are now made which are worth much,
but everybody has one in his pocket. Thus the democratic
principle not only tends to direct the human mind to the
useful arts, but it induces the artisan to produce with greater
rapidity a quantity of imperfect commodities, and the con-
sumer to content himself with these commodities.
Not that in democracies the arts are incapable of produc-
ing very commendable works, if such be required. This may
occasionally be the case, if customers appear who are ready

community, but they strive to give to all their commodities
attractive qualities which they do not in reality possess. In
the confusion of all ranks everyone hopes to appear what he
is not, and makes great exertions to succeed in this object.
This sentiment indeed, which is but too natural to the heart
of man, does not originate in the democratic principle; but
that principle applies it to material objects. To mimic virtue
is of every age; but the hypocrisy of luxury belongs more
particularly to the ages of democracy.
To satisfy these new cravings of human vanity the arts have
recourse to every species of imposture: and these devices some-
times go so far as to defeat their own purpose. Imitation
diamonds are now made which may be easily mistaken for
real ones; as soon as the art of fabricating false diamonds
shall have reached so high a degree of perfection that they
cannot be distinguished from real ones, it is probable that
both one and the other will be abandoned, and become mere
pebbles again.
This leads me to speak of those arts which are called the
fine arts, by way of distinction. I do not believe that it is a
necessary effect of a democratic social condition and of demo-

wonderfully depicted the models which they had before their
eyes, but they rarely imagined anything beyond them: they
followed nature with fidelity: whilst Raphael sought for some-
thing better than nature. They have left us an exact portrai-
ture of man; but he discloses in his works a glimpse of the
Divinity. This remark as to the manner of treating a subject
is no less applicable to the choice of it. The painters of the
Middle Ages generally sought far above themselves, and away
from their own time, for mighty subjects, which left to their
imagination an unbounded range. Our painters frequently
employ their talents in the exact imitation of the details of
private life, which they have always before their eyes; and
they are forever copying trivial objects, the originals of which
are only too abundant in nature.

Chapter XII: Why The Americans Raise Some Monu-
ments so Insignificant, and Others so Important

I have just observed, that in democratic ages monuments of
the arts tend to become more numerous and less important.
I now hasten to point out the exception to this rule. In a

quainted with the laws of hydraulics, they would not have
constructed all the aqueducts which surround the ruins of
their cities - they would have made a better use of their power
and their wealth. If they had invented the steam-engine, per-
haps they would not have extended to the extremities of their
empire those long artificial roads which are called Roman
roads. These things are at once the splendid memorials of
their ignorance and of their greatness. A people which should
leave no other vestige of its track than a few leaden pipes in
the earth and a few iron rods upon its surface, might have
been more the master of nature than the Romans.

Book One – Chapters XIII – XV

Chapter XIII: Literary Characteristics of Demo-
cratic Ages

When a traveller goes into a bookseller’s shop in the United
States, and examines the American books upon the shelves,
the number of works appears extremely great; whilst that of
known authors appears, on the contrary, to be extremely

of daily life - as they have never been so, any more than their
fathers were before them -they have learned to take an inter-
est, for several generations back, in the labors of the mind.
They have learned to understand literature as an art, to love
it in the end for its own sake, and to feel a scholar-like satis-
faction in seeing men conform to its rules. Nor is this all: the
men of whom I speak began and will end their lives in easy
or in affluent circumstances; hence they have naturally con-
ceived a taste for choice gratifications, and a love of refined
and delicate pleasures. Nay more, a kind of indolence of mind
and heart, which they frequently contract in the midst of
this long and peaceful enjoyment of so much welfare, leads
them to put aside, even from their pleasures, whatever might
be too startling or too acute. They had rather be amused
than intensely excited; they wish to be interested, but not to
be carried away.
Now let us fancy a great number of literary performances
executed by the men, or for the men, whom I have just de-
scribed, and we shall readily conceive a style of literature in
which everything will be regular and prearranged. The slight-
est work will be carefully touched in its least details; art and

becomes impotent - a fact which is as true in literature as it is
in politics.*

Let us now turn the picture and consider the other side of
it; let us transport ourselves into the midst of a democracy,
not unprepared by ancient traditions and present culture to
partake in the pleasures of the mind. Ranks are there inter-
mingled and confounded; knowledge and power are both
infinitely subdivided, and, if I may use the expression, scat-
tered on every side. Here then is a motley multitude, whose
intellectual wants are to be supplied. These new votaries of
the pleasures of the mind have not all received the same edu-
cation; they do not possess the same degree of culture as
their fathers, nor any resemblance to them – nay, they per-

petually differ from themselves, for they live in a state of
incessant change of place, feelings, and fortunes. The mind of
each member of the community is therefore unattached to
that of his fellow-citizens by tradition or by common habits;
and they have never had the power, the inclination, nor the
time to concert together. It is, however, from the bosom of
this heterogeneous and agitated mass that authors spring; and
from the same source their profits and their fame are distrib-
uted. I can without difficulty understand that, under these
circumstances, I must expect to meet in the literature of such
a people with but few of those strict conventional rules which
are admitted by readers and by writers in aristocratic ages. If it
should happen that the men of some one period were agreed
upon any such rules, that would prove nothing for the follow-
ing period; for amongst democratic nations each new genera-
tion is a new people. Amongst such nations, then, literature
will not easily be subjected to strict rules, and it is impossible
that any such rules should ever be permanent.
In democracies it is by no means the case that all the men
who cultivate literature have received a literary education;
and most of those who have some tinge of belles-lettres are

*All this is especially true of the aristocratic countries which
have been long and peacefully subject to a monarchical gov-
ernment. When liberty prevails in an aristocracy, the higher
ranks are constantly obliged to make use of the lower classes;
and when they use, they approach them. This frequently
introduces something of a democratic spirit into an aristo-
cratic community. There springs up, moreover, in a privi-
leged body, governing with energy and an habitually bold
policy, a taste for stir and excitement which must infallibly
affect all literary performances.

the periods of aristocracy, an aspect of order, regularity, sci-
ence, and art; its form will, on the contrary, ordinarily be
slighted, sometimes despised. Style will frequently be fantas-
tic, incorrect, overburdened, and loose – almost always ve-
hement and bold. Authors will aim at rapidity of execution,
more than at perfection of detail. Small productions will be
more common than bulky books; there will be more wit than
erudition, more imagination than profundity; and literary
performances will bear marks of an untutored and rude vigor
of thought -frequently of great variety and singular fecun-
dity. The object of authors will be to astonish rather than to
please, and to stir the passions more than to charm the taste.
Here and there, indeed, writers will doubtless occur who will
choose a different track, and who will, if they are gifted with
superior abilities, succeed in finding readers, in spite of their
defects or their better qualities; but these exceptions will be
rare, and even the authors who shall so depart from the re-
ceived practice in the main subject of their works, will al-
ways relapse into it in some lesser details.
I have just depicted two extreme conditions: the transition
by which a nation passes from the former to the latter is not

sudden but gradual, and marked with shades of very various
intensity. In the passage which conducts a lettered people
from the one to the other, there is almost always a moment
at which the literary genius of democratic nations has its
confluence with that of aristocracies, and both seek to estab-
lish their joint sway over the human mind. Such epochs are
transient, but very brilliant: they are fertile without exuber-
ance, and animated without confusion. The French litera-
ture of the eighteenth century may serve as an example.
I should say more than I mean if I were to assert that the
literature of a nation is always subordinate to its social con-
dition and its political constitution. I am aware that, inde-
pendently of these causes, there are several others which con-
fer certain characteristics on literary productions; but these
appear to me to be the chief. The relations which exist be-
tween the social and political condition of a people and the
genius of its authors are always very numerous: whoever
knows the one is never completely ignorant of the other.

Chapter XIV: The Trade of Literature

Democracy not only infuses a taste for letters among the
trading classes, but introduces a trading spirit into literature.
In aristocracies, readers are fastidious and few in number; in
democracies, they are far more numerous and far less diffi-
cult to please. The consequence is, that among aristocratic
nations, no one can hope to succeed without immense exer-
tions, and that these exertions may bestow a great deal of
fame, but can never earn much money; whilst among demo-
cratic nations, a writer may flatter himself that he will obtain
at a cheap rate a meagre reputation and a large fortune. For
this purpose he need not be admired; it is enough that he is
liked. The ever-increasing crowd of readers, and their con-
tinual craving for something new, insure the sale of books
which nobody much esteems.
In democratic periods the public frequently treat authors
as kings do their courtiers; they enrich, and they despise them.
What more is needed by the venal souls which are born in
courts, or which are worthy to live there? Democratic litera-
ture is always infested with a tribe of writers who look upon

letters as a mere trade: and for some few great authors who
adorn it you may reckon thousands of idea-mongers.

Chapter XV: The Study of Greek and Latin
Literature Peculiarly Useful in Democratic Com-
munities

What was called the People in the most democratic repub-
lics of antiquity, was very unlike what we designate by that
term. In Athens, all the citizens took part in public affairs;
but there were only 20,000 citizens to more than 350,000
inhabitants. All the rest were slaves, and discharged the greater
part of those duties which belong at the present day to the
lower or even to the middle classes. Athens, then, with her
universal suffrage, was after all merely an aristocratic repub-
lic in which all the nobles had an equal right to the govern-
ment. The struggle between the patricians and plebeians of
Rome must be considered in the same light: it was simply an
intestine feud between the elder and younger branches of
the same family. All the citizens belonged, in fact, to the
aristocracy, and partook of its character.

It is moreover to be remarked, that amongst the ancients
books were always scarce and dear; and that very great diffi-
culties impeded their publication and circulation. These cir-
cumstances concentrated literary tastes and habits amongst
a small number of men, who formed a small literary aristoc-
racy out of the choicer spirits of the great political aristoc-
racy. Accordingly nothing goes to prove that literature was
ever treated as a trade amongst the Greeks and Romans.
These peoples, which not only constituted aristocracies,
but very polished and free nations, of course imparted to
their literary productions the defects and the merits which
characterize the literature of aristocratic ages. And indeed a
very superficial survey of the literary remains of the ancients
will suffice to convince us, that if those writers were some-
times deficient in variety, or fertility in their subjects, or in
boldness, vivacity, or power of generalization in their
thoughts, they always displayed exquisite care and skill in
their details. Nothing in their works seems to be done hast-
ily or at random: every line is written for the eye of the con-
noisseur, and is shaped after some conception of ideal beauty.
No literature places those fine qualities, in which the writers

of democracies are naturally deficient, in bolder relief than
that of the ancients; no literature, therefore, ought to be more
studied in democratic ages. This study is better suited than
any other to combat the literary defects inherent in those
ages; as for their more praiseworthy literary qualities, they
will spring up of their own accord, without its being neces-
sary to learn to acquire them.
It is important that this point should be clearly under-
stood. A particular study may be useful to the literature of a
people, without being appropriate to its social and political
wants. If men were to persist in teaching nothing but the
literature of the dead languages in a community where ev-
eryone is habitually led to make vehement exertions to aug-
ment or to maintain his fortune, the result would be a very
polished, but a very dangerous, race of citizens. For as their
social and political condition would give them every day a
sense of wants which their education would never teach them
to supply, they would perturb the State, in the name of the
Greeks and Romans, instead of enriching it by their produc-
tive industry.
It is evident that in democratic communities the interest

of individuals, as well as the security of the commonwealth,
demands that the education of the greater number should
be scientific, commercial, and industrial, rather than liter-
ary. Greek and Latin should not be taught in all schools; but
it is important that those who by their natural disposition or
their fortune are destined to cultivate letters or prepared to
relish them, should find schools where a complete knowl-
edge of ancient literature may be acquired, and where the
true scholar may be formed. A few excellent universities would
do more towards the attainment of this object than a vast
number of bad grammar schools, where superfluous mat-
ters, badly learned, stand in the way of sound instruction in
necessary studies.
All who aspire to literary excellence in democratic nations,
ought frequently to refresh themselves at the springs of an-
cient literature: there is no more wholesome course for the
mind. Not that I hold the literary productions of the an-
cients to be irreproachable; but I think that they have some
especial merits, admirably calculated to counterbalance our
peculiar defects. They are a prop on the side on which we are
in most danger of falling.

Chapter XVI: The Effect of Democracy on Lan-
guage

If the reader has rightly understood what I have already said
on the subject of literature in general, he will have no diffi-
culty in comprehending that species of influence which a
democratic social condition and democratic institutions may
exercise over language itself, which is the chief instrument of
thought.
American authors may truly be said to live more in En-
gland than in their own country; since they constantly study
the English writers, and take them every day for their mod-
els. But such is not the case with the bulk of the population,
which is more immediately subjected to the peculiar causes
acting upon the United States. It is not then to the written,
but to the spoken language that attention must be paid, if
we would detect the modifications which the idiom of an
aristocratic people may undergo when it becomes the lan-
guage of a democracy.

state of repose in which everything remains. Few new words
are coined, because few new things are made; and even if
new things were made, they would be designated by known
words, whose meaning has been determined by tradition. If
it happens that the human mind bestirs itself at length, or is
roused by light breaking in from without, the novel expres-
sions which are introduced are characterized by a degree of
learning, intelligence, and philosophy, which shows that they
do not originate in a democracy. After the fall of
Constantinople had turned the tide of science and literature
towards the west, the French language was almost immedi-
ately invaded by a multitude of new words, which had all
Greek or Latin roots. An erudite neologism then sprang up
in France which was confined to the educated classes, and
which produced no sensible effect, or at least a very gradual
one, upon the people. All the nations of Europe successively
exhibited the same change. Milton alone introduced more
than six hundred words into the English language, almost
all derived from the Latin, the Greek, or the Hebrew. The
constant agitation which prevails in a democratic commu-
nity tends unceasingly, on the contrary, to change the char-

eral ideas, and that this arises from their peculiar merits and
defects. This liking for general ideas is displayed in demo-
cratic languages by the continual use of generic terms or ab-
stract expressions, and by the manner in which they are em-
ployed. This is the great merit and the great imperfection of
these languages. Democratic nations are passionately addicted
to generic terms or abstract expressions, because these modes
of speech enlarge thought, and assist the operations of the
mind by enabling it to include several objects in a small com-
pass. A French democratic writer will be apt to say capacites
in the abstract for men of capacity, and without particulariz-
ing the objects to which their capacity is applied: he will talk
about actualites to designate in one word the things passing
before his eyes at the instant; and he will comprehend under
the term eventualites whatever may happen in the universe,
dating from the moment at which he speaks. Democratic
writers are perpetually coining words of this kind, in which
they sublimate into further abstraction the abstract terms of
the language. Nay, more, to render their mode of speech
more succinct, they personify the subject of these abstract
terms, and make it act like a real entity. Thus they would say

in French, “La force des choses veut que les capacites
gouvernent.”
I cannot better illustrate what I mean than by my own
example. I have frequently used the word “equality” in an
absolute sense - nay, I have personified equality in several
places; thus I have said that equality does such and such
things, or refrains from doing others. It may be affirmed
that the writers of the age of Louis XIV would not have used
these expressions: they would never have thought of using
the word “equality” without applying it to some particular
object; and they would rather have renounced the term alto-
gether than have consented to make a living personage of it.
These abstract terms which abound in democratic lan-
guages, and which are used on every occasion without at-
taching them to any particular fact, enlarge and obscure the
thoughts they are intended to convey; they render the mode
of speech more succinct, and the idea contained in it less
clear. But with regard to language, democratic nations prefer
obscurity to labor. I know not indeed whether this loose style
has not some secret charm for those who speak and write
amongst these nations. As the men who live there are fre-

quently left to the efforts of their individual powers of mind,
they are almost always a prey to doubt; and as their situation
in life is forever changing, they are never held fast to any of
their opinions by the certain tenure of their fortunes. Men
living in democratic countries are, then, apt to entertain
unsettled ideas, and they require loose expressions to convey
them. As they never know whether the idea they express to-
day will be appropriate to the new position they may occupy
to-morrow, they naturally acquire a liking for abstract terms.
An abstract term is like a box with a false bottom: you may
put in it what ideas you please, and take them out again
without being observed.
Amongst all nations, generic and abstract terms form the
basis of language. I do not, therefore, affect to expel these
terms from democratic languages; I simply remark that men
have an especial tendency, in the ages of democracy, to mul-
tiply words of this kind – to take them always by themselves
in their most abstract acceptation, and to use them on all
occasions, even when the nature of the discourse does not
require them.

Chapter XVII: Of Some of the Sources of Poetry
Amongst Democratic Nations

Various different significations have been given to the word
“poetry.” It would weary my readers if I were to lead them
into a discussion as to which of these definitions ought to be
selected: I prefer telling them at once that which I have cho-
sen. In my opinion, poetry is the search and the delineation
of the ideal. The poet is he who, by suppressing a part of
what exists, by adding some imaginary touches to the pic-
ture, and by combining certain real circumstances, but which
do not in fact concurrently happen, completes and extends
the work of nature. Thus the object of poetry is not to repre-
sent what is true, but to adorn it, and to present to the mind
some loftier imagery. Verse, regarded as the ideal beauty of
language, may be eminently poetical; but verse does not, of
itself, constitute poetry.
I now proceed to inquire whether, amongst the actions,
the sentiments, and the opinions of democratic nations, there
are any which lead to a conception of ideal beauty, and which
may for this reason be considered as natural sources of po-

tion of positive religions, as well as to the stability of politi-
cal institutions. It not only keeps the human mind within a
certain sphere of belief, but it predisposes the mind to adopt
one faith rather than another. An aristocratic people will al-
ways be prone to place intermediate powers between God
and man. In this respect it may be said that the aristocratic
element is favorable to poetry. When the universe is peopled
with supernatural creatures, not palpable to the senses but
discovered by the mind, the imagination ranges freely, and
poets, finding a thousand subjects to delineate, also find a
countless audience to take an interest in their productions.
In democratic ages it sometimes happens, on the contrary,
that men are as much afloat in matters of belief as they are in
their laws. Scepticism then draws the imagination of poets
back to earth, and confines them to the real and visible world.
Even when the principle of equality does not disturb reli-
gious belief, it tends to simplify it, and to divert attention
from secondary agents, to fix it principally on the Supreme
Power. Aristocracy naturally leads the human mind to the
contemplation of the past, and fixes it there. Democracy, on
the contrary, gives men a sort of instinctive distaste for what

ture, becomes an abundant mine of poetry. The poets who
lived in aristocratic ages have been eminently successful in
their delineations of certain incidents in the life of a people
or a man; but none of them ever ventured to include within
his performances the destinies of mankind – a task which
poets writing in democratic ages may attempt. At that same
time at which every man, raising his eyes above his country,
begins at length to discern mankind at large, the Divinity is
more and more manifest to the human mind in full and
entire majesty. If in democratic ages faith in positive reli-
gions be often shaken, and the belief in intermediate agents,
by whatever name they are called, be overcast; on the other
hand men are disposed to conceive a far broader idea of Provi-
dence itself, and its interference in human affairs assumes a
new and more imposing appearance to their eyes. Looking
at the human race as one great whole, they easily conceive
that its destinies are regulated by the same design; and in the
actions of every individual they are led to acknowledge a
trace of that universal and eternal plan on which God rules
our race. This consideration may be taken as another pro-
lific source of poetry which is opened in democratic ages.

of the hidden depths in the immaterial nature of man. I need
not to ramble over earth and sky to discover a wondrous
object woven of contrasts, of greatness and littleness infi-
nite, of intense gloom and of amazing brightness – capable
at once of exciting pity, admiration, terror, contempt. I find
that object in myself. Man springs out of nothing, crosses
time, and disappears forever in the bosom of God; he is seen
but for a moment, staggering on the verge of the two abysses,
and there he is lost. If man were wholly ignorant of himself,
he would have no poetry in him; for it is impossible to de-
scribe what the mind does not conceive. If man clearly dis-
cerned his own nature, his imagination would remain idle,
and would have nothing to add to the picture. But the na-
ture of man is sufficiently disclosed for him to apprehend
something of himself; and sufficiently obscure for all the rest
to be plunged in thick darkness, in which he gropes forever -
and forever in vain – to lay hold on some completer notion
of his being.
Amongst a democratic people poetry will not be fed with
legendary lays or the memorials of old traditions. The poet
will not attempt to people the universe with supernatural

beings in whom his readers and his own fancy have ceased to
believe; nor will he present virtues and vices in the mask of
frigid personification, which are better received under their
own features. All these resources fail him; but Man remains,
and the poet needs no more. The destinies of mankind -
man himself, taken aloof from his age and his country, and
standing in the presence of Nature and of God, with his
passions, his doubts, his rare prosperities, and inconceivable
wretchedness – will become the chief, if not the sole theme
of poetry amongst these nations. Experience may confirm
this assertion, if we consider the productions of the greatest
poets who have appeared since the world has been turned to
democracy. The authors of our age who have so admirably
delineated the features of Faust, Childe Harold, Rene, and
Jocelyn, did not seek to record the actions of an individual,
but to enlarge and to throw light on some of the obscurer
recesses of the human heart. Such are the poems of democ-
racy. The principle of equality does not then destroy all the
subjects of poetry: it renders them less numerous, but more
vast.

Chapter XVIII: Of the Inflated Style of Ameri-
can Writers and Orators

I have frequently remarked that the Americans, who gener-
ally treat of business in clear, plain language, devoid of all
ornament, and so extremely simple as to be often coarse, are
apt to become inflated as soon as they attempt a more poeti-
cal diction. They then vent their pomposity from one end of
a harangue to the other; and to hear them lavish imagery on
every occasion, one might fancy that they never spoke of
anything with simplicity. The English are more rarely given
to a similar failing. The cause of this may be pointed out
without much difficulty. In democratic communities each
citizen is habitually engaged in the contemplation of a very
puny object, namely himself. If he ever raises his looks higher,
he then perceives nothing but the immense form of society
at large, or the still more imposing aspect of mankind. His
ideas are all either extremely minute and clear, or extremely
general and vague: what lies between is an open void. When
he has been drawn out of his own sphere, therefore, he al-
ways expects that some amazing object will be offered to his

in what is real and true, abandon them entirely and create
monsters. I do not fear that the poetry of democratic nations
will prove too insipid, or that it will fly too near the ground;
I rather apprehend that it will be forever losing itself in the
clouds, and that it will range at last to purely imaginary re-
gions. I fear that the productions of democratic poets may
often be surcharged with immense and incoherent imagery,
with exaggerated descriptions and strange creations; and that
the fantastic beings of their brain may sometimes make us
regret the world of reality.

Chapter XIX: Some Observations on the Drama
Amongst Democratic Nations

When the revolution which subverts the social and political
state of an aristocratic people begins to penetrate into litera-
ture, it generally first manifests itself in the drama, and it
always remains conspicuous there. The spectator of a dra-
matic piece is, to a certain extent, taken by surprise by the

of democracy, for, as we have just seen, even in aristocracies
it may happen that democratic tastes affect the drama; but
when the spirit of aristocracy reigns exclusively on the stage,
the fact irrefragably demonstrates that the whole of society
is aristocratic; and it may be boldly inferred that the same
lettered and learned class which sways the dramatic writers
commands the people and governs the country.
The refined tastes and the arrogant bearing of an aristocracy
will rarely fail to lead it, when it manages the stage, to make a
kind of selection in human nature. Some of the conditions of
society claim its chief interest; and the scenes which delineate
their manners are preferred upon the stage. Certain virtues,
and even certain vices, are thought more particularly to de-
serve to figure there; and they are applauded whilst all others
are excluded. Upon the stage, as well as elsewhere, an aristo-
cratic audience will only meet personages of quality, and share
the emotions of kings. The same thing applies to style: an
aristocracy is apt to impose upon dramatic authors certain
modes of expression which give the key in which everything is
to be delivered. By these means the stage frequently comes to
delineate only one side of man, or sometimes even to repre-

details, which may be perceived in the study, but which es-
cape attention on the stage. For, after all, the principal ob-
ject of a dramatic piece is to be performed, and its chief merit
is to affect the audience. But the audience and the readers in
that age were the same: on quitting the theatre they called
up the author for judgment to their own firesides. In de-
mocracies, dramatic pieces are listened to, but not read. Most
of those who frequent the amusements of the stage do not
go there to seek the pleasures of the mind, but the keen emo-
tions of the heart. They do not expect to hear a fine literary
work, but to see a play; and provided the author writes the
language of his country correctly enough to be understood,
and that his characters excite curiosity and awaken sympa-
thy, the audience are satisfied. They ask no more of fiction,
and immediately return to real life. Accuracy of style is there-
fore less required, because the attentive observance of its rules
is less perceptible on the stage. As for the probability of the
plot, it is incompatible with perpetual novelty, surprise, and
rapidity of invention. It is therefore neglected, and the pub-
lic excuses the neglect. You may be sure that if you succeed
in bringing your audience into the presence of something

that affects them, they will not care by what road you brought
them there; and they will never reproach you for having ex-
cited their emotions in spite of dramatic rules.
The Americans very broadly display all the different pro-
pensities which I have here described when they go to the
theatres; but it must be acknowledged that as yet a very small
number of them go to theatres at all. Although playgoers
and plays have prodigiously increased in the United States
in the last forty years, the population indulges in this kind of
amusement with the greatest reserve. This is attributable to
peculiar causes, which the reader is already acquainted with,
and of which a few words will suffice to remind him. The
Puritans who founded the American republics were not only
enemies to amusements, but they professed an especial ab-
horrence for the stage. They considered it as an abominable
pastime; and as long as their principles prevailed with undi-
vided sway, scenic performances were wholly unknown
amongst them. These opinions of the first fathers of the
colony have left very deep marks on the minds of their de-
scendants. The extreme regularity of habits and the great
strictness of manners which are observable in the United

States, have as yet opposed additional obstacles to the growth
of dramatic art. There are no dramatic subjects in a country
which has witnessed no great political catastrophes, and in
which love invariably leads by a straight and easy road to
matrimony. People who spend every day in the week in mak-
ing money, and the Sunday in going to church, have noth-
ing to invite the muse of Comedy.
A single fact suffices to show that the stage is not very
popular in the United States. The Americans, whose laws
allow of the utmost freedom and even license of language in
all other respects, have nevertheless subjected their dramatic
authors to a sort of censorship. Theatrical performances can
only take place by permission of the municipal authorities.
This may serve to show how much communities are like
individuals; they surrender themselves unscrupulously to their
ruling passions, and afterwards take the greatest care not to
yield too much to the vehemence of tastes which they do
not possess.
No portion of literature is connected by closer or more
numerous ties with the present condition of society than the
drama. The drama of one period can never be suited to the

following age, if in the interval an important revolution has
changed the manners and the laws of the nation. The great
authors of a preceding age may be read; but pieces written
for a different public will not be followed. The dramatic au-
thors of the past live only in books. The traditional taste of
certain individuals, vanity, fashion, or the genius of an actor
may sustain or resuscitate for a time the aristocratic drama
amongst a democracy; but it will speedily fall away of itself -
not overthrown, but abandoned.

Chapter XX: Characteristics of Historians in
Democratic Ages

Historians who write in aristocratic ages are wont to refer all
occurrences to the particular will or temper of certain indi-
viduals; and they are apt to attribute the most important
revolutions to very slight accidents. They trace out the smallest
causes with sagacity, and frequently leave the greatest unper-
ceived. Historians who live in democratic ages exhibit pre-
cisely opposite characteristics. Most of them attribute hardly
any influence to the individual over the destiny of the race,

exaggerated system of general causes affords surprising con-
solations to second-rate statesmen. I will add, that its effects
are not less consolatory to second-rate historians; it can al-
ways furnish a few mighty reasons to extricate them from
the most difficult part of their work, and it indulges the in-
dolence or incapacity of their minds, whilst it confers upon
them the honors of deep thinking.
For myself, I am of opinion that at all times one great por-
tion of the events of this world are attributable to general
facts, and another to special influences. These two kinds of
cause are always in operation: their proportion only varies.
General facts serve to explain more things in democratic than
in aristocratic ages, and fewer things are then assignable to
special influences. At periods of aristocracy the reverse takes
place: special influences are stronger, general causes weaker -
unless indeed we consider as a general cause the fact itself of
the inequality of conditions, which allows some individuals
to baffle the natural tendencies of all the rest. The historians
who seek to describe what occurs in democratic societies are
right, therefore, in assigning much to general causes, and in
devoting their chief attention to discover them; but they are

upon nations are lost, it often happens that the world goes
on to move, though the moving agent is no longer discover-
able. As it becomes extremely difficult to discern and to ana-
lyze the reasons which, acting separately on the volition of
each member of the community, concur in the end to pro-
duce movement in the old mass, men are led to believe that
this movement is involuntary, and that societies uncon-
sciously obey some superior force ruling over them. But even
when the general fact which governs the private volition of
all individuals is supposed to be discovered upon the earth,
the principle of human free-will is not secure. A cause suffi-
ciently extensive to affect millions of men at once, and suffi-
ciently strong to bend them all together in the same direc-
tion, may well seem irresistible: having seen that mankind
do yield to it, the mind is close upon the inference that man-
kind cannot resist it.
Historians who live in democratic ages, then, not only deny
that the few have any power of acting upon the destiny of a
people, but they deprive the people themselves of the power
of modifying their own condition, and they subject them
either to an inflexible Providence, or to some blind neces-

sity. According to them, each nation is indissolubly bound
by its position, its origin, its precedents, and its character, to
a certain lot which no efforts can ever change. They involve
generation in generation, and thus, going back from age to
age, and from necessity to necessity, up to the origin of the
world, they forge a close and enormous chain, which girds
and binds the human race. To their minds it is not enough
to show what events have occurred: they would fain show
that events could not have occurred otherwise. They take a
nation arrived at a certain stage of its history, and they af-
firm that it could not but follow the track which brought it
thither. It is easier to make such an assertion than to show by
what means the nation might have adopted a better course.
In reading the historians of aristocratic ages, and especially
those of antiquity, it would seem that, to be master of his lot,
and to govern his fellow-creatures, man requires only to be mas-
ter of himself. In perusing the historical volumes which our age
has produced, it would seem that man is utterly powerless over
himself and over all around him. The historians of antiquity
taught how to command: those of our time teach only how to
obey; in their writings the author often appears great, but hu-

manity is always diminutive. If this doctrine of necessity, which
is so attractive to those who write history in democratic ages,
passes from authors to their readers, till it infects the whole
mass of the community and gets possession of the public mind,
it will soon paralyze the activity of modern society, and reduce
Christians to the level of the Turks. I would moreover observe,
that such principles are peculiarly dangerous at the period at
which we are arrived. Our contemporaries are but too prone
to doubt of the human free-will, because each of them feels
himself confined on every side by his own weakness; but they
are still willing to acknowledge the strength and independence
of men united in society. Let not this principle be lost sight of;
for the great object in our time is to raise the faculties of men,
not to complete their prostration.

Chapter XXI: Of Parliamentary Eloquence in
The United States

Amongst aristocratic nations all the members of the com-
munity are connected with and dependent upon each other;
the graduated scale of different ranks acts as a tie, which

men act or speak, hardly ever reaches the extent of making
them keep silence.
Amongst aristocratic nations the members of political as-
semblies are at the same time members of the aristocracy.
Each of them enjoys high established rank in his own right,
and the position which he occupies in the assembly is often
less important in his eyes than that which he fills in the coun-
try. This consoles him for playing no part in the discussion
of public affairs, and restrains him from too eagerly attempt-
ing to play an insignificant one.
In America, it generally happens that a Representative only
becomes somebody from his position in the Assembly. He is
therefore perpetually haunted by a craving to acquire impor-
tance there, and he feels a petulant desire to be constantly
obtruding his opinions upon the House. His own vanity is
not the only stimulant which urges him on in this course,
but that of his constituents, and the continual necessity of
propitiating them. Amongst aristocratic nations a member
of the legislature is rarely in strict dependence upon his con-
stituents: he is frequently to them a sort of unavoidable rep-
resentative; sometimes they are themselves strictly dependent

sponding to the rank they have conferred upon him.
Independently of his position as a legislator of the State,
electors also regard their Representative as the natural pa-
tron of the constituency in the Legislature; they almost con-
sider him as the proxy of each of his supporters, and they
flatter themselves that he will not be less zealous in defense
of their private interests than of those of the country. Thus
electors are well assured beforehand that the Representative
of their choice will be an orator; that he will speak often if he
can, and that in case he is forced to refrain, he will strive at
any rate to compress into his less frequent orations an in-
quiry into all the great questions of state, combined with a
statement of all the petty grievances they have themselves to
complain to; so that, though he be not able to come forward
frequently, he should on each occasion prove what he is ca-
pable of doing; and that, instead of perpetually lavishing his
powers, he should occasionally condense them in a small
compass, so as to furnish a sort of complete and brilliant
epitome of his constituents and of himself. On these terms
they will vote for him at the next election. These conditions
drive worthy men of humble abilities to despair, who, know-

ing their own powers, would never voluntarily have come
forward. But thus urged on, the Representative begins to
speak, to the great alarm of his friends; and rushing impru-
dently into the midst of the most celebrated orators, he per-
plexes the debate and wearies the House.
All laws which tend to make the Representative more de-
pendent on the elector, not only affect the conduct of the
legislators, as I have remarked elsewhere, but also their lan-
guage. They exercise a simultaneous influence on affairs them-
selves, and on the manner in which affairs are discussed.
There is hardly a member of Congress who can make up
his mind to go home without having despatched at least one
speech to his constituents; nor who will endure any inter-
ruption until he has introduced into his harangue whatever
useful suggestions may be made touching the four-and-
twenty States of which the Union is composed, and espe-
cially the district which he represents. He therefore presents
to the mind of his auditors a succession of great general truths
(which he himself only comprehends, and expresses, con-
fusedly), and of petty minutia, which he is but too able to
discover and to point out. The consequence is that the de-

question under discussion. Hence the political debates of a
democratic people, however small it may be, have a degree
of breadth which frequently renders them attractive to man-
kind. All men are interested by them, because they treat of
man, who is everywhere the same. Amongst the greatest aris-
tocratic nations, on the contrary, the most general questions
are almost always argued on some special grounds derived
from the practice of a particular time, or the rights of a par-
ticular class; which interest that class alone, or at most the
people amongst whom that class happens to exist. It is ow-
ing to this, as much as to the greatness of the French people,
and the favorable disposition of the nations who listen to
them, that the great effect which the French political de-
bates sometimes produce in the world, must be attributed.
The orators of France frequently speak to mankind, even
when they are addressing their countrymen only.

More Ardent and Enduring Love of Equality
Than of Liberty

The first and most intense passion which is engendered by the
equality of conditions is, I need hardly say, the love of that
same equality. My readers will therefore not be surprised that
I speak of its before all others. Everybody has remarked that in
our time, and especially in France, this passion for equality is
every day gaining ground in the human heart. It has been said
a hundred times that our contemporaries are far more ardently
and tenaciously attached to equality than to freedom; but as I
do not find that the causes of the fact have been sufficiently
analyzed, I shall endeavor to point them out.
It is possible to imagine an extreme point at which free-
dom and equality would meet and be confounded together.

not, therefore, form the distinguishing characteristic of demo-
cratic ages. The peculiar and preponderating fact which marks
those ages as its own is the equality of conditions; the ruling
passion of men in those periods is the love of this equality.
Ask not what singular charm the men of democratic ages
find in being equal, or what special reasons they may have
for clinging so tenaciously to equality rather than to the other
advantages which society holds out to them: equality is the
distinguishing characteristic of the age they live in; that, of
itself, is enough to explain that they prefer it to all the rest.
But independently of this reason there are several others,
which will at all times habitually lead men to prefer equality
to freedom. If a people could ever succeed in destroying, or
even in diminishing, the equality which prevails in its own
body, this could only be accomplished by long and labori-
ous efforts. Its social condition must be modified, its laws
abolished, its opinions superseded, its habits changed, its
manners corrupted. But political liberty is more easily lost;
to neglect to hold it fast is to allow it to escape. Men there-
fore not only cling to equality because it is dear to them;
they also adhere to it because they think it will last forever.

That political freedom may compromise in its excesses the
tranquillity, the property, the lives of individuals, is obvious
to the narrowest and most unthinking minds. But, on the
contrary, none but attentive and clear-sighted men perceive
the perils with which equality threatens us, and they com-
monly avoid pointing them out. They know that the calami-
ties they apprehend are remote, and flatter themselves that
they will only fall upon future generations, for which the
present generation takes but little thought. The evils which
freedom sometimes brings with it are immediate; they are
apparent to all, and all are more or less affected by them.
The evils which extreme equality may produce are slowly
disclosed; they creep gradually into the social frame; they are
only seen at intervals, and at the moment at which they be-
come most violent habit already causes them to be no longer
felt. The advantages which freedom brings are only shown
by length of time; and it is always easy to mistake the cause
in which they originate. The advantages of equality are in-
stantaneous, and they may constantly be traced from their
source. Political liberty bestows exalted pleasures, from time
to time, upon a certain number of citizens. Equality every

they risk their dearest interests: they are deaf. Show them

not freedom escaping from their grasp, whilst they are look-

ing another way: they are blind – or rather, they can discern

but one sole object to be desired in the universe.

What I have said is applicable to all democratic nations:

what I am about to say concerns the French alone. Amongst

most modern nations, and especially amongst all those of

the Continent of Europe, the taste and the idea of freedom

only began to exist and to extend themselves at the time

when social conditions were tending to equality, and as a

consequence of that very equality. Absolute kings were the

most efficient levellers of ranks amongst their subjects.

Amongst these nations equality preceded freedom: equality

was therefore a fact of some standing when freedom was still

a novelty: the one had already created customs, opinions,

and laws belonging to it, when the other, alone and for the

first time, came into actual existence. Thus the latter was

still only an affair of opinion and of taste, whilst the former

had already crept into the habits of the people, possessed

itself of their manners, and given a particular turn to the

smallest actions of their lives. Can it be wondered that the

men of our own time prefer the one to the other?

I think that democratic communities have a natural taste

for freedom: left to themselves, they will seek it, cherish it,

and view any privation of it with regret. But for equality,

their passion is ardent, insatiable, incessant, invincible: they

call for equality in freedom; and if they cannot obtain that,

they still call for equality in slavery. They will endure pov-

erty, servitude, barbarism – but they will not endure aristoc-

racy. This is true at all times, and especially true in our own.

All men and all powers seeking to cope with this irresistible

passion, will be overthrown and destroyed by it. In our age,

freedom cannot be established without it, and despotism it-

self cannot reign without its support.

Chapter II: Of Individualism in Democratic
Countries

I have shown how it is that in ages of equality every man

seeks for his opinions within himself: I am now about to

show how it is that, in the same ages, all his feelings are

turned towards himselfalone. Individualism* is a novel ex-

pression, to which a novel idea has given birth. Our fathers
were only acquainted with egotism. Egotism is a passionate
and exaggerated love of self, which leads a man to connect
everything with his own person, and to prefer himself to
everything in the world. Individualism is a mature and calm
feeling, which disposes each member of the community to
sever himself from the mass of his fellow-creatures; and to
draw apart with his family and his friends; so that, after he
has thus formed a little circle of his own, he willingly leaves
society at large to itself. Egotism originates in blind instinct:
individualism proceeds from erroneous judgment more than
from depraved feelings; it originates as much in the deficien-
cies of the mind as in the perversity of the heart. Egotism
blights the germ of all virtue; individualism, at first, only

*[I adopt the expression of the original, however strange it
may seem to the English ear, partly because it illustrates the
remark on the introduction of general terms into democratic
language which was made in a preceding chapter, and partly
because I know of no English word exactly equivalent to the
expression. The chapter itself defines the meaning attached
to it by the author. — Translator’s Note.]

one above the other, the result is that each of them always
sees a man above himself whose patronage is necessary to
him, and below himself another man whose co-operation he
may claim. Men living in aristocratic ages are therefore al-
most always closely attached to something placed out of their
own sphere, and they are often disposed to forget themselves.
It is true that in those ages the notion of human fellowship is
faint, and that men seldom think of sacrificing themselves
for mankind; but they often sacrifice themselves for other
men. In democratic ages, on the contrary, when the duties
of each individual to the race are much more clear, devoted
service to any one man becomes more rare; the bond of hu-
man affection is extended, but it is relaxed.
Amongst democratic nations new families are constantly
springing up, others are constantly falling away, and all that
remain change their condition; the woof of time is every
instant broken, and the track of generations effaced. Those
who went before are soon forgotten; of those who will come
after no one has any idea: the interest of man is confined to
those in close propinquity to himself. As each class approxi-
mates to other classes, and intermingles with them, its mem-

bers become indifferent and as strangers to one another. Ar-
istocracy had made a chain of all the members of the com-
munity, from the peasant to the king: democracy breaks that
chain, and severs every link of it. As social conditions be-
come more equal, the number of persons increases who, al-
though they are neither rich enough nor powerful enough to
exercise any great influence over their fellow-creatures, have
nevertheless acquired or retained sufficient education and
fortune to satisfy their own wants. They owe nothing to any
man, they expect nothing from any man; they acquire the
habit of always considering themselves as standing alone, and
they are apt to imagine that their whole destiny is in their
own hands. Thus not only does democracy make every man
forget his ancestors, but it hides his descendants, and sepa-
rates his contemporaries from him; it throws him back for-
ever upon himself alone, and threatens in the end to confine
him entirely within the solitude of his own heart.

Chapter III: Individualism Stronger at the Close
of a Democratic Revolution Than at Other
Periods

The period when the construction of democratic society upon
the ruins of an aristocracy has just been completed, is espe-
cially that at which this separation of men from one another,
and the egotism resulting from it, most forcibly strike the
observation. Democratic communities not only contain a
large number of independent citizens, but they are constantly
filled with men who, having entered but yesterday upon their
independent condition, are intoxicated with their new power.
They entertain a presumptuous confidence in their strength,
and as they do not suppose that they can henceforward ever
have occasion to claim the assistance of their fellow-crea-
tures, they do not scruple to show that they care for nobody
but themselves.
An aristocracy seldom yields without a protracted struggle,
in the course of which implacable animosities are kindled
between the different classes of society. These passions sur-
vive the victory, and traces of them may be observed in the

which the state of inequality engendered. The great advan-
tage of the Americans is that they have arrived at a state of
democracy without having to endure a democratic revolu-
tion; and that they are born equal, instead of becoming so.

Chapter IV: That the Americans Combat the
Effects of Individualism by Free Institutions

Despotism, which is of a very timorous nature, is never more
secure of continuance than when it can keep men asunder;
and all is influence is commonly exerted for that purpose.
No vice of the human heart is so acceptable to it as egotism:
a despot easily forgives his subjects for not loving him, pro-
vided they do not love each other. He does not ask them to
assist him in governing the State; it is enough that they do
not aspire to govern it themselves. He stigmatizes as turbu-
lent and unruly spirits those who would combine their exer-
tions to promote the prosperity of the community, and, per-
verting the natural meaning of words, he applauds as good
citizens those who have no sympathy for any but themselves.
Thus the vices which despotism engenders are precisely those

which equality fosters. These two things mutually and per-
niciously complete and assist each other. Equality places men
side by side, unconnected by any common tie; despotism
raises barriers to keep them asunder; the former predisposes
them not to consider their fellow-creatures, the latter makes
general indifference a sort of public virtue.
Despotism then, which is at all times dangerous, is more
particularly to be feared in democratic ages. It is easy to see
that in those same ages men stand most in need of free-
dom. When the members of a community are forced to
attend to public affairs, they are necessarily drawn from
the circle of their own interests, and snatched at times from
self-observation. As soon as a man begins to treat of public
affairs in public, he begins to perceive that he is not so
independent of his fellow-men as he had at first imagined,
and that, in order to obtain their support, he must often
lend them his co-operation.
When the public is supreme, there is no man who does
not feel the value of public goodwill, or who does not en-
deavor to court it by drawing to himself the esteem and af-
fection of those amongst whom he is to live. Many of the

Chapter V: Of the Use Which the Americans
Make of Public Associations in Civil Life

I do not propose to speak of those political associations -by
the aid of which men endeavor to defend themselves against
the despotic influence of a majority - or against the aggres-
sions of regal power. That subject I have already treated. If
each citizen did not learn, in proportion as he individually
becomes more feeble, and consequently more incapable of
preserving his freedom single-handed, to combine with his
fellow-citizens for the purpose of defending it, it is clear that
tyranny would unavoidably increase together with equality.
Those associations only which are formed in civil life, with-
out reference to political objects, are here adverted to. The
political associations which exist in the United States are only
a single feature in the midst of the immense assemblage of
associations in that country. Americans of all ages, all condi-
tions, and all dispositions, constantly form associations. They
have not only commercial and manufacturing companies,

in which all take part, but associations of a thousand other
kinds -religious, moral, serious, futile, extensive, or restricted,
enormous or diminutive. The Americans make associations
to give entertainments, to found establishments for educa-
tion, to build inns, to construct churches, to diffuse books,
to send missionaries to the antipodes; and in this manner
they found hospitals, prisons, and schools. If it be proposed
to advance some truth, or to foster some feeling by the en-
couragement of a great example, they form a society. Wher-
ever, at the head of some new undertaking, you see the gov-
ernment in France, or a man of rank in England, in the United
States you will be sure to find an association. I met with
several kinds of associations in America, of which I confess I
had no previous notion; and I have often admired the ex-
treme skill with which the inhabitants of the United States
succeed in proposing a common object to the exertions of a
great many men, and in getting them voluntarily to pursue
it. I have since travelled over England, whence the Ameri-
cans have taken some of their laws and many of their cus-
toms; and it seemed to me that the principle of association
was by no means so constantly or so adroitly used in that

association are limited in number, they may easily become
mutually acquainted, understand each other, and establish
fixed regulations. The same opportunities do not occur
amongst democratic nations, where the associated members
must always be very numerous for their association to have
any power.
I am aware that many of my countrymen are not in the
least embarrassed by this difficulty. They contend that the
more enfeebled and incompetent the citizens become, the
more able and active the government ought to be rendered,
in order that society at large may execute what individuals
can no longer accomplish. They believe this answers the whole
difficulty, but I think they are mistaken. A government might
perform the part of some of the largest American compa-
nies; and several States, members of the Union, have already
attempted it; but what political power could ever carry on
the vast multitude of lesser undertakings which the Ameri-
can citizens perform every day, with the assistance of the
principle of association? It is easy to foresee that the time is
drawing near when man will be less and less able to produce,
of himself alone, the commonest necessaries of life. The task

can only be accomplished by associations.
When the members of an aristocratic community adopt a
new opinion, or conceive a new sentiment, they give it a
station, as it were, beside themselves, upon the lofty plat-
form where they stand; and opinions or sentiments so con-
spicuous to the eyes of the multitude are easily introduced
into the minds or hearts of all around. In democratic coun-
tries the governing power alone is naturally in a condition to
act in this manner; but it is easy to see that its action is al-
ways inadequate, and often dangerous. A government can
no more be competent to keep alive and to renew the circu-
lation of opinions and feelings amongst a great people, than
to manage all the speculations of productive industry. No
sooner does a government attempt to go beyond its political
sphere and to enter upon this new track, than it exercises,
even unintentionally, an insupportable tyranny; for a gov-
ernment can only dictate strict rules, the opinions which it
favors are rigidly enforced, and it is never easy to discrimi-
nate between its advice and its commands. Worse still will
be the case if the government really believes itself interested
in preventing all circulation of ideas; it will then stand mo-

tionless, and oppressed by the heaviness of voluntary torpor.
Governments therefore should not be the only active pow-
ers: associations ought, in democratic nations, to stand in
lieu of those powerful private individuals whom the equality
of conditions has swept away.
As soon as several of the inhabitants of the United States
have taken up an opinion or a feeling which they wish to
promote in the world, they look out for mutual assistance;
and as soon as they have found each other out, they com-
bine. From that moment they are no longer isolated men,
but a power seen from afar, whose actions serve for an ex-
ample, and whose language is listened to. The first time I
heard in the United States that 100,000 men had bound
themselves publicly to abstain from spirituous liquors, it
appeared to me more like a joke than a serious engagement;
and I did not at once perceive why these temperate citizens
could not content themselves with drinking water by their
own firesides. I at last understood that 300,000 Americans,
alarmed by the progress of drunkenness around them, had
made up their minds to patronize temperance. They acted
just in the same way as a man of high rank who should dress

very plainly, in order to inspire the humbler orders with a
contempt of luxury. It is probable that if these 100,000 men
had lived in France, each of them would singly have memo-
rialized the government to watch the publichouses all over
the kingdom.
Nothing, in my opinion, is more deserving of our atten-
tion than the intellectual and moral associations of America.
The political and industrial associations of that country strike
us forcibly; but the others elude our observation, or if we
discover them, we understand them imperfectly, because we
have hardly ever seen anything of the kind. It must, how-
ever, be acknowledged that they are as necessary to the Ameri-
can people as the former, and perhaps more so. In demo-
cratic countries the science of association is the mother of
science; the progress of all the rest depends upon the progress
it has made. Amongst the laws which rule human societies
there is one which seems to be more precise and clear than
all others. If men are to remain civilized, or to become so,
the art of associating together must grow and improve in the
same ratio in which the equality of conditions is increased.

Chapter VI: Of the Relation Between Public
Associations and Newspapers

When men are no longer united amongst themselves by firm
and lasting ties, it is impossible to obtain the cooperation of
any great number of them, unless you can persuade every
man whose concurrence you require that this private inter-
est obliges him voluntarily to unite his exertions to the exer-
tions of all the rest. This can only be habitually and conve-
niently effected by means of a newspaper; nothing but a news-
paper can drop the same thought into a thousand minds at
the same moment. A newspaper is an adviser who does not
require to be sought, but who comes of his own accord, and
talks to you briefly every day of the common weal, without
distracting you from your private affairs.
Newspapers therefore become more necessary in propor-
tion as men become more equal, and individualism more to
be feared. To suppose that they only serve to protect free-
dom would be to diminish their importance: they maintain
civilization. I shall not deny that in democratic countries
newspapers frequently lead the citizens to launch together in

association amongst a democratic people should have any
power, it must be a numerous body. The persons of whom it
is composed are therefore scattered over a wide extent, and
each of them is detained in the place of his domicile by the
narrowness of his income, or by the small unremitting exer-
tions by which he earns it. Means then must be found to
converse every day without seeing each other, and to take
steps in common without having met. Thus hardly any demo-
cratic association can do without newspapers. There is con-
sequently a necessary connection between public associations
and newspapers: newspapers make associations, and associa-
tions make newspapers; and if it has been correctly advanced
that associations will increase in number as the conditions of
men become more equal, it is not less certain that the num-
ber of newspapers increases in proportion to that of associa-
tions. Thus it is in America that we find at the same time the
greatest number of associations and of newspapers.
This connection between the number of newspapers and
that of associations leads us to the discovery of a further con-
nection between the state of the periodical press and the form
of the administration in a country; and shows that the num-

ber of newspapers must diminish or increase amongst a demo-
cratic people, in proportion as its administration is more or
less centralized. For amongst democratic nations the exer-
cise of local powers cannot be intrusted to the principal mem-
bers of the community as in aristocracies. Those powers must
either be abolished, or placed in the hands of very large num-
bers of men, who then in fact constitute an association per-
manently established by law for the purpose of administer-
ing the affairs of a certain extent of territory; and they re-
quire a journal, to bring to them every day, in the midst of
their own minor concerns, some intelligence of the state of
their public weal. The more numerous local powers are, the
greater is the number of men in whom they are vested by
law; and as this want is hourly felt, the more profusely do
newspapers abound.
The extraordinary subdivision of administrative power has
much more to do with the enormous number of American
newspapers than the great political freedom of the country
and the absolute liberty of the press. If all the inhabitants of
the Union had the suffrage - but a suffrage which should
only extend to the choice of their legislators in Congress -

they would require but few newspapers, because they would
only have to act together on a few very important but very
rare occasions. But within the pale of the great association of
the nation, lesser associations have been established by law
in every country, every city, and indeed in every village, for
the purposes of local administration. The laws of the coun-
try thus compel every American to co-operate every day of
his life with some of his fellow-citizens for a common pur-
pose, and each one of them requires a newspaper to inform
him what all the others are doing.
I am of opinion that a democratic people,* without any
national representative assemblies, but with a great number
of small local powers, would have in the end more newspa-
pers than another people governed by a centralized adminis-
tration and an elective legislation. What best explains to me
the enormous circulation of the daily press in the United
States, is that amongst the Americans I find the utmost na-
*I say a democratic people: the administration of an aristo-
cratic people may be the reverse of centralized, and yet the
want of newspapers be little felt, because local powers are
then vested in the hands of a very small number of men,
who either act apart, or who know each other and can easily
meet and come to an understanding.

tional freedom combined with local freedom of every kind.
There is a prevailing opinion in France and England that the
circulation of newspapers would be indefinitely increased by
removing the taxes which have been laid upon the press. This
is a very exaggerated estimate of the effects of such a reform.
Newspapers increase in numbers, not according to their
cheapness, but according to the more or less frequent want
which a great number of men may feel for intercommunica-
tion and combination.
In like manner I should attribute the increasing influence
of the daily press to causes more general than those by which
it is commonly explained. A newspaper can only subsist on
the condition of publishing sentiments or principles com-
mon to a large number of men. A newspaper therefore al-
ways represents an association which is composed of its ha-
bitual readers. This association may be more or less defined,
more or less restricted, more or less numerous; but the fact
that the newspaper keeps alive, is a proof that at least the
germ of such an association exists in the minds of its readers.
This leads me to a last reflection, with which I shall con-
clude this chapter. The more equal the conditions of men

become, and the less strong men individually are, the more
easily do they give way to the current of the multitude, and
the more difficult is it for them to adhere by themselves to
an opinion which the multitude discard. A newspaper repre-
sents an association; it may be said to address each of its
readers in the name of all the others, and to exert its influ-
ence over them in proportion to their individual weakness.
The power of the newspaper press must therefore increase as
the social conditions of men become more equal.

Chapter VII: Connection of Civil and Political
Associations

There is only one country on the face of the earth where the
citizens enjoy unlimited freedom of association for political
purposes. This same country is the only one in the world
where the continual exercise of the right of association has
been introduced into civil life, and where all the advantages
which civilization can confer are procured by means of it. In
all the countries where political associations are prohibited,
civil associations are rare. It is hardly probable that this is the

result of accident; but the inference should rather be, that
there is a natural, and perhaps a necessary, connection be-
tween these two kinds of associations. Certain men happen
to have a common interest in some concern – either a com-
mercial undertaking is to be managed, or some speculation
in manufactures to be tried; they meet, they combine, and
thus by degrees they become familiar with the principle of
association. The greater is the multiplicity of small affairs,
the more do men, even without knowing it, acquire facility
in prosecuting great undertakings in common. Civil associa-
tions, therefore, facilitate political association: but, on the
other hand, political association singularly strengthens and
improves associations for civil purposes. In civil life every
man may, strictly speaking, fancy that he can provide for his
own wants; in politics, he can fancy no such thing. When a
people, then, have any knowledge of public life, the notion
of association, and the wish to coalesce, present themselves
every day to the minds of the whole community: whatever
natural repugnance may restrain men from acting in con-
cert, they will always be ready to combine for the sake of a
party. Thus political life makes the love and practice of asso-

not less necessary to know in civil than in political associa-
tions. Political associations may therefore be considered as large
free schools, where all the members of the community go to
learn the general theory of association.
But even if political association did not directly contribute
to the progress of civil association, to destroy the former
would be to impair the latter. When citizens can only meet
in public for certain purposes, they regard such meetings as
a strange proceeding of rare occurrence, and they rarely think
at all about it. When they are allowed to meet freely for all
purposes, they ultimately look upon public association as
the universal, or in a manner the sole means, which men can
employ to accomplish the different purposes they may have
in view. Every new want instantly revives the notion. The art
of association then becomes, as I have said before, the mother
of action, studied and applied by all.
When some kinds of associations are prohibited and oth-
ers allowed, it is difficult to distinguish the former from the
latter, beforehand. In this state of doubt men abstain from
them altogether, and a sort of public opinion passes current
which tends to cause any association whatsoever to be re-

garded as a bold and almost an illicit enterprise.*
*This is more especially true when the executive government
has a discretionary power of allowing or prohibiting associa-
tions. When certain associations are simply prohibited by
law, and the courts of justice have to punish infringements
of that law, the evil is far less considerable. Then every citi-
zen knows beforehand pretty nearly what he has to expect.
He judges himself before he is judged by the law, and, ab-
staining from prohibited associations, he embarks in those
which are legally sanctioned. It is by these restrictions that
all free nations have always admitted that the right of asso-
ciation might be limited. But if the legislature should invest
a man with a power of ascertaining beforehand which asso-
ciations are dangerous and which are useful, and should au-
thorize him to destroy all associations in the bud or allow
them to be formed, as nobody would be able to foresee in
what cases associations might be established and in what cases
they would be put down, the spirit of association would be
entirely paralyzed. The former of these laws would only as-
sail certain associations; the latter would apply to society it-
self, and inflict an injury upon it. I can conceive that a regu-
lar government may have recourse to the former, but I do
not concede that any government has the right of enacting
the latter.

unskillfully managed, that they will never form any vast de-
signs, or that they will fail in the execution of them.
This naturally leads me to think that freedom of associa-
tion in political matters is not so dangerous to public tran-
quillity as is supposed; and that possibly, after having agi-
tated society for some time, it may strengthen the State in
the end. In democratic countries political associations are,
so to speak, the only powerful persons who aspire to rule the
State. Accordingly, the governments of our time look upon
associations of this kind just as sovereigns in the Middle Ages
regarded the great vassals of the Crown: they entertain a sort
of instinctive abhorrence of them, and they combat them on
all occasions. They bear, on the contrary, a natural goodwill
to civil associations, because they readily discover that, in-
stead of directing the minds of the community to public
affairs, these institutions serve to divert them from such re-
flections; and that, by engaging them more and more in the
pursuit of objects which cannot be attained without public
tranquillity, they deter them from revolutions. But these gov-
ernments do not attend to the fact that political associations
tend amazingly to multiply and facilitate those of a civil char-

acter, and that in avoiding a dangerous evil they deprive them-
selves of an efficacious remedy.
When you see the Americans freely and constantly form-
ing associations for the purpose of promoting some political
principle, of raising one man to the head of affairs, or of
wresting power from another, you have some difficulty in
understanding that men so independent do not constantly
fall into the abuse of freedom. If, on the other hand, you
survey the infinite number of trading companies which are
in operation in the United States, and perceive that the
Americans are on every side unceasingly engaged in the ex-
ecution of important and difficult plans, which the slightest
revolution would throw into confusion, you will readily com-
prehend why people so well employed are by no means
tempted to perturb the State, nor to destroy that public tran-
quillity by which they all profit.
Is it enough to observe these things separately, or should
we not discover the hidden tie which connects them? In their
political associations, the Americans of all conditions, minds,
and ages, daily acquire a general taste for association, and
grow accustomed to the use of it. There they meet together

“It cannot be denied that the unrestrained liberty of associa-
tion for political purposes is the last degree of liberty which
a people is fit for. If it does not throw them into anarchy, it
perpetually brings them, as it were, to the verge of it.” Thus
I do not think that a nation is always at liberty to invest its
citizens with an absolute right of association for political pur-
poses; and I doubt whether, in any country or in any age, it
be wise to set no limits to freedom of association. A certain
nation, it is said, could not maintain tranquillity in the com-
munity, cause the laws to be respected, or establish a lasting
government, if the right of association were not confined
within narrow limits. These blessings are doubtless invalu-
able, and I can imagine that, to acquire or to preserve them,
a nation may impose upon itself severe temporary restric-
tions: but still it is well that the nation should know at what
price these blessings are purchased. I can understand that it
may be advisable to cut off a man’s arm in order to save his
life; but it would be ridiculous to assert that he will be as
dexterous as he was before he lost it.

Chapter VIII: The Americans Combat Individual-
ism by the Principle of Interest Rightly Understood

When the world was managed by a few rich and powerful
individuals, these persons loved to entertain a lofty idea of
the duties of man. They were fond of professing that it is
praiseworthy to forget one’s self, and that good should be
done without hope of reward, as it is by the Deity himself.
Such were the standard opinions of that time in morals. I
doubt whether men were more virtuous in aristocratic ages
than in others; but they were incessantly talking of the beau-
ties of virtue, and its utility was only studied in secret. But
since the imagination takes less lofty flights and every man’s
thoughts are centred in himself, moralists are alarmed by
this idea of self-sacrifice, and they no longer venture to present
it to the human mind. They therefore content themselves
with inquiring whether the personal advantage of each mem-
ber of the community does not consist in working for the
good of all; and when they have hit upon some point on

which private interest and public interest meet and amal-
gamate, they are eager to bring it into notice. Observations
of this kind are gradually multiplied: what was only a single
remark becomes a general principle; and it is held as a truth
that man serves himself in serving his fellow-creatures, and
that his private interest is to do good.
I have already shown, in several parts of this work, by what
means the inhabitants of the United States almost always
manage to combine their own advantage with that of their
fellow-citizens: my present purpose is to point out the gen-
eral rule which enables them to do so. In the United States
hardly anybody talks of the beauty of virtue; but they main-
tain that virtue is useful, and prove it every day. The Ameri-
can moralists do not profess that men ought to sacrifice them-
selves for their fellow-creatures because it is noble to make
such sacrifices; but they boldly aver that such sacrifices are as
necessary to him who imposes them upon himself as to him
for whose sake they are made. They have found out that in
their country and their age man is brought home to himself
by an irresistible force; and losing all hope of stopping that
force, they turn all their thoughts to the direction of it. They

therefore do not deny that every man may follow his own
interest; but they endeavor to prove that it is the interest of
every man to be virtuous. I shall not here enter into the rea-
sons they allege, which would divert me from my subject:
suffice it to say that they have convinced their fellow-coun-
trymen.
Montaigne said long ago: “Were I not to follow the straight
road for its straightness, I should follow it for having found
by experience that in the end it is commonly the happiest
and most useful track.” The doctrine of interest rightly un-
derstood is not, then, new, but amongst the Americans of
our time it finds universal acceptance: it has become popular
there; you may trace it at the bottom of all their actions, you
will remark it in all they say. It is as often to be met with on
the lips of the poor man as of the rich. In Europe the prin-
ciple of interest is much grosser than it is in America, but at
the same time it is less common, and especially it is less
avowed; amongst us, men still constantly feign great abne-
gation which they no longer feel. The Americans, on the
contrary, are fond of explaining almost all the actions of their
lives by the principle of interest rightly understood; they show

it easily obtains great dominion; nor is that dominion pre-
carious, since the principle checks one personal interest by
another, and uses, to direct the passions, the very same in-
strument which excites them. The principle of interest rightly
understood produces no great acts of self-sacrifice, but it sug-
gests daily small acts of self-denial. By itself it cannot suffice
to make a man virtuous, but it disciplines a number of citi-
zens in habits of regularity, temperance, moderation, fore-
sight, self-command; and, if it does not lead men straight to
virtue by the will, it gradually draws them in that direction
by their habits. If the principle of interest rightly understood
were to sway the whole moral world, extraordinary virtues
would doubtless be more rare; but I think that gross deprav-
ity would then also be less common. The principle of inter-
est rightly understood perhaps prevents some men from ris-
ing far above the level of mankind; but a great number of
other men, who were falling far below it, are caught and
restrained by it. Observe some few individuals, they are low-
ered by it; survey mankind, it is raised. I am not afraid to say
that the principle of interest, rightly understood, appears to
me the best suited of all philosophical theories to the wants

a community, as they become more equal, become more ig-
norant and coarse, it is difficult to foresee to what pitch of
stupid excesses their egotism may lead them; and no one can
foretell into what disgrace and wretchedness they would
plunge themselves, lest they should have to sacrifice some-
thing of their own well-being to the prosperity of their fel-
low-creatures. I do not think that the system of interest, as it
is professed in America, is, in all its parts, self-evident; but it
contains a great number of truths so evident that men, if
they are but educated, cannot fail to see them. Educate, then,
at any rate; for the age of implicit self-sacrifice and instinc-
tive virtues is already flitting far away from us, and the time
is fast approaching when freedom, public peace, and social
order itself will not be able to exist without education.

Chapter IX: That the Americans Apply the
Principle of Interest Rightly Understood to
Religious Matters

If the principle of interest rightly understood had nothing
but the present world in view, it would be very insufficient;

for there are many sacrifices which can only find their rec-
ompense in another; and whatever ingenuity may be put
forth to demonstrate the utility of virtue, it will never be an
easy task to make that man live aright who has no thoughts
of dying. It is therefore necessary to ascertain whether the
principle of interest rightly understood is easily compatible
with religious belief. The philosophers who inculcate this
system of morals tell men, that to be happy in this life they
must watch their own passions and steadily control their
excess; that lasting happiness can only be secured by renounc-
ing a thousand transient gratifications; and that a man must
perpetually triumph over himself, in order to secure his own
advantage. The founders of almost all religions have held the
same language. The track they point out to man is the same,
only that the goal is more remote; instead of placing in this
world the reward of the sacrifices they impose, they trans-
port it to another. Nevertheless I cannot believe that all those
who practise virtue from religious motives are only actuated
by the hope of a recompense. I have known zealous Chris-
tians who constantly forgot themselves, to work with greater
ardor for the happiness of their fellow-men; and I have heard

them declare that all they did was only to earn the blessings
of a future state. I cannot but think that they deceive them-
selves; I respect them too much to believe them.
Christianity indeed teaches that a man must prefer his
neighbor to himself, in order to gain eternal life; but Chris-
tianity also teaches that men ought to benefit their fellow-
creatures for the love of God. A sublime expression! Man,
searching by his intellect into the divine conception, and
seeing that order is the purpose of God, freely combines to
prosecute the great design; and whilst he sacrifices his per-
sonal interests to this consummate order of all created things,
expects no other recompense than the pleasure of contem-
plating it. I do not believe that interest is the sole motive of
religious men: but I believe that interest is the principal means
which religions themselves employ to govern men, and I do
not question that this way they strike into the multitude and
become popular. It is not easy clearly to perceive why the
principle of interest rightly understood should keep aloof
from religious opinions; and it seems to me more easy to
show why it should draw men to them. Let it be supposed
that, in order to obtain happiness in this world, a man com-

ally is, even in their zeal, something so indescribably tranquil,
methodical, and deliberate, that it would seem as if the head,
far more than the heart, brought them to the foot of the altar.
The Americans not only follow their religion from interest,
but they often place in this world the interest which makes
them follow it. In the Middle Ages the clergy spoke of noth-
ing but a future state; they hardly cared to prove that a sincere
Christian may be a happy man here below. But the American
preachers are constantly referring to the earth; and it is only
with great difficulty that they can divert their attention from
it. To touch their congregations, they always show them how
favorable religious opinions are to freedom and public tran-
quillity; and it is often difficult to ascertain from their dis-
courses whether the principal object of religion is to procure
eternal felicity in the other world, or prosperity in this.

Chapter X: Of the Taste for Physical Well-Being
in America

In America the passion for physical well-being is not always
exclusive, but it is general; and if all do not feel it in the same

manner, yet it is felt by all. Carefully to satisfy all, even the
least wants of the body, and to provide the little conveniences
of life, is uppermost in every mind. Something of an analo-
gous character is more and more apparent in Europe.
Amongst the causes which produce these similar conse-
quences in both hemispheres, several are so connected with
my subject as to deserve notice.
When riches are hereditarily fixed in families, there are a
great number of men who enjoy the comforts of life without
feeling an exclusive taste for those comforts. The heart of
man is not so much caught by the undisturbed possession of
anything valuable as by the desire, as yet imperfectly satis-
fied, of possessing it, and by the incessant dread of losing it.
In aristocratic communities, the wealthy, never having expe-
rienced a condition different from their own, entertain no
fear of changing it; the existence of such conditions hardly
occurs to them. The comforts of life are not to them the end
of life, but simply a way of living; they regard them as exist-
ence itself - enjoyed, but scarcely thought of. As the natural
and instinctive taste which all men feel for being well off is
thus satisfied without trouble and without apprehension, their

faculties are turned elsewhere, and cling to more arduous
and more lofty undertakings, which excite and engross their
minds. Hence it is that, in the midst of physical gratifica-
tions, the members of an aristocracy often display a haughty
contempt of these very enjoyments, and exhibit singular
powers of endurance under the privation of them. All the
revolutions which have ever shaken or destroyed aristocra-
cies, have shown how easily men accustomed to superfluous
luxuries can do without the necessaries of life; whereas men
who have toiled to acquire a competency can hardly live af-
ter they have lost it.
If I turn my observation from the upper to the lower classes,
I find analogous effects produced by opposite causes.
Amongst a nation where aristocracy predominates in soci-
ety, and keeps it stationary, the people in the end get as much
accustomed to poverty as the rich to their opulence. The
latter bestow no anxiety on their physical comforts, because
they enjoy them without an effort; the former do not think
of things which they despair of obtaining, and which they
hardly know enough of to desire them. In communities of
this kind, the imagination of the poor is driven to seek an-

nant taste of the nation; the great current of man’s passions
runs in that channel, and sweeps everything along in its
course.

Chapter XI: Peculiar Effects of the Love of Physi-
cal Gratifications in Democratic Ages

It may be supposed, from what has just been said, that the
love of physical gratifications must constantly urge the Ameri-
cans to irregularities in morals, disturb the peace of families,
and threaten the security of society at large. Such is not the
case: the passion for physical gratifications produces in de-
mocracies effects very different from those which it occa-
sions in aristocratic nations. It sometimes happens that, wea-
ried with public affairs and sated with opulence, amidst the
ruin of religious belief and the decline of the State, the heart
of an aristocracy may by degrees be seduced to the pursuit of
sensual enjoyments only. At other times the power of the
monarch or the weakness of the people, without stripping
the nobility of their fortune, compels them to stand aloof
from the administration of affairs, and whilst the road to

are therefore more intent on providing for their smallest wants
than for their extraordinary enjoyments; they gratify a num-
ber of petty desires, without indulging in any great irregu-
larities of passion: thus they are more apt to become ener-
vated than debauched. The especial taste which the men of
democratic ages entertain for physical enjoyments is not natu-
rally opposed to the principles of public order; nay, it often
stands in need of order that it may be gratified. Nor is it
adverse to regularity of morals, for good morals contribute
to public tranquillity and are favorable to industry. It may
even be frequently combined with a species of religious mo-
rality: men wish to be as well off as they can in this world,
without foregoing their chance of another. Some physical
gratifications cannot be indulged in without crime; from such
they strictly abstain. The enjoyment of others is sanctioned
by religion and morality; to these the heart, the imagination,
and life itself are unreservedly given up; till, in snatching at
these lesser gifts, men lose sight of those more precious pos-
sessions which constitute the glory and the greatness of man-
kind. The reproach I address to the principle of equality, is
not that it leads men away in the pursuit of forbidden enjoy-

ments, but that it absorbs them wholly in quest of those
which are allowed. By these means, a kind of virtuous mate-
rialism may ultimately be established in the world, which
would not corrupt, but enervate the soul, and noiselessly
unbend its springs of action.

Chapter XII: Causes of Fanatical Enthusiasm in
Some Americans

Although the desire of acquiring the good things of this world
is the prevailing passion of the American people, certain
momentary outbreaks occur, when their souls seem suddenly
to burst the bonds of matter by which they are restrained,
and to soar impetuously towards heaven. In all the States of
the Union, but especially in the half-peopled country of the
Far West, wandering preachers may be met with who hawk
about the word of God from place to place. Whole families
– old men, women, and children – cross rough passes and
untrodden wilds, coming from a great distance, to join a
camp- meeting, where they totally forget for several days and
nights, in listening to these discourses, the cares of business

It is not then wonderful if, in the midst of a community
whose thoughts tend earthward, a small number of individu-
als are to be found who turn their looks to heaven. I should
be surprised if mysticism did not soon make some advance
amongst a people solely engaged in promoting its own worldly
welfare. It is said that the deserts of the Thebaid were peopled
by the persecutions of the emperors and the massacres of the
Circus; I should rather say that it was by the luxuries of Rome
and the Epicurean philosophy of Greece. If their social con-
dition, their present circumstances, and their laws did not
confine the minds of the Americans so closely to the pursuit
of worldly welfare, it is probable that they would display
more reserve and more experience whenever their attention
is turned to things immaterial, and that they would check
themselves without difficulty. But they feel imprisoned within
bounds which they will apparently never be allowed to pass.
As soon as they have passed these bounds, their minds know
not where to fix themselves, and they often rush unrestrained
beyond the range of common-sense.

Chapter XIII: Causes of the Restless Spirit of
Americans in the Midst of Their Prosperity

In certain remote corners of the Old World you may still
sometimes stumble upon a small district which seems to have
been forgotten amidst the general tumult, and to have re-
mained stationary whilst everything around it was in mo-
tion. The inhabitants are for the most part extremely igno-
rant and poor; they take no part in the business of the coun-
try, and they are frequently oppressed by the government;
yet their countenances are generally placid, and their spirits
light. In America I saw the freest and most enlightened men,
placed in the happiest circumstances which the world af-
fords: it seemed to me as if a cloud habitually hung upon
their brow, and I thought them serious and almost sad even
in their pleasures. The chief reason of this contrast is that the
former do not think of the ills they endure - the latter are
forever brooding over advantages they do not possess. It is
strange to see with what feverish ardor the Americans pursue
their own welfare; and to watch the vague dread that con-
stantly torments them lest they should not have chosen the

shortest path which may lead to it. A native of the United
States clings to this world’s goods as if he were certain never
to die; and he is so hasty in grasping at all within his reach,
that one would suppose he was constantly afraid of not liv-
ing long enough to enjoy them. He clutches everything, he
holds nothing fast, but soon loosens his grasp to pursue fresh
gratifications.
In the United States a man builds a house to spend his latter
years in it, and he sells it before the roof is on: he plants a
garden, and lets it just as the trees are coming into bearing: he
brings a field into tillage, and leaves other men to gather the
crops: he embraces a profession, and gives it up: he settles in a
place, which he soon afterwards leaves, to carry his change-
able longings elsewhere. If his private affairs leave him any
leisure, he instantly plunges into the vortex of politics; and if
at the end of a year of unremitting labor he finds he has a few
days’ vacation, his eager curiosity whirls him over the vast ex-
tent of the United States, and he will travel fifteen hundred
miles in a few days, to shake off his happiness. Death at length
overtakes him, but it is before he is weary of his bootless chase
of that complete felicity which is forever on the wing.

oftentimes will haunt the inhabitants of democratic coun-
tries in the midst of their abundance, and that disgust at life
which sometimes seizes upon them in the midst of calm and
easy circumstances. Complaints are made in France that the
number of suicides increases; in America suicide is rare, but
insanity is said to be more common than anywhere else. These
are all different symptoms of the same disease. The Ameri-
cans do not put an end to their lives, however disquieted
they may be, because their religion forbids it; and amongst
them materialism may be said hardly to exist, notwithstand-
ing the general passion for physical gratification. The will
resists - reason frequently gives way. In democratic ages en-
joyments are more intense than in the ages of aristocracy,
and especially the number of those who partake in them is
larger: but, on the other hand, it must be admitted that man’s
hopes and his desires are oftener blasted, the soul is more
stricken and perturbed, and care itself more keen.

Book Two – Chapters XIV – XIII

Chapter XIV: Taste for Physical Gratifications
United In America to Love of Freedom and
Attention to Public Affairs

When a democratic state turns to absolute monarchy, the
activity which was before directed to public and to private
affairs is all at once centred upon the latter: the immediate
consequence is, for some time, great physical prosperity; but
this impulse soon slackens, and the amount of productive
industry is checked. I know not if a single trading or manu-
facturing people can be cited, from the Tyrians down to the
Florentines and the English, who were not a free people also.
There is therefore a close bond and necessary relation be-
tween these two elements – freedom and productive indus-
try. This proposition is generally true of all nations, but es-
pecially of democratic nations. I have already shown that
men who live in ages of equality continually require to form
associations in order to procure the things they covet; and,
on the other hand, I have shown how great political freedom

improves and diffuses the art of association. Freedom, in these
ages, is therefore especially favorable to the production of
wealth; nor is it difficult to perceive that despotism is espe-
cially adverse to the same result. The nature of despotic power
in democratic ages is not to be fierce or cruel, but minute
and meddling. Despotism of this kind, though it does not
trample on humanity, is directly opposed to the genius of
commerce and the pursuits of industry.
Thus the men of democratic ages require to be free in or-
der more readily to procure those physical enjoyments for
which they are always longing. It sometimes happens, how-
ever, that the excessive taste they conceive for these same
enjoyments abandons them to the first master who appears.
The passion for worldly welfare then defeats itself, and, with-
out perceiving it, throws the object of their desires to a greater
distance.
There is, indeed, a most dangerous passage in the history
of a democratic people. When the taste for physical gratifi-
cations amongst such a people has grown more rapidly than
their education and their experience of free institutions, the
time will come when men are carried away, and lose all self-

still directs its course. An American attends to his private
concerns as if he were alone in the world, and the next minute
he gives himself up to the common weal as if he had forgot-
ten them. At one time he seems animated by the most selfish
cupidity, at another by the most lively patriotism. The hu-
man heart cannot be thus divided. The inhabitants of the
United States alternately display so strong and so similar a
passion for their own welfare and for their freedom, that it
may be supposed that these passions are united and mingled
in some part of their character. And indeed the Americans
believe their freedom to be the best instrument and surest
safeguard of their welfare: they are attached to the one by
the other. They by no means think that they are not called
upon to take a part in the public weal; they believe, on the
contrary, that their chief business is to secure for themselves
a government which will allow them to acquire the things
they covet, and which will not debar them from the peaceful
enjoyment of those possessions which they have acquired.

Chapter XV: That Religious Belief Sometimes Turns The
Thoughts Of The Americans To Immaterial Pleasures

In the United States, on the seventh day of every week, the
trading and working life of the nation seems suspended; all
noises cease; a deep tranquillity, say rather the solemn calm
of meditation, succeeds the turmoil of the week, and the
soul resumes possession and contemplation of itself. Upon
this day the marts of traffic are deserted; every member of
the community, accompanied by his children, goes to church,
where he listens to strange language which would seem un-
suited to his ear. He is told of the countless evils caused by
pride and covetousness: he is reminded of the necessity of
checking his desires, of the finer pleasures which belong to
virtue alone, and of the true happiness which attends it. On
his return home, he does not turn to the ledgers of his call-
ing, but he opens the book of Holy Scripture; there he meets
with sublime or affecting descriptions of the greatness and
goodness of the Creator, of the infinite magnificence of the
handiwork of God, of the lofty destinies of man, of his du-
ties, and of his immortal privileges. Thus it is that the Ameri-

ments can employ in order to have the doctrine of the im-
mortality of the soul duly respected, is ever to act as if they
believed in it themselves; and I think that it is only by scru-
pulous conformity to religious morality in great affairs that
they can hope to teach the community at large to know, to
love, and to observe it in the lesser concerns of life.

Chapter XVI: That Excessive Care Of Worldly Welfare
May Impair That Welfare

There is a closer tie than is commonly supposed between the
improvement of the soul and the amelioration of what be-
longs to the body. Man may leave these two things apart,
and consider each of them alternately; but he cannot sever
them entirely without at last losing sight of one and of the
other. The beasts have the same senses as ourselves, and very
nearly the same appetites. We have no sensual passions which
are not common to our race and theirs, and which are not to
be found, at least in the germ, in a dog as well as in a man.
Whence is it then that the animals can only provide for their
first and lowest wants, whereas we can infinitely vary and

Chapter XVII: That in Times Marked by Equality of
Conditions and Sceptical Opinions, It Is Important to
Remove to a Distance the Objects of Human Actions

In the ages of faith the final end of life is placed beyond life.
The men of those ages therefore naturally, and in a manner
involuntarily, accustom themselves to fix their gaze for a long
course of years on some immovable object, towards which
they are constantly tending; and they learn by insensible
degrees to repress a multitude of petty passing desires, in
order to be the better able to content that great and lasting
desire which possesses them. When these same men engage
in the affairs of this world, the same habits may be traced in
their conduct. They are apt to set up some general and cer-
tain aim and end to their actions here below, towards which
all their efforts are directed: they do not turn from day to
day to chase some novel object of desire, but they have settled
designs which they are never weary of pursuing. This ex-
plains why religious nations have so often achieved such last-
ing results: for whilst they were thinking only of the other
world, they had found out the great secret of success in this.

beyond. I do not doubt that, by training the members of a
community to think of their future condition in this world,
they would be gradually and unconsciously brought nearer
to religious convictions. Thus the means which allow men,
up to a certain point, to go without religion, are perhaps
after all the only means we still possess for bringing man-
kind back by a long and roundabout path to a state of faith.

Chapter XVIII: That Amongst the Americans All Honest
Callings Are Honorable

Amongst a democratic people, where there is no hereditary
wealth, every man works to earn a living, or has worked, or
is born of parents who have worked. The notion of labor is
therefore presented to the mind on every side as the neces-
sary, natural, and honest condition of human existence. Not
only is labor not dishonorable amongst such a people, but it
is held in honor: the prejudice is not against it, but in its
favor. In the United States a wealthy man thinks that he
owes it to public opinion to devote his leisure to some kind
of industrial or commercial pursuit, or to public business.

He would think himself in bad repute if he employed his life
solely in living. It is for the purpose of escaping this obliga-
tion to work, that so many rich Americans come to Europe,
where they find some scattered remains of aristocratic soci-
ety, amongst which idleness is still held in honor.
Equality of conditions not only ennobles the notion of
labor in men’s estimation, but it raises the notion of labor as
a source of profit. In aristocracies it is not exactly labor that
is despised, but labor with a view to profit. Labor is honor-
ific in itself, when it is undertaken at the sole bidding of
ambition or of virtue. Yet in aristocratic society it constantly
happens that he who works for honor is not insensible to the
attractions of profit. But these two desires only intermingle
in the innermost depths of his soul: he carefully hides from
every eye the point at which they join; he would fain conceal
it from himself. In aristocratic countries there are few public
officers who do not affect to serve their country without in-
terested motives. Their salary is an incident of which they
think but little, and of which they always affect not to think
at all. Thus the notion of profit is kept distinct from that of
labor; however they may be united in point of fact, they are

resemblance. This serves to explain the opinions which the
Americans entertain with respect to different callings. In
America no one is degraded because he works, for everyone
about him works also; nor is anyone humiliated by the no-
tion of receiving pay, for the President of the United States
also works for pay. He is paid for commanding, other men
for obeying orders. In the United States professions are more
or less laborious, more or less profitable; but they are never
either high or low: every honest calling is honorable.

Book Two – Chapters XIX – XX

Chapter XIX: That Almost All The Americans Follow
Industrial Callings

Agriculture is, perhaps, of all the useful arts that which im-
proves most slowly amongst democratic nations. Frequently,
indeed, it would seem to be stationary, because other arts are
making rapid strides towards perfection. On the other hand,
almost all the tastes and habits which the equality of condi-
tion engenders naturally lead men to commercial and indus-
trial occupations.
Suppose an active, enlightened, and free man, enjoying a
competency, but full of desires: he is too poor to live in idle-
ness; he is rich enough to feel himself protected from the
immediate fear of want, and he thinks how he can better his
condition. This man has conceived a taste for physical grati-
fications, which thousands of his fellow-men indulge in
around him; he has himself begun to enjoy these pleasures,
and he is eager to increase his means of satisfying these tastes
more completely. But life is slipping away, time is urgent - to
what is he to turn? The cultivation of the ground promises an
almost certain result to his exertions, but a slow one; men are
not enriched by it without patience and toil. Agriculture is

therefore only suited to those who have already large, super-
fluous wealth, or to those whose penury bids them only seek a
bare subsistence. The choice of such a man as we have sup-
posed is soon made; he sells his plot of ground, leaves his dwell-
ing, and embarks in some hazardous but lucrative calling.
Democratic communities abound in men of this kind; and in
proportion as the equality of conditions becomes greater, their
multitude increases. Thus democracy not only swells the num-
ber of workingmen, but it leads men to prefer one kind of
labor to another; and whilst it diverts them from agriculture,
it encourages their taste for commerce and manufactures.*
*It has often been remarked that manufacturers and mercantile
men are inordinately addicted to physical gratifications, and this
has been attributed to commerce and manufactures; but that is, I
apprehend, to take the effect for the cause. The taste for physical
gratifications is not imparted to men by commerce or manufac-
tures, but it is rather this taste which leads men to embark in
commerce and manufactures, as a means by which they hope to
satisfy themselves more promptly and more completely. If com-
merce and manufactures increase the desire of well-being, it is
because every passion gathers strength in proportion as it is culti-
vated, and is increased by all the efforts made to satiate it. All the
causes which make the love of worldly welfare predominate in the
heart of man are favorable to the growth of commerce and manu-
factures. Equality of conditions is one of those causes; it encour-
ages trade, not directly by giving men a taste for business, but
indirectly by strengthening and expanding in their minds a taste
for prosperity.

hurried into trade and manufactures, which are the shortest
roads that lead to opulence.
This, however, strikes me as an exceptional and transitory
circumstance. When wealth is become the only symbol of
aristocracy, it is very difficult for the wealthy to maintain
sole possession of political power, to the exclusion of all other
men. The aristocracy of birth and pure democracy are at the
two extremes of the social and political state of nations: be-
tween them moneyed aristocracy finds its place. The latter
approximates to the aristocracy of birth by conferring great
privileges on a small number of persons; it so far belongs to
the democratic element, that these privileges may be succes-
sively acquired by all. It frequently forms a natural transition
between these two conditions of society, and it is difficult to
say whether it closes the reign of aristocratic institutions, or
whether it already opens the new era of democracy.

Circumscribed within the narrow space which politics leave
them, rich men in democracies eagerly embark in commer-
cial enterprise: there they can extend and employ their natu-
ral advantages; and indeed it is even by the boldness and the
magnitude of their industrial speculations that we may mea-
sure the slight esteem in which productive industry would
have been held by them, if they had been born amidst an
aristocracy.
A similar observation is likewise applicable to all men liv-
ing in democracies, whether they be poor or rich. Those who
live in the midst of democratic fluctuations have always be-
fore their eyes the phantom of chance; and they end by lik-
ing all undertakings in which chance plays a part. They are
therefore all led to engage in commerce, not only for the
sake of the profit it holds out to them, but for the love of the
constant excitement occasioned by that pursuit.
The United States of America have only been emancipated
for half a century [in 1840] from the state of colonial depen-
dence in which they stood to Great Britain; the number of
large fortunes there is small, and capital is still scarce. Yet no
people in the world has made such rapid progress in trade

and manufactures as the Americans: they constitute at the
present day the second maritime nation in the world; and
although their manufactures have to struggle with almost
insurmountable natural impediments, they are not prevented
from making great and daily advances. In the United States
the greatest undertakings and speculations are executed with-
out difficulty, because the whole population is engaged in
productive industry, and because the poorest as well as the
most opulent members of the commonwealth are ready to
combine their efforts for these purposes. The consequence
is, that a stranger is constantly amazed by the immense pub-
lic works executed by a nation which contains, so to speak,
no rich men. The Americans arrived but as yesterday on the
territory which they inhabit, and they have already changed
the whole order of nature for their own advantage. They
have joined the Hudson to the Mississippi, and made the
Atlantic Ocean communicate with the Gulf of Mexico, across
a continent of more than five hundred leagues in extent which
separates the two seas. The longest railroads which have been
constructed up to the present time are in America. But what
most astonishes me in the United States, is not so much the

and formidable embarrassments. As they are all engaged in
commerce, their commercial affairs are affected by such vari-
ous and complex causes that it is impossible to foresee what
difficulties may arise. As they are all more or less engaged in
productive industry, at the least shock given to business all
private fortunes are put in jeopardy at the same time, and
the State is shaken. I believe that the return of these com-
mercial panics is an endemic disease of the democratic na-
tions of our age. It may be rendered less dangerous, but it
cannot be cured; because it does not originate in accidental
circumstances, but in the temperament of these nations.

Chapter XX: That Aristocracy May Be Engendered by
Manufactures

I have shown that democracy is favorable to the growth of
manufactures, and that it increases without limit the num-
bers of the manufacturing classes: we shall now see by what
side road manufacturers may possibly in their turn bring men
back to aristocracy. It is acknowledged that when a work-
man is engaged every day upon the same detail, the whole

born to obey as that other is to command. What is this but
aristocracy?
As the conditions of men constituting the nation become
more and more equal, the demand for manufactured com-
modities becomes more general and more extensive; and the
cheapness which places these objects within the reach of slen-
der fortunes becomes a great element of success. Hence there
are every day more men of great opulence and education
who devote their wealth and knowledge to manufactures;
and who seek, by opening large establishments, and by a
strict division of labor, to meet the fresh demands which are
made on all sides. Thus, in proportion as the mass of the
nation turns to democracy, that particular class which is en-
gaged in manufactures becomes more aristocratic. Men grow
more alike in the one - more different in the other; and in-
equality increases in the less numerous class in the same ra-
tio in which it decreases in the community. Hence it would
appear, on searching to the bottom, that aristocracy should
naturally spring out of the bosom of democracy.
But this kind of aristocracy by no means resembles those
kinds which preceded it. It will be observed at once, that as

men and the master there are frequent relations, but no real
partnership.
I am of opinion, upon the whole, that the manufacturing
aristocracy which is growing up under our eyes is one of the
harshest which ever existed in the world; but at the same
time it is one of the most confined and least dangerous. Nev-
ertheless the friends of democracy should keep their eyes
anxiously fixed in this direction; for if ever a permanent in-
equality of conditions and aristocracy again penetrate into
the world, it may be predicted that this is the channel by
which they will enter.

Influence Of Democracy On Manners, Properly So
Called

Chapter I: That Manners Are Softened As Social Condi-
tions Become More Equal

We perceive that for several ages social conditions have tended
to equality, and we discover that in the course of the same
period the manners of society have been softened. Are these
two things merely contemporaneous, or does any secret link
exist between them, so that the one cannot go on without
making the other advance? Several causes may concur to ren-
der the manners of a people less rude; but, of all these causes,
the most powerful appears to me to be the equality of condi-
tions. Equality of conditions and growing civility in man-
ners are, then, in my eyes, not only contemporaneous occur-
rences, but correlative facts. When the fabulists seek to in-
terest us in the actions of beasts, they invest them with hu-
man notions and passions; the poets who sing of spirits and

quatre coins de la ville. On a pris soixante bourgeois, et on
commence demain les punitions. Cette province est un bel
exemple pour les autres, et surtout de respecter les gouverneurs
et les gouvernantes, et de ne point jeter de pierres dans leur
jardin.*

In another letter she adds: –
“Vous me parlez bien plaisamment de nos miseres; nous
ne sommes plus si roues; un en huit jours, pour entretenir la
justice. Il est vrai que la penderie me parait maintenant un
refraichissement. J’ai une tout autre idee de la justice, depuis
que je suis en ce pays. Vos galeriens me paraissent une soci-
ete d’honnetes gens qui se sont retires du monde pour mener
une vie douce.”
It would be a mistake to suppose that Madame de Sevigne,
who wrote these lines, was a selfish or cruel person; she was
passionately attached to her children, and very ready to sym-
pathize in the sorrows of her friends; nay, her letters show

*To feel the point of this joke the reader should recollect
that Madame de Grignan was Gouvernante de Provence.]
“Madame de Tarente etait hier dans ces bois par un temps
enchante: il n’est question ni de chambre ni de collation; elle
entre par la barriere et s’en retourne de meme….”

who declaimed so vehemently at the notion of crucifying a
Roman citizen, had not a word to say against these horrible
abuses of victory. It is evident that in his eyes a barbarian did
not belong to the same human race as a Roman. On the
contrary, in proportion as nations become more like each
other, they become reciprocally more compassionate, and
the law of nations is mitigated.

Chapter II: That Democracy Renders the Habitual
Intercourse of the Americans Simple and Easy

Democracy does not attach men strongly to each other; but
it places their habitual intercourse upon an easier footing. If
two Englishmen chance to meet at the Antipodes, where they
are surrounded by strangers whose language and manners
are almost unknown to them, they will first stare at each
other with much curiosity and a kind of secret uneasiness;
they will then turn away, or, if one accosts the other, they
will take care only to converse with a constrained and absent
air upon very unimportant subjects. Yet there is no enmity
between these men; they have never seen each other before,

varied by wealth, ranks still exist, but it is not easy clearly to
distinguish at a glance those who respectively belong to them.
Secret hostilities then arise in the community; one set of men
endeavor by innumerable artifices to penetrate, or to appear
to penetrate, amongst those who are above them; another
set are constantly in arms against these usurpers of their rights;
or rather the same individual does both at once, and whilst
he seeks to raise himself into a higher circle, he is always on
the defensive against the intrusion of those below him.
Such is the condition of England at the present time; and
I am of opinion that the peculiarity before adverted to is
principally to be attributed to this cause. As aristocratic pride
is still extremely great amongst the English, and as the limits
of aristocracy are ill-defined, everybody lives in constant dread
lest advantage should be taken of his familiarity. Unable to
judge at once of the social position of those he meets, an
Englishman prudently avoids all contact with them. Men
are afraid lest some slight service rendered should draw them
into an unsuitable acquaintance; they dread civilities, and
they avoid the obtrusive gratitude of a stranger quite as much
as his hatred. Many people attribute these singular anti-so-

cial propensities, and the reserved and taciturn bearing of
the English, to purely physical causes. I may admit that there
is something of it in their race, but much more of it is attrib-
utable to their social condition, as is proved by the contrast
of the Americans.
In America, where the privileges of birth never existed,
and where riches confer no peculiar rights on their possess-
ors, men unacquainted with each other are very ready to
frequent the same places, and find neither peril nor advan-
tage in the free interchange of their thoughts. If they meet
by accident, they neither seek nor avoid intercourse; their
manner is therefore natural, frank, and open: it is easy to see
that they hardly expect or apprehend anything from each
other, and that they do not care to display, any more than to
conceal, their position in the world. If their demeanor is of-
ten cold and serious, it is never haughty or constrained; and
if they do not converse, it is because they are not in a humor
to talk, not because they think it their interest to be silent. In
a foreign country two Americans are at once friends, simply
because they are Americans. They are repulsed by no preju-
dice; they are attracted by their common country. For two

Englishmen the same blood is not enough; they must be
brought together by the same rank. The Americans remark
this unsociable mood of the English as much as the French
do, and they are not less astonished by it. Yet the Americans
are connected with England by their origin, their religion,
their language, and partially by their manners; they only dif-
fer in their social condition. It may therefore be inferred that
the reserve of the English proceeds from the constitution of
their country much more than from that of its inhabitants.

Chapter III: Why the Americans Show so Little Sensi-
tiveness in Their Own Country, and Are so Sensitive in
Europe

The temper of the Americans is vindictive, like that of all
serious and reflecting nations. They hardly ever forget an
offence, but it is not easy to offend them; and their resent-
ment is as slow to kindle as it is to abate. In aristocratic com-
munities where a small number of persons manage every-
thing, the outward intercourse of men is subject to settled
conventional rules. Everyone then thinks he knows exactly

United States constantly bring citizens of all ranks into con-
tact, and compel them to pursue great undertakings in con-
cert. People thus engaged have scarcely time to attend to the
details of etiquette, and they are besides too strongly inter-
ested in living harmoniously for them to stick at such things.
They therefore soon acquire a habit of considering the feel-
ings and opinions of those whom they meet more than their
manners, and they do not allow themselves to be annoyed
by trifles.
I have often remarked in the United States that it is not
easy to make a man understand that his presence may be
dispensed with; hints will not always suffice to shake him
off. I contradict an American at every word he says, to show
him that his conversation bores me; he instantly labors with
fresh pertinacity to convince me; I preserve a dogged silence,
and he thinks I am meditating deeply on the truths which
he is uttering; at last I rush from his company, and he sup-
poses that some urgent business hurries me elsewhere. This
man will never understand that he wearies me to extinction
unless I tell him so: and the only way to get rid of him is to
make him my enemy for life.

which prevails in the United States; aloud he makes it the
boast of his country, but in secret he deplores it for himself;
and he aspires to show that, for his part, he is an exception to
the general state of things which he vaunts. There is hardly
an American to be met with who does not claim some re-
mote kindred with the first founders of the colonies; and as
for the scions of the noble families of England, America
seemed to me to be covered with them. When an opulent
American arrives in Europe, his first care is to surround him-
self with all the luxuries of wealth: he is so afraid of being
taken for the plain citizen of a democracy, that he adopts a
hundred distorted ways of bringing some new instance of
his wealth before you every day. His house will be in the
most fashionable part of the town: he will always be sur-
rounded by a host of servants. I have heard an American
complain, that in the best houses of Paris the society was
rather mixed; the taste which prevails there was not pure
enough for him; and he ventured to hint that, in his opin-
ion, there was a want of elegance of manner; he could not
accustom himself to see wit concealed under such unpre-
tending forms.

These contrasts ought not to surprise us. If the vestiges of
former aristocratic distinctions were not so completely ef-
faced in the United States, the Americans would be less simple
and less tolerant in their own country – they would require
less, and be less fond of borrowed manners in ours.

Chapter IV: Consequences of the Three Preceding
Chapters

When men feel a natural compassion for their mutual suf-
ferings – when they are brought together by easy and fre-
quent intercourse, and no sensitive feelings keep them asun-
der – it may readily be supposed that they will lend assis-
tance to one another whenever it is needed. When an Ameri-
can asks for the co-operation of his fellow-citizens it is sel-
dom refused, and I have often seen it afforded spontane-
ously and with great goodwill. If an accident happens on the
highway, everybody hastens to help the sufferer; if some great
and sudden calamity befalls a family, the purses of a thou-
sand strangers are at once willingly opened, and small but
numerous donations pour in to relieve their distress. It often

happens amongst the most civilized nations of the globe,
that a poor wretch is as friendless in the midst of a crowd as
the savage in his wilds: this is hardly ever the case in the
United States. The Americans, who are always cold and of-
ten coarse in their manners, seldom show insensibility; and
if they do not proffer services eagerly, yet they do not refuse
to render them.
All this is not in contradiction to what I have said before
on the subject of individualism. The two things are so far
from combating each other, that I can see how they agree.
Equality of conditions, whilst it makes men feel their inde-
pendence, shows them their own weakness: they are free,
but exposed to a thousand accidents; and experience soon
teaches them that, although they do not habitually require
the assistance of others, a time almost always comes when
they cannot do without it. We constantly see in Europe that
men of the same profession are ever ready to assist each other;
they are all exposed to the same ills, and that is enough to
teach them to seek mutual preservatives, however hard-
hearted and selfish they may otherwise be. When one of them
falls into danger, from which the others may save him by a

slight transient sacrifice or a sudden effort, they do not fail
to make the attempt. Not that they are deeply interested in
his fate; for if, by chance, their exertions are unavailing, they
immediately forget the object of them, and return to their
own business; but a sort of tacit and almost involuntary agree-
ment has been passed between them, by which each one owes
to the others a temporary support which he may claim for
himself in turn. Extend to a people the remark here applied
to a class, and you will understand my meaning. A similar
covenant exists in fact between all the citizens of a democ-
racy: they all feel themselves subject to the same weakness
and the same dangers; and their interest, as well as their sym-
pathy, makes it a rule with them to lend each other mutual
assistance when required. The more equal social conditions
become, the more do men display this reciprocal disposition
to oblige each other. In democracies no great benefits are
conferred, but good offices are constantly rendered: a man
seldom displays self- devotion, but all men are ready to be of
service to one another.

Book Three  – Chapters V – VII

Chapter V: How Democracy Affects the Relation of
Masters and Servants

An American who had travelled for a long time in Europe
once said to me, “The English treat their servants with a
stiffness and imperiousness of manner which surprise us; but
on the other hand the French sometimes treat their atten-
dants with a degree of familiarity or of politeness which we
cannot conceive. It looks as if they were afraid to give orders:
the posture of the superior and the inferior is ill-maintained.”
The remark was a just one, and I have often made it myself.
I have always considered England as the country in the world
where, in our time, the bond of domestic service is drawn
most tightly, and France as the country where it is most re-
laxed. Nowhere have I seen masters stand so high or so low
as in these two countries. Between these two extremes the
Americans are to be placed. Such is the fact as it appears
upon the surface of things: to discover the causes of that
fact, it is necessary to search the matter thoroughly.

masters, men exercise a great influence over each other: they
acknowledge settled rules, and in the absence of law they are
guided by a sort of public opinion: their habits are settled,
and their conduct is placed under a certain control.
These men, whose destiny is to obey, certainly do not un-
derstand fame, virtue, honesty, and honor in the same man-
ner as their masters; but they have a pride, a virtue, and an
honesty pertaining to their condition; and they have a no-
tion, if I may use the expression, of a sort of servile honor.*
Because a class is mean, it must not be supposed that all who
belong to it are mean- hearted; to think so would be a great
mistake. However lowly it may be, he who is foremost there,
and who has no notion of quitting it, occupies an aristo-
cratic position which inspires him with lofty feelings, pride,
and self-respect, that fit him for the higher virtues and ac-
tions above the common. Amongst aristocratic nations it was

*If the principal opinions by which men are guided are ex-
amined closely and in detail, the analogy appears still more
striking, and one is surprised to find amongst them, just as
much as amongst the haughtiest scions of a feudal race, pride
of birth, respect for their ancestry and their descendants, dis-
dain of their inferiors, a dread of contact, a taste for etiquette,
precedents, and antiquity.

countries the master readily obtains prompt, complete, respect-
ful, and easy obedience from his servants, because they revere
in him not only their master but the class of masters. He weighs
down their will by the whole weight of the aristocracy. He
orders their actions -to a certain extent he even directs their
thoughts. In aristocracies the master often exercises, even with-
out being aware of it, an amazing sway over the opinions, the
habits, and the manners of those who obey him, and his influ-
ence extends even further than his authority.
In aristocratic communities there are not only hereditary
families of servants as well as of masters, but the same fami-
lies of servants adhere for several generations to the same
families of masters (like two parallel lines which neither meet
nor separate); and this considerably modifies the mutual re-
lations of these two classes of persons. Thus, although in
aristocratic society the master and servant have no natural
resemblance -although, on the contrary, they are placed at
an immense distance on the scale of human beings by their
fortune, education, and opinions - yet time ultimately binds
them together. They are connected by a long series of com-
mon reminiscences, and however different they may be, they

dition; domestic service is looked upon by masters in the
same light; and the precise limits of authority and obedience
are as clearly settled in the mind of the one as in that of the
other.
When the greater part of the community have long at-
tained a condition nearly alike, and when equality is an old
and acknowledged fact, the public mind, which is never af-
fected by exceptions, assigns certain general limits to the value
of man, above or below which no man can long remain
placed. It is in vain that wealth and poverty, authority and
obedience, accidentally interpose great distances between two
men; public opinion, founded upon the usual order of things,
draws them to a common level, and creates a species of imagi-
nary equality between them, in spite of the real inequality of
their conditions. This all-powerful opinion penetrates at length
even into the hearts of those whose interest might arm them
to resist it; it affects their judgment whilst it subdues their
will. In their inmost convictions the master and the servant
no longer perceive any deep-seated difference between them,
and they neither hope nor fear to meet with any such at any
time. They are therefore neither subject to disdain nor to an-

ter. But whilst the transition from one social condition to
another is going on, there is almost always a time when men’s
minds fluctuate between the aristocratic notion of subjec-
tion and the democratic notion of obedience. Obedience then
loses its moral importance in the eyes of him who obeys; he
no longer considers it as a species of divine obligation, and
he does not yet view it under its purely human aspect; it has
to him no character of sanctity or of justice, and he submits
to it as to a degrading but profitable condition. At that mo-
ment a confused and imperfect phantom of equality haunts
the minds of servants; they do not at once perceive whether
the equality to which they are entitled is to be found within
or without the pale of domestic service; and they rebel in
their hearts against a subordination to which they have sub-
jected themselves, and from which they derive actual profit.
They consent to serve, and they blush to obey; they like the
advantages of service, but not the master; or rather, they are
not sure that they ought not themselves to be masters, and
they are inclined to consider him who orders them as an
unjust usurper of their own rights. Then it is that the dwell-
ing of every citizen offers a spectacle somewhat analogous to

the gloomy aspect of political society. A secret and intestine
warfare is going on there between powers, ever rivals and
suspicious of one another: the master is ill-natured and weak,
the servant ill-natured and intractable; the one constantly
attempts to evade by unfair restrictions his obligation to pro-
tect and to remunerate – the other his obligation to obey.
The reins of domestic government dangle between them, to
be snatched at by one or the other. The lines which divide
authority from oppression, liberty from license, and right
from might, are to their eyes so jumbled together and con-
fused, that no one knows exactly what he is, or what he may
be, or what he ought to be. Such a condition is not democ-
racy, but revolution.

Chapter VI: That Democratic institutions and Manners
Tend to Raise Rents and Shorten the Terms of Leases

What has been said of servants and masters is applicable, to
a certain extent, to landowners and farming tenants; but this
subject deserves to be considered by itself. In America there
are, properly speaking, no tenant farmers; every man owns

was not supposed that anything would ever be stirred or
shaken in its structure. In ages of equality, the human mind
takes a different bent; the prevailing notion is that nothing
abides, and man is haunted by the thought of mutability.
Under this impression the landowner and the tenant himself
are instinctively averse to protracted terms of obligation; they
are afraid of being tied up to-morrow by the contract which
benefits them today. They have vague anticipations of some
sudden and unforeseen change in their conditions; they mis-
trust themselves; they fear lest their taste should change, and
lest they should lament that they cannot rid themselves of
what they coveted; nor are such fears unfounded, for in demo-
cratic ages that which is most fluctuating amidst the fluctua-
tion of all around is the heart of man.

Chapter VII: Influence of Democracy on Wages

Most of the remarks which I have already made in speaking
of servants and masters, may be applied to masters and work-
men. As the gradations of the social scale come to be less
observed, whilst the great sink the humble rise, and as pov-

them what he loses by the chances of business. Should the
workmen strike, the master, who is a rich man, can very well
wait without being ruined until necessity brings them back
to him; but they must work day by day or they die, for their
only property is in their hands. They have long been impov-
erished by oppression, and the poorer they become the more
easily may they be oppressed: they can never escape from
this fatal circle of cause and consequence. It is not then sur-
prising that wages, after having sometimes suddenly risen,
are permanently lowered in this branch of industry; whereas
in other callings the price of labor, which generally increases
but little, is nevertheless constantly augmented.
This state of dependence and wretchedness, in which a
part of the manufacturing population of our time lives, forms
an exception to the general rule, contrary to the state of all
the rest of the community; but, for this very reason, no cir-
cumstance is more important or more deserving of the espe-
cial consideration of the legislator; for when the whole of
society is in motion, it is difficult to keep any one class sta-
tionary; and when the greater number of men are opening
new paths to fortune, it is no less difficult to make the few
support in peace their wants and their desires.

Book Three – Chapters VIII – X

Chapter VIII: Influence Of Democracy On Kindred

I have just examined the changes which the equality of con-
ditions produces in the mutual relations of the several mem-
bers of the community amongst democratic nations, and
amongst the Americans in particular. I would now go deeper,
and inquire into the closer ties of kindred: my object here is
not to seek for new truths, but to show in what manner facts
already known are connected with my subject.
It has been universally remarked, that in our time the sev-
eral members of a family stand upon an entirely new footing
towards each other; that the distance which formerly sepa-
rated a father from his sons has been lessened; and that pa-
ternal authority, if not destroyed, is at least impaired. Some-
thing analogous to this, but even more striking, may be ob-
served in the United States. In America the family, in the
Roman and aristocratic signification of the word, does not
exist. All that remains of it are a few vestiges in the first years
of childhood, when the father exercises, without opposition,

that absolute domestic authority, which the feebleness of his
children renders necessary, and which their interest, as well
as his own incontestable superiority, warrants. But as soon as
the young American approaches manhood, the ties of filial
obedience are relaxed day by day: master of his thoughts, he
is soon master of his conduct. In America there is, strictly
speaking, no adolescence: at the close of boyhood the man
appears, and begins to trace out his own path. It would be an
error to suppose that this is preceded by a domestic struggle,
in which the son has obtained by a sort of moral violence the
liberty that his father refused him. The same habits, the same
principles which impel the one to assert his independence,
predispose the other to consider the use of that indepen-
dence as an incontestable right. The former does not exhibit
any of those rancorous or irregular passions which disturb
men long after they have shaken off an established author-
ity; the latter feels none of that bitter and angry regret which
is apt to survive a bygone power. The father foresees the lim-
its of his authority long beforehand, and when the time ar-
rives he surrenders it without a struggle: the son looks for-
ward to the exact period at which he will be his own master;

and he enters upon his freedom without precipitation and
without effort, as a possession which is his own and which
no one seeks to wrest from him.*
*The Americans, however, have not yet thought fit to strip
the parent, as has been done in France, of one of the chief
elements of parental authority, by depriving him of the power
of disposing of his property at his death. In the United States
there are no restrictions on the powers of a testator. In this
respect, as in almost all others, it is easy to perceive, that if
the political legislation of the Americans is much more demo-
cratic than that of the French, the civil legislation of the lat-
ter is infinitely more democratic than that of the former.
This may easily be accounted for. The civil legislation of
France was the work of a man who saw that it was his inter-
est to satisfy the democratic passions of his contemporaries
in all that was not directly and immediately hostile to his
own power. He was willing to allow some popular principles
to regulate the distribution of property and the government
of families, provided they were not to be introduced into the
administration of public affairs. Whilst the torrent of de-
mocracy overwhelmed the civil laws of the country, he hoped
to find an easy shelter behind its political institutions. This
policy was at once both adroit and selfish; but a compromise
of this kind could not last; for in the end political institu-
tions never fail to become the image and expression of civil
society; and in this sense it may be said that nothing is more
political in a nation than its civil legislation.

It may perhaps not be without utility to show how these
changes which take place in family relations, are closely con-
nected with the social and political revolution which is ap-
proaching its consummation under our own observation.
There are certain great social principles, which a people ei-
ther introduces everywhere, or tolerates nowhere. In coun-
tries which are aristocratically constituted with all the grada-
tions of rank, the government never makes a direct appeal to
the mass of the governed: as men are united together, it is
enough to lead the foremost, the rest will follow. This is
equally applicable to the family, as to all aristocracies which
have a head. Amongst aristocratic nations, social institutions
recognize, in truth, no one in the family but the father; chil-
dren are received by society at his hands; society governs him,
he governs them. Thus the parent has not only a natural
right, but he acquires a political right, to command them: he
is the author and the support of his family; but he is also its
constituted ruler. In democracies, where the government picks
out every individual singly from the mass, to make him sub-
servient to the general laws of the community, no such in-
termediate person is required: a father is there, in the eye of

ticular manner, it seldom fails to weaken them; by attempt-
ing to add to their intensity, it robs them of some of their
elements, for they are never stronger than when left to them-
selves.
Democracy, which destroys or obscures almost all the old
conventional rules of society, and which prevents men from
readily assenting to new ones, entirely effaces most of the
feelings to which these conventional rules have given rise;
but it only modifies some others, and frequently imparts to
them a degree of energy and sweetness unknown before. Per-
haps it is not impossible to condense into a single proposi-
tion the whole meaning of this chapter, and of several others
that preceded it. Democracy loosens social ties, but it draws
the ties of nature more tight; it brings kindred more closely
together, whilst it places the various members of the com-
munity more widely apart.

Chapter IX: Education of Young Women in the United
States

No free communities ever existed without morals; and, as I
observed in the former part of this work, morals are the work
of woman. Consequently, whatever affects the condition of
women, their habits and their opinions, has great political
importance in my eyes. Amongst almost all Protestant na-
tions young women are far more the mistresses of their own
actions than they are in Catholic countries. This indepen-
dence is still greater in Protestant countries, like England,
which have retained or acquired the right of self-government;
the spirit of freedom is then infused into the domestic circle
by political habits and by religious opinions. In the United
States the doctrines of Protestantism are combined with great
political freedom and a most democratic state of society; and
nowhere are young women surrendered so early or so com-
pletely to their own guidance. Long before an American girl
arrives at the age of marriage, her emancipation from mater-
nal control begins; she has scarcely ceased to be a child when
she already thinks for herself, speaks with freedom, and acts

most vehement passions of the human heart, they held that
the surer way was to teach her the art of combating those
passions for herself. As they could not prevent her virtue
from being exposed to frequent danger, they determined that
she should know how best to defend it; and more reliance
was placed on the free vigor of her will than on safeguards
which have been shaken or overthrown. Instead, then, of
inculcating mistrust of herself, they constantly seek to en-
hance their confidence in her own strength of character. As
it is neither possible nor desirable to keep a young woman in
perpetual or complete ignorance, they hasten to give her a
precocious knowledge on all subjects. Far from hiding the
corruptions of the world from her, they prefer that she should
see them at once and train herself to shun them; and they
hold it of more importance to protect her conduct than to
be over-scrupulous of her innocence.
Although the Americans are a very religious people, they
do not rely on religion alone to defend the virtue of woman;
they seek to arm her reason also. In this they have followed
the same method as in several other respects; they first make
the most vigorous efforts to bring individual independence

to exercise a proper control over itself, and they do not call
in the aid of religion until they have reached the utmost lim-
its of human strength. I am aware that an education of this
kind is not without danger; I am sensible that it tends to
invigorate the judgment at the expense of the imagination,
and to make cold and virtuous women instead of affection-
ate wives and agreeable companions to man. Society may be
more tranquil and better regulated, but domestic life has of-
ten fewer charms. These, however, are secondary evils, which
may be braved for the sake of higher interests. At the stage at
which we are now arrived the time for choosing is no longer
within our control; a democratic education is indispensable
to protect women from the dangers with which democratic
institutions and manners surround them.

Chapter X: The Young Woman in the Character of a Wife

In America the independence of woman is irrevocably lost
in the bonds of matrimony: if an unmarried woman is less
constrained there than elsewhere, a wife is subjected to stricter
obligations. The former makes her father’s house an abode

try in the world are private fortunes more precarious than in
the United States. It is not uncommon for the same man, in
the course of his life, to rise and sink again through all the
grades which lead from opulence to poverty. American
women support these vicissitudes with calm and unquench-
able energy: it would seem that their desires contract, as eas-
ily as they expand, with their fortunes.*

The greater part of the adventurers who migrate every year
to people the western wilds, belong, as I observed in the
former part of this work, to the old Anglo-American race of
the Northern States. Many of these men, who rush so boldly
onwards in pursuit of wealth, were already in the enjoyment
of a competency in their own part of the country. They take
their wives along with them, and make them share the count-
less perils and privations which always attend the commence-
ment of these expeditions. I have often met, even on the
verge of the wilderness, with young women, who after hav-
ing been brought up amidst all the comforts of the large
towns of New England, had passed, almost without any in-
termediate stage, from the wealthy abode of their parents to

*See Appendix S.

a comfortless hovel in a forest. Fever, solitude, and a tedious
life had not broken the springs of their courage. Their fea-
tures were impaired and faded, but their looks were firm:
they appeared to be at once sad and resolute. I do not doubt
that these young American women had amassed, in the edu-
cation of their early years, that inward strength which they
displayed under these circumstances. The early culture of
the girl may still therefore be traced, in the United States,
under the aspect of marriage: her part is changed, her habits
are different, but her character is the same.

Chapter XI: That the Equality of Conditions Contrib-
utes to the Maintenance of Good Morals in America

Some philosophers and historians have said, or have hinted,
that the strictness of female morality was increased or dimin-
ished simply by the distance of a country from the equator.
This solution of the difficulty was an easy one; and nothing
was required but a globe and a pair of compasses to settle in an
instant one of the most difficult problems in the condition of
mankind. But I am not aware that this principle of the mate-
rialists is supported by facts. The same nations have been chaste
or dissolute at different periods of their history; the strictness
or the laxity of their morals depended therefore on some vari-
able cause, not only on the natural qualities of their country,
which were invariable. I do not deny that in certain climates
the passions which are occasioned by the mutual attraction of
the sexes are peculiarly intense; but I am of opinion that this
natural intensity may always be excited or restrained by the
condition of society and by political institutions.

Amongst aristocratic nations birth and fortune frequently
make two such different beings of man and woman, that
they can never be united to each other. Their passions draw
them together, but the condition of society, and the notions
suggested by it, prevent them from contracting a permanent
and ostensible tie. The necessary consequence is a great num-
ber of transient and clandestine connections. Nature secretly
avenges herself for the constraint imposed upon her by the
laws of man. This is not so much the case when the equality
of conditions has swept away all the imaginary, or the real,
barriers which separated man from woman. No girl then
believes that she cannot become the wife of the man who
loves her; and this renders all breaches of morality before
marriage very uncommon: for, whatever be the credulity of
the passions, a woman will hardly be able to persuade herself
that she is beloved, when her lover is perfectly free to marry
her and does not.
The same cause operates, though more indirectly, on mar-
ried life. Nothing better serves to justify an illicit passion,
either to the minds of those who have conceived it or to the
world which looks on, than compulsory or accidental mar-

riages.* In a country in which a woman is always free to
exercise her power of choosing, and in which education has
prepared her to choose rightly, public opinion is inexorable
to her faults. The rigor of the Americans arises in part from
this cause. They consider marriages as a covenant which is
often onerous, but every condition of which the parties are
strictly bound to fulfil, because they knew all those condi-
tions beforehand, and were perfectly free not to have con-
tracted them.
*The literature of Europe sufficiently corroborates this re-
mark. When a European author wishes to depict in a work
of imagination any of these great catastrophes in matrimony
which so frequently occur amongst us, he takes care to be-
speak the compassion of the reader by bringing before him
ill-assorted or compulsory marriages. Although habitual tol-
erance has long since relaxed our morals, an author could
hardly succeed in interesting us in the misfortunes of his
characters, if he did not first palliate their faults. This artifice
seldom fails: the daily scenes we witness prepare us long be-
forehand to be indulgent. But American writers could never
render these palliations probable to their readers; their cus-
toms and laws are opposed to it; and as they despair of ren-
dering levity of conduct pleasing, they cease to depict it. This
is one of the causes to which must be attributed the small
number of novels published in the United States.

but it neither felt the revolutionary passions nor shared in
the anarchical excitement which produced that crisis; it may
easily be conceived that this aristocracy feels the salutary in-
fluence of the Revolution in its manners, before those who
achieve it. It may therefore be said, though at first it seems
paradoxical, that, at the present day, the most anti-demo-
cratic classes of the nation principally exhibit the kind of
morality which may reasonably be anticipated from democ-
racy. I cannot but think that when we shall have obtained all
the effects of this democratic Revolution, after having got
rid of the tumult it has caused, the observations which are
now only applicable to the few will gradually become true of
the whole community.

Chapter XII: How the Americans Understand the Equal-
ity of the Sexes

I Have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the dif-
ferent inequalities which originate in society; but is this all?
or does it not ultimately affect that great inequality of man
and woman which has seemed, up to the present day, to be

and fear. It would seem that in Europe, where man so easily
submits to the despotic sway of women, they are neverthe-
less curtailed of some of the greatest qualities of the human
species, and considered as seductive but imperfect beings;
and (what may well provoke astonishment) women ultimately
look upon themselves in the same light, and almost consider
it as a privilege that they are entitled to show themselves
futile, feeble, and timid. The women of America claim no
such privileges.
Again, it may be said that in our morals we have reserved
strange immunities to man; so that there is, as it were, one
virtue for his use, and another for the guidance of his part-
ner; and that, according to the opinion of the public, the
very same act may be punished alternately as a crime or only
as a fault. The Americans know not this iniquitous division
of duties and rights; amongst them the seducer is as much
dishonored as his victim. It is true that the Americans rarely
lavish upon women those eager attentions which are com-
monly paid them in Europe; but their conduct to women
always implies that they suppose them to be virtuous and
refined; and such is the respect entertained for the moral

Chapter XIII: That the Principle of Equality Naturally
Divides the Americans into a Number of Small Private
Circles

It may probably be supposed that the final consequence and
necessary effect of democratic institutions is to confound
together all the members of the community in private as
well as in public life, and to compel them all to live in com-
mon; but this would be to ascribe a very coarse and oppres-
sive form to the equality which originates in democracy. No
state of society or laws can render men so much alike, but
that education, fortune, and tastes will interpose some dif-
ferences between them; and, though different men may some-
times find it their interest to combine for the same purposes,
they will never make it their pleasure. They will therefore
always tend to evade the provisions of legislation, whatever
they may be; and departing in some one respect from the
circle within which they were to be bounded, they will set
up, close by the great political community, small private
circles, united together by the similitude of their conditions,
habits, and manners.

In aristocracies men are separated from each other by lofty
stationary barriers; in democracies they are divided by a num-
ber of small and almost invisible threads, which are con-
stantly broken or moved from place to place. Thus, what-
ever may be the progress of equality, in democratic nations a
great number of small private communities will always be
formed within the general pale of political society; but none
of them will bear any resemblance in its manners to the high-
est class in aristocracies.

Chapter XIV: Some Reflections on American Manners

Nothing seems at first sight less important than the outward
form of human actions, yet there is nothing upon which
men set more store: they grow used to everything except to
living in a society which has not their own manners. The
influence of the social and political state of a country upon
manners is therefore deserving of serious examination. Man-
ners are, generally, the product of the very basis of the char-
acter of a people, but they are also sometimes the result of an
arbitrary convention between certain men; thus they are at

regularity and the dignity which they often display amongst
aristocratic nations, nor the simplicity and freedom which
they sometimes assume in democracies; they are at once con-
strained and without constraint.
This, however, is not the normal state of things. When the
equality of conditions is long established and complete, as
all men entertain nearly the same notions and do nearly the
same things, they do not require to agree or to copy from
one another in order to speak or act in the same manner:
their manners are constantly characterized by a number of
lesser diversities, but not by any great differences. They are
never perfectly alike, because they do not copy from the same
pattern; they are never very unlike, because their social con-
dition is the same. At first sight a traveller would observe
that the manners of all the Americans are exactly similar; it is
only upon close examination that the peculiarities in which
they differ may be detected.
The English make game of the manners of the Americans;
but it is singular that most of the writers who have drawn
these ludicrous delineations belonged themselves to the
middle classes in England, to whom the same delineations

are exceedingly applicable: so that these pitiless censors for
the most part furnish an example of the very thing they blame
in the United States; they do not perceive that they are de-
riding themselves, to the great amusement of the aristocracy
of their own country.
Nothing is more prejudicial to democracy than its out-
ward forms of behavior: many men would willingly endure
its vices, who cannot support its manners. I cannot, how-
ever, admit that there is nothing commendable in the man-
ners of a democratic people. Amongst aristocratic nations,
all who live within reach of the first class in society com-
monly strain to be like it, which gives rise to ridiculous and
insipid imitations. As a democratic people does not possess
any models of high breeding, at least it escapes the daily ne-
cessity of seeing wretched copies of them. In democracies
manners are never so refined as amongst aristocratic nations,
but on the other hand they are never so coarse. Neither the
coarse oaths of the populace, nor the elegant and choice ex-
pressions of the nobility are to be heard there: the manners
of such a people are often vulgar, but they are neither brutal
nor mean. I have already observed that in democracies no

such thing as a regular code of good breeding can be laid
down; this has some inconveniences and some advantages.
In aristocracies the rules of propriety impose the same de-
meanor on everyone; they make all the members of the same
class appear alike, in spite of their private inclinations; they
adorn and they conceal the natural man. Amongst a demo-
cratic people manners are neither so tutored nor so uniform,
but they are frequently more sincere. They form, as it were,
a light and loosely woven veil, through which the real feel-
ings and private opinions of each individual are easily dis-
cernible. The form and the substance of human actions of-
ten, therefore, stand in closer relation; and if the great pic-
ture of human life be less embellished, it is more true. Thus
it may be said, in one sense, that the effect of democracy is
not exactly to give men any particular manners, but to pre-
vent them from having manners at all.
The feelings, the passions, the virtues, and the vices of an
aristocracy may sometimes reappear in a democracy, but not
its manners; they are lost, and vanish forever, as soon as the
democratic revolution is completed. It would seem that noth-
ing is more lasting than the manners of an aristocratic class,

I am aware that it has not unfrequently happened that the
same men have had very high-bred manners and very low-
born feelings: the interior of courts has sufficiently shown
what imposing externals may conceal the meanest hearts.
But though the manners of aristocracy did not constitute
virtue, they sometimes embellish virtue itself. It was no ordi-
nary sight to see a numerous and powerful class of men,
whose every outward action seemed constantly to be dic-
tated by a natural elevation of thought and feeling, by deli-
cacy and regularity of taste, and by urbanity of manners.
Those manners threw a pleasing illusory charm over human
nature; and though the picture was often a false one, it could
not be viewed without a noble satisfaction.

Chapter XV: Of The Gravity Of The Americans, And
Why It Does Not Prevent Them From Often Commit-
ting Inconsiderate Actions

Men who live in democratic countries do not value the simple,
turbulent, or coarse diversions in which the people indulge
in aristocratic communities: such diversions are thought by
them to be puerile or insipid. Nor have they a greater incli-
nation for the intellectual and refined amusements of the
aristocratic classes. They want something productive and
substantial in their pleasures; they want to mix actual frui-
tion with their joy. In aristocratic communities the people
readily give themselves up to bursts of tumultuous and bois-
terous gayety, which shake off at once the recollection of
their privations: the natives of democracies are not fond of
being thus violently broken in upon, and they never lose
sight of their own selves without regret. They prefer to these
frivolous delights those more serious and silent amusements
which are like business, and which do not drive business

But I detect another more deep-seated and powerful cause
which instinctively produces amongst the Americans this as-
tonishing gravity. Under a despotism communities give way
at times to bursts of vehement joy; but they are generally
gloomy and moody, because they are afraid. Under absolute
monarchies tempered by the customs and manners of the coun-
try, their spirits are often cheerful and even, because as they
have some freedom and a good deal of security, they are ex-
empted from the most important cares of life; but all free
peoples are serious, because their minds are habitually absorbed
by the contemplation of some dangerous or difficult purpose.
This is more especially the case amongst those free nations
which form democratic communities. Then there are in all
classes a very large number of men constantly occupied with
the serious affairs of the government; and those whose thoughts
are not engaged in the direction of the commonwealth are
wholly engrossed by the acquisition of a private fortune.
Amongst such a people a serious demeanor ceases to be pecu-
liar to certain men, and becomes a habit of the nation.
We are told of small democracies in the days of antiquity, in
which the citizens met upon the public places with garlands

these occupations. The habit of inattention must be consid-
ered as the greatest bane of the democratic character.

Chapter XVI: Why the National Vanity of the Americans
Is More Restless and Captious Than That of the English

All free nations are vainglorious, but national pride is not
displayed by all in the same manner. The Americans in their
intercourse with strangers appear impatient of the smallest
censure and insatiable of praise. The most slender eulogium
is acceptable to them; the most exalted seldom contents them;
they unceasingly harass you to extort praise, and if you resist
their entreaties they fall to praising themselves. It would seem
as if, doubting their own merit, they wished to have it con-
stantly exhibited before their eyes. Their vanity is not only
greedy, but restless and jealous; it will grant nothing, whilst
it demands everything, but is ready to beg and to quarrel at
the same time. If I say to an American that the country he
lives in is a fine one, “Ay,” he replies, “there is not its fellow
in the world.” If I applaud the freedom which its inhabitants
enjoy, he answers, “Freedom is a fine thing, but few nations

are worthy to enjoy it.” If I remark the purity of morals which
distinguishes the United States, “I can imagine,” says he,
“that a stranger, who has been struck by the corruption of all
other nations, is astonished at the difference.” At length I
leave him to the contemplation of himself; but he returns to
the charge, and does not desist till he has got me to repeat all
I had just been saying. It is impossible to conceive a more
troublesome or more garrulous patriotism; it wearies even
those who are disposed to respect it.*

Such is not the case with the English. An Englishman
calmly enjoys the real or imaginary advantages which in his
opinion his country possesses. If he grants nothing to other
nations, neither does he solicit anything for his own. The
censure of foreigners does not affect him, and their praise
hardly flatters him; his position with regard to the rest of the
world is one of disdainful and ignorant reserve: his pride
requires no sustenance, it nourishes itself. It is remarkable
that two nations, so recently sprung from the same stock,
should be so opposite to one another in their manner of
feeling and conversing.

*See Appendix U.

them. In democracies, as the conditions of life are very fluc-
tuating, men have almost always recently acquired the ad-
vantages which they possess; the consequence is that they
feel extreme pleasure in exhibiting them, to show others and
convince themselves that they really enjoy them. As at any
instant these same advantages may be lost, their possessors
are constantly on the alert, and make a point of showing
that they still retain them. Men living in democracies love
their country just as they love themselves, and they transfer
the habits of their private vanity to their vanity as a nation.
The restless and insatiable vanity of a democratic people origi-
nates so entirely in the equality and precariousness of social
conditions, that the members of the haughtiest nobility dis-
play the very same passion in those lesser portions of their
existence in which there is anything fluctuating or contested.
An aristocratic class always differs greatly from the other
classes of the nation, by the extent and perpetuity of its privi-
leges; but it often happens that the only differences between
the members who belong to it consist in small transient ad-
vantages, which may any day be lost or acquired. The mem-
bers of a powerful aristocracy, collected in a capital or a court,

have been known to contest with virulence those frivolous
privileges which depend on the caprice of fashion or the will
of their master. These persons then displayed towards each
other precisely the same puerile jealousies which animate the
men of democracies, the same eagerness to snatch the small-
est advantages which their equals contested, and the same
desire to parade ostentatiously those of which they were in
possession. If national pride ever entered into the minds of
courtiers, I do not question that they would display it in the
same manner as the members of a democratic community.

Chapter XVII: That the Aspect of Society in the United
States Is at Once Excited and Monotonous

It would seem that nothing can be more adapted to stimu-
late and to feed curiosity than the aspect of the United States.
Fortunes, opinions, and laws are there in ceaseless variation:
it is as if immutable nature herself were mutable, such are
the changes worked upon her by the hand of man. Yet in the
end the sight of this excited community becomes monoto-
nous, and after having watched the moving pageant for a

time the spectator is tired of it. Amongst aristocratic nations
every man is pretty nearly stationary in his own sphere; but
men are astonishingly unlike each other – their passions, their
notions, their habits, and their tastes are essentially different:
nothing changey, but everything differs. In democracies, on
the contrary, all men are alike and do things pretty nearly alike.
It is true that they are subject to great and frequent vicissi-
tudes; but as the same events of good or adverse fortune are
continually recurring, the name of the actors only is changed,
the piece is always the same. The aspect of American society is
animated, because men and things are always changing; but it
is monotonous, because all these changes are alike.
Men living in democratic ages have many passions, but
most of their passions either end in the love of riches or pro-
ceed from it. The cause of this is, not that their souls are
narrower, but that the importance of money is really greater
at such times. When all the members of a community are
independent of or indifferent to each other, the co-opera-
tion of each of them can only be obtained by paying for it:
this infinitely multiplies the purposes to which wealth may
be applied, and increases its value. When the reverence which

not, though they see not, though they know not each other;
and they will be surprised at length to find themselves all
collected on the same spot. All the nations which take, not
any particular man, but man himself, as the object of their
researches and their imitations, are tending in the end to a
similar state of society, like these travellers converging to the
central plot of the forest.

Book Three – Chapter XVIII

Chapter XVIII: Of Honor in the United States and in
Democratic Communities

It would seem that men employ two very distinct methods
in the public estimation* of the actions of their fellowmen;
at one time they judge them by those simple notions of right
and wrong which are diffused all over the world; at another
they refer their decision to a few very special notions which
belong exclusively to some particular age and country. It of-
ten happens that these two rules differ; they sometimes con-
flict: but they are never either entirely identified or entirely
annulled by one another. Honor, at the periods of its great-

*The word “honor” is not always used in the same sense
either in French or English. I. It first signifies the dignity,
glory, or reverence which a man receives from his kind; and
in this sense a man is said to acquire honor. 2. Honor signi-
fies the aggregate of those rules by the assistance of which
this dignity, glory, or reverence is obtained. Thus we say that
a man has always strictly obeyed the laws of honor; or a man
has violated his honor. In this chapter the word is always
used in the latter sense.

why it was so deeply severed from the remainder of the na-
tion, or what founded and consolidated its power. I take its
existence as an established fact, and I am endeavoring to ac-
count for the peculiar view which it took of the greater part
of human actions. The first thing that strikes me is, that in
the feudal world actions were not always praised or blamed
with reference to their intrinsic worth, but that they were
sometimes appreciated exclusively with reference to the per-
son who was the actor or the object of them, which is repug-
nant to the general conscience of mankind. Thus some of
the actions which were indifferent on the part of a man in
humble life, dishonored a noble; others changed their whole
character according as the person aggrieved by them belonged
or did not belong to the aristocracy. When these different
notions first arose, the nobility formed a distinct body amidst
the people, which it commanded from the inaccessible heights
where it was ensconced. To maintain this peculiar position,
which constituted its strength, it not only required political
privileges, but it required a standard of right and wrong for
its own especial use. That some particular virtue or vice be-
longed to the nobility rather than to the humble classes -

of antiquity – I mean patriotism; the word itself is not of
very ancient date in the language.* Feudal institutions con-
cealed the country at large from men’s sight, and rendered
the love of it less necessary. The nation was forgotten in the
passions which attached men to persons. Hence it was no
part of the strict law of feudal honor to remain faithful to
one’s country. Not indeed that the love of their country did
not exist in the hearts of our forefathers; but it constituted a
dim and feeble instinct, which has grown more clear and
strong in proportion as aristocratic classes have been abol-
ished, and the supreme power of the nation centralized. This
may be clearly seen from the contrary judgments which Eu-
ropean nations have passed upon the various events of their
histories, according to the generations by which such judg-
ments have been formed. The circumstance which most dis-
honored the Constable de Bourbon in the eyes of his con-
temporaries was that he bore arms against his king: that which
most dishonors him in our eyes, is that he made war against
his country; we brand him as deeply as our forefathers did,
but for different reasons.
*Even the word “patrie” was not used by the French writers
until the sixteenth century.

Any nation would furnish us with similar grounds of ob-
servation; for, as I have already remarked, whenever men
collect together as a distinct community, the notion of honor
instantly grows up amongst them; that is to say, a system of
opinions peculiar to themselves as to what is blamable or
commendable; and these peculiar rules always originate in
the special habits and special interests of the community.
This is applicable to a certain extent to democratic commu-
nities as well as to others, as we shall now proceed to prove
by the example of the Americans.* Some loose notions of
the old aristocratic honor of Europe are still to be found
scattered amongst the opinions of the Americans; but these
traditional opinions are few in number, they have but little
root in the country, and but little power. They are like a
religion which has still some temples left standing, though
men have ceased to believe in it. But amidst these half-oblit-
erated notions of exotic honor, some new opinions have
sprung up, which constitute what may be termed in our days
American honor. I have shown how the Americans are con-

slavery does not exist; they alone can be said to present a
complete picture of democratic society.

ever be established, and it is almost impossible to predict
which actions will be held in honor and which will be thought
disgraceful. Such times are wretched, but they are of short
duration.
As honor, amongst democratic nations, is imperfectly de-
fined, its influence is of course less powerful; for it is diffi-
cult to apply with certainty and firmness a law which is not
distinctly known. Public opinion, the natural and supreme
interpreter of the laws of honor, not clearly discerning to
which side censure or approval ought to lean, can only pro-
nounce a hesitating judgment. Sometimes the opinion of
the public may contradict itself; more frequently it does not
act, and lets things pass.
The weakness of the sense of honor in democracies also
arises from several other causes. In aristocratic countries, the
same notions of honor are always entertained by only a few
persons, always limited in number, often separated from the
rest of their fellow-citizens. Honor is easily mingled and iden-
tified in their minds with the idea of all that distinguishes
their own position; it appears to them as the chief character-
istic of their own rank; they apply its different rules with all

successively disappear: the notion of honor no longer pro-
ceeds from any other source than the wants peculiar to the
nation at large, and it denotes the individual character of
that nation to the world. Lastly, if it be allowable to suppose
that all the races of mankind should be commingled, and
that all the peoples of earth should ultimately come to have
the same interests, the same wants, undistinguished from
each other by any characteristic peculiarities, no conventional
value whatever would then be attached to men’s actions; they
would all be regarded by all in the same light; the general
necessities of mankind, revealed by conscience to every man,
would become the common standard. The simple and gen-
eral notions of right and wrong only would then be recog-
nized in the world, to which, by a natural and necessary tie,
the idea of censure or approbation would be attached. Thus,
to comprise all my meaning in a single proposition, the dis-
similarities and inequalities of men gave rise to the notion of
honor; that notion is weakened in proportion as these dif-
ferences are obliterated, and with them it would disappear.

Book Three – Chapters XIX – XXI

Chapter XIX: Why So Many Ambitious Men and So Little
Lofty Ambition Are to Be Found in the United States

The first thing which strikes a traveller in the United States
is the innumerable multitude of those who seek to throw off
their original condition; and the second is the rarity of lofty
ambition to be observed in the midst of the universally am-
bitious stir of society. No Americans are devoid of a yearning
desire to rise; but hardly any appear to entertain hopes of
great magnitude, or to drive at very lofty aims. All are con-
stantly seeking to acquire property, power, and reputation –
few contemplate these things upon a great scale; and this is
the more surprising, as nothing is to be discerned in the
manners or laws of America to limit desire, or to prevent it
from spreading its impulses in every direction. It seems diffi-
cult to attribute this singular state of things to the equality
of social conditions; for at the instant when that same equal-
ity was established in France, the flight of ambition became
unbounded. Nevertheless, I think that the principal cause

men cohere once more; the level of the community is per-
manently determined, and democratic society established.
A democratic nation, arrived at this permanent and regular
state of things, will present a very different spectacle from
that which we have just described; and we may readily con-
clude that, if ambition becomes great whilst the conditions
of society are growing equal, it loses that quality when they
have grown so. As wealth is subdivided and knowledge dif-
fused, no one is entirely destitute of education or of prop-
erty; the privileges and disqualifications of caste being abol-
ished, and men having shattered the bonds which held them
fixed, the notion of advancement suggests itself to every mind,
the desire to rise swells in every heart, and all men want to
mount above their station: ambition is the universal feeling.
But if the equality of conditions gives some resources to all
the members of the community, it also prevents any of them
from having resources of great extent, which necessarily cir-
cumscribes their desires within somewhat narrow limits. Thus
amongst democratic nations ambition is ardent and con-
tinual, but its aim is not habitually lofty; and life is generally
spent in eagerly coveting small objects which are within reach.

order still buoy him up for some time above his fortune. An-
other thing which prevents the men of democratic periods
from easily indulging in the pursuit of lofty objects, is the
lapse of time which they foresee must take place before they
can be ready to approach them. “It is a great advantage,” says
Pascal, “to be a man of quality, since it brings one man as
forward at eighteen or twenty as another man would be at
fifty, which is a clear gain of thirty years.” Those thirty years
are commonly wanting to the ambitious characters of democ-
racies. The principle of equality, which allows every man to
arrive at everything, prevents all men from rapid advancement.
In a democratic society, as well as elsewhere, there are only
a certain number of great fortunes to be made; and as the
paths which lead to them are indiscriminately open to all,
the progress of all must necessarily be slackened. As the can-
didates appear to be nearly alike, and as it is difficult to make
a selection without infringing the principle of equality, which
is the supreme law of democratic societies, the first idea which
suggests itself is to make them all advance at the same rate
and submit to the same probation. Thus in proportion as
men become more alike, and the principle of equality is more

ciple of equality makes the passion for physical gratifications
and the exclusive love of the present predominate in the hu-
man heart: these different propensities mingle with the sen-
timent of ambition, and tinge it, as it were, with their hues.
I believe that ambitious men in democracies are less engrossed
than any others with the interests and the judgment of poster-
ity; the present moment alone engages and absorbs them. They
are more apt to complete a number of undertakings with ra-
pidity than to raise lasting monuments of their achievements;
and they care much more for success than for fame. What
they most ask of men is obedience – what they most covet is
empire. Their manners have in almost all cases remained be-
low the height of their station; the consequence is that they
frequently carry very low tastes into their extraordinary for-
tunes, and that they seem to have acquired the supreme power
only to minister to their coarse or paltry pleasures.
I think that in our time it is very necessary to cleanse, to
regulate, and to adapt the feeling of ambition, but that it
would be extremely dangerous to seek to impoverish and to
repress it over-much. We should attempt to lay down certain
extreme limits, which it should never be allowed to outstep;

with low desires, without daring to embark in lofty enter-
prises, of which he scarcely dreams. Thus, far from thinking
that humility ought to be preached to our contemporaries, I
would have endeavors made to give them a more enlarged
idea of themselves and of their kind. Humility is unwhole-
some to them; what they most want is, in my opinion, pride.
I would willingly exchange several of our small virtues for
this one vice.

Chapter XX: The Trade of Place-Hunting in Certain
Democratic Countries

In the United States as soon as a man has acquired some
education and pecuniary resources, he either endeavors to
get rich by commerce or industry, or he buys land in the
bush and turns pioneer. All that he asks of the State is not to
be disturbed in his toil, and to be secure of his earnings.
Amongst the greater part of European nations, when a man
begins to feel his strength and to extend his desires, the first
thing that occurs to him is to get some public employment.
These opposite effects, originating in the same cause, de-

I shall not remark that the universal and inordinate desire
for place is a great social evil; that it destroys the spirit of
independence in the citizen, and diffuses a venal and servile
humor throughout the frame of society; that it stifles the
manlier virtues: nor shall I be at the pains to demonstrate
that this kind of traffic only creates an unproductive activity,
which agitates the country without adding to its resources: all
these things are obvious. But I would observe, that a govern-
ment which encourages this tendency risks its own tranquil-
lity, and places its very existence in great jeopardy. I am aware
that at a time like our own, when the love and respect which
formerly clung to authority are seen gradually to decline, it
may appear necessary to those in power to lay a closer hold on
every man by his own interest, and it may seem convenient to
use his own passions to keep him in order and in silence; but
this cannot be so long, and what may appear to be a source of
strength for a certain time will assuredly become in the end a
great cause of embarrassment and weakness.
Amongst democratic nations, as well as elsewhere, the num-
ber of official appointments has in the end some limits; but
amongst those nations, the number of aspirants is unlim-

ited; it perpetually increases, with a gradual and irresistible
rise in proportion as social conditions become more equal,
and is only checked by the limits of the population. Thus,
when public employments afford the only outlet for ambi-
tion, the government necessarily meets with a permanent op-
position at last; for it is tasked to satisfy with limited means
unlimited desires. It is very certain that of all people in the
world the most difficult to restrain and to manage are a people
of solicitants. Whatever endeavors are made by rulers, such a
people can never be contented; and it is always to be appre-
hended that they will ultimately overturn the constitution of
the country, and change the aspect of the State, for the sole
purpose of making a clearance of places. The sovereigns of the
present age, who strive to fix upon themselves alone all those
novel desires which are aroused by equality, and to satisfy them,
will repent in the end, if I am not mistaken, that they ever
embarked in this policy: they will one day discover that they
have hazarded their own power, by making it so necessary;
and that the more safe and honest course would have been to
teach their subjects the art of providing for themselves.*
*As a matter of fact, more recent experience has shown that
place-hunting is quite as intense in the United States as in

any country in Europe. It is regarded by the Americans them-
selves as one of the great evils of their social condition, and it
powerfully affects their political institutions. But the Ameri-
can who seeks a place seeks not so much a means of subsis-
tence as the distinction which office and public employment
confer. In the absence of any true aristocracy, the public ser-
vice creates a spurious one, which is as much an object of
ambition as the distinctions of rank in aristocratic countries.

Chapter XXI: Why Great Revolutions Will Become More
Rare

A people which has existed for centuries under a system of
castes and classes can only arrive at a democratic state of
society by passing through a long series of more or less criti-
cal transformations, accomplished by violent efforts, and af-
ter numerous vicissitudes; in the course of which, property,
opinions, and power are rapidly transferred from one hand
to another. Even after this great revolution is consummated,
the revolutionary habits engendered by it may long be traced,
and it will be followed by deep commotion. As all this takes
place at the very time at which social conditions are becom-
ing more equal, it is inferred that some concealed relation
and secret tie exist between the principle of equality itself
and revolution, insomuch that the one cannot exist without
giving rise to the other.
On this point reasoning may seem to lead to the same
result as experience. Amongst a people whose ranks are nearly

lapse into it again. Hence they do not form a distinct class,
which may be easily marked out and plundered; and, more-
over, as they are connected with the mass of their fellow-
citizens by a thousand secret ties, the people cannot assail
them without inflicting an injury upon itself. Between these
two extremes of democratic communities stand an innumer-
able multitude of men almost alike, who, without being ex-
actly either rich or poor, are possessed of sufficient property
to desire the maintenance of order, yet not enough to excite
envy. Such men are the natural enemies of violent commo-
tions: their stillness keeps all beneath them and above them
still, and secures the balance of the fabric of society. Not
indeed that even these men are contented with what they
have gotten, or that they feel a natural abhorrence for a revo-
lution in which they might share the spoil without sharing
the calamity; on the contrary, they desire, with unexampled
ardor, to get rich, but the difficulty is to know from whom
riches can be taken. The same state of society which con-
stantly prompts desires, restrains these desires within neces-
sary limits: it gives men more liberty of changing and less
interest in change.

Not only are the men of democracies not naturally desir-
ous of revolutions, but they are afraid of them. All revolu-
tions more or less threaten the tenure of property: but most
of those who live in democratic countries are possessed of
property - not only are they possessed of property, but they
live in the condition of men who set the greatest store upon
their property. If we attentively consider each of the classes
of which society is composed, it is easy to see that the pas-
sions engendered by property are keenest and most tena-
cious amongst the middle classes. The poor often care but
little for what they possess, because they suffer much more
from the want of what they have not, than they enjoy the
little they have. The rich have many other passions besides
that of riches to satisfy; and, besides, the long and arduous
enjoyment of a great fortune sometimes makes them in the
end insensible to its charms. But the men who have a com-
petency, alike removed from opulence and from penury, at-
tach an enormous value to their possessions. As they are still
almost within the reach of poverty, they see its privations
near at hand, and dread them; between poverty and them-
selves there is nothing but a scanty fortune, upon which they

will arise in democratic communities, whose unbounded as-
pirations cannot be contented by following the beaten track.
Such men like revolutions and hail their approach; but they
have great difficulty in bringing them about, unless unwonted
events come to their assistance. No man can struggle with
advantage against the spirit of his age and country; and, how-
ever powerful he may be supposed to be, he will find it diffi-
cult to make his contemporaries share in feelings and opin-
ions which are repugnant to t all their feelings and desires.
It is a mistake to believe that, when once the equality of
conditions has become the old and uncontested state of so-
ciety, and has imparted its characteristics to the manners of a
nation, men will easily allow themselves to be thrust into
perilous risks by an imprudent leader or a bold innovator.
Not indeed that they will resist him openly, by well-con-
trived schemes, or even by a premeditated plan of resistance.
They will not struggle energetically against him, sometimes
they will even applaud him -but they do not follow him. To
his vehemence they secretly oppose their inertia; to his revo-
lutionary tendencies their conservative interests; their homely
tastes to his adventurous passions; their good sense to the

lief; they frequently entertain doubts which no one, in their
eyes, can remove. It sometimes happens at such times that
the human mind would willingly change its position; but as
nothing urges or guides it forwards, it oscillates to and fro
without progressive motion.*
*If I inquire what state of society is most favorable to the
great revolutions of the mind, I find that it occurs some-
where between the complete equality of the whole commu-
nity and the absolute separation of ranks. Under a system of
castes generations succeed each other without altering men’s
positions; some have nothing more, others nothing better,
to hope for. The imagination slumbers amidst this universal
silence and stillness, and the very idea of change fades from
the human mind. When ranks have been abolished and so-
cial conditions are almost equalized, all men are in ceaseless
excitement, but each of them stands alone, independent and
weak. This latter state of things is excessively different from
the former one; yet it has one point of analogy – great revo-
lutions of the human mind seldom occur in it. But between
these two extremes of the history of nations is an intermedi-
ate period - a period as glorious as it is agitated – when the
conditions of men are not sufficiently settled for the mind to
be lulled in torpor, when they are sufficiently unequal for
men to exercise a vast power on the minds of one another,
and when some few may modify the convictions of all. It is
at such times that great reformers start up, and new opinions
suddenly change the face of the world.

This circumstance is extraordinarily favorable to the stabil-
ity of opinions. When an opinion has taken root amongst a
democratic people, and established itself in the minds of the
bulk of the community, it afterwards subsists by itself and is
maintained without effort, because no one attacks it. Those
who at first rejected it as false, ultimately receive it as the gen-
eral impression; and those who still dispute it in their hearts,
conceal their dissent; they are careful not to engage in a dan-
gerous and useless conflict. It is true, that when the majority
of a democratic people change their opinions, they may sud-
denly and arbitrarily effect strange revolutions in men’s minds;
but their opinions do not change without much difficulty,
and it is almost as difficult to show that they are changed.
Time, events, or the unaided individual action of the mind,
will sometimes undermine or destroy an opinion, without
any outward sign of the change. It has not been openly as-
sailed, no conspiracy has been formed to make war on it, but
its followers one by one noiselessly secede – day by day a few
of them abandon it, until last it is only professed by a minor-
ity. In this state it will still continue to prevail. As its enemies
remain mute, or only interchange their thoughts by stealth,

they are themselves unaware for a long period that a great
revolution has actually been effected; and in this state of un-
certainly they take no steps -they observe each other and are
silent. The majority have ceased to believe what they be-
lieved before; but they still affect to believe, and this empty
phantom of public opinion in strong enough to chill inno-
vators, and to keep them silent and at respectful distance.
We live at a time which has witnessed the most rapid changes
of opinion in the minds of men; nevertheless it may be that
the leading opinions of society will ere long be more settled
than they have been for several centuries in our history: that
time is not yet come, but it may perhaps be approaching. As
I examine more closely the natural wants and tendencies of
democratic nations, I grow persuaded that if ever social equal-
ity is generally and permanently established in the world,
great intellectual and political revolutions will become more
difficult and less frequent than is supposed. Because the men
of democracies appear always excited, uncertain, eager,
changeable in their wills and in their positions, it is imag-
ined that they are suddenly to abrogate their laws, to adopt
new opinions, and to assume new manners. But if the prin-

to revolution, and so refuse to move altogether for fear of
being moved too far. I dread, and I confess it, lest they should
at last so entirely give way to a cowardly love of present en-
joyment, as to lose sight of the interests of their future selves
and of those of their descendants; and to prefer to glide along
the easy current of life, rather than to make, when it is nec-
essary, a strong and sudden effort to a higher purpose. It is
believed by some that modern society will be ever changing
its aspect; for myself, I fear that it will ultimately be too in-
variably fixed in the same institutions, the same prejudices,
the same manners, so that mankind will be stopped and cir-
cumscribed; that the mind will swing backwards and for-
wards forever, without begetting fresh ideas; that man will
waste his strength in bootless and solitary trifling; and, though
in continual motion, that humanity will cease to advance.

Chapter XXII: Why Democratic Nations Are Naturally
Desirous of Peace, and Democratic Armies of War

The same interests, the same fears, the same passions which
deter democratic nations from revolutions, deter them also

in society almost always depends on his rank in the army.
Amongst democratic nations it often happens that an officer
has no property but his pay, and no distinction but that of
military honors: consequently as often as his duties change,
his fortune changes, and he becomes, as it were, a new man.
What was only an appendage to his position in aristocratic
armies, has thus become the main point, the basis of his whole
condition. Under the old French monarchy officers were al-
ways called by their titles of nobility; they are now always called
by the title of their military rank. This little change in the
forms of language suffices to show that a great revolution has
taken place in the constitution of society and in that of the
army. In democratic armies the desire of advancement is al-
most universal: it is ardent, tenacious, perpetual; it is strength-
ened by all other desires, and only extinguished with life itself.
But it is easy to see, that of all armies in the world, those in
which advancement must be slowest in time of peace are the
armies of democratic countries. As the number of commis-
sions is naturally limited, whilst the number of competitors is
almost unlimited, and as the strict law of equality is over all
alike, none can make rapid progress – many can make no

progress at all. Thus the desire of advancement is greater, and
the opportunities of advancement fewer, there than elsewhere.
All the ambitious spirits of a democratic army are consequently
ardently desirous of war, because war makes vacancies, and
warrants the violation of that law of seniority which is the sole
privilege natural to democracy.
We thus arrive at this singular consequence, that of all
armies those most ardently desirous of war are democratic
armies, and of all nations those most fond of peace are demo-
cratic nations: and, what makes these facts still more extraor-
dinary, is that these contrary effects are produced at the same
time by the principle of equality.
All the members of the community, being alike, constantly
harbor the wish, and discover the possibility, of changing
their condition and improving their welfare: this makes them
fond of peace, which is favorable to industry, and allows ev-
ery man to pursue his own little undertakings to their comple-
tion. On the other hand, this same equality makes soldiers
dream of fields of battle, by increasing the value of military
honors in the eyes of those who follow the profession of arms,
and by rendering those honors accessible to all. In either

inveterate diseases to which democratic communities are li-
able. War has great advantages, but we must not flatter our-
selves that it can diminish the danger I have just pointed out.
That peril is only suspended by it, to return more fiercely when
the war is over; for armies are much more impatient of peace
after having tasted military exploits. War could only be a rem-
edy for a people which should always be athirst for military
glory. I foresee that all the military rulers who may rise up in
great democratic nations, will find it easier to conquer with
their armies, than to make their armies live at peace after con-
quest. There are two things which a democratic people will
always find very difficult – to begin a war, and to end it.
Again, if war has some peculiar advantages for democratic
nations, on the other hand it exposes them to certain dan-
gers which aristocracies have no cause to dread to an equal
extent. I shall only point out two of these. Although war
gratifies the army, it embarrasses and often exasperates that
countless multitude of men whose minor passions every day
require peace in order to be satisfied. Thus there is some risk
of its causing, under another form, the disturbance it is in-
tended to prevent. No protracted war can fail to endanger

tion of law and right, would defeat its object: it would do
much more to favor, than to defeat, the establishment of
military tyranny.
After all, and in spite of all precautions, a large army amidst
a democratic people will always be a source of great danger;
the most effectual means of diminishing that danger would
be to reduce the army, but this is a remedy which all nations
have it not in their power to use.

Book Three – Chapters XXIII – XVI

Chapter XXIII: Which Is the Most Warlike and Most
Revolutionary Class in Democratic Armies?

It is a part of the essence of a democratic army to be very
numerous in proportion to the people to which it belongs,
as I shall hereafter show. On the other hand, men living in
democratic times seldom choose a military life. Democratic
nations are therefore soon led to give up the system of vol-
untary recruiting for that of compulsory enlistment. The
necessity of their social condition compels them to resort to
the latter means, and it may easily be foreseen that they will
all eventually adopt it. When military service is compulsory,
the burden is indiscriminately and equally borne by the whole
community. This is another necessary consequence of the
social condition of these nations, and of their notions. The
government may do almost whatever it pleases, provided it
appeals to the whole community at once: it is the unequal
distribution of the weight, not the weight itself, which com-
monly occasions resistance. But as military service is com-

of the army, rises or sinks with it, and henceforward directs
all his hopes to that quarter only. As the wants of an officer
are distinct from those of the country, he may perhaps ar-
dently desire war, or labor to bring about a revolution at the
very moment when the nation is most desirous of stability
and peace. There are, nevertheless, some causes which allay
this restless and warlike spirit. Though ambition is universal
and continual amongst democratic nations, we have seen
that it is seldom great. A man who, being born in the lower
classes of the community, has risen from the ranks to be an
officer, has already taken a prodigious step. He has gained a
footing in a sphere above that which he filled in civil life,
and he has acquired rights which most democratic nations
will ever consider as inalienable.* He is willing to pause after
so great an effort, and to enjoy what he has won. The fear of
risking what he has already obtained damps the desire of
acquiring what he has not got. Having conquered the first
*The position of officers is indeed much more secure amongst
democratic nations than elsewhere; the lower the personal
standing of the man, the greater is the comparative impor-
tance of his military grade, and the more just and necessary
is it that the enjoyment of that rank should be secured by
the laws.

and greatest impediment which opposed his advancement,
he resigns himself with less impatience to the slowness of his
progress. His ambition will be more and more cooled in pro-
portion as the increasing distinction of his rank teaches him
that he has more to put in jeopardy. If I am not mistaken, the
least warlike, and also the least revolutionary part, of a demo-
cratic army, will always be its chief commanders.
But the remarks I have just made on officers and soldiers
are not applicable to a numerous class which in all armies
fills the intermediate space between them - I mean the class
of non-commissioned officers. This class of non-commis-
sioned officers which have never acted a part in history until
the present century, is henceforward destined, I think, to
play one of some importance. Like the officers, non-com-
missioned officers have broken, in their minds, all the ties
which bound them to civil life; like the former, they devote
themselves permanently to the service, and perhaps make it
even more exclusively the object of all their desires: but non-
commissioned officers are men who have not yet reached a
firm and lofty post at which they may pause and breathe
more freely, ere they can attain further promotion. By the

ignorant and weak, they will allow themselves to be drawn
by their leaders into disturbances, either unconsciously or
against their will; if it is enlightened and energetic, the com-
munity will itself keep them within the bounds of order.

Chapter XXIV: Causes Which Render Democratic
Armies Weaker Than Other Armies at the Outset of a
Campaign, and More Formidable in Protracted Warfare

Any army is in danger of being conquered at the outset of a
campaign, after a long peace; any army which has long been
engaged in warfare has strong chances of victory: this truth
is peculiarly applicable to democratic armies. In aristocracies
the military profession, being a privileged career, is held in
honor even in time of peace. Men of great talents, great at-
tainments, and great ambition embrace it; the army is in all
respects on a level with the nation, and frequently above it.
We have seen, on the contrary, that amongst a democratic
people the choicer minds of the nation are gradually drawn
away from the military profession, to seek by other paths,
distinction, power, and especially wealth. After a long peace

self to the harder toils and sterner duties of warfare; and if he
has not absolutely lost the taste for arms, at least he has as-
sumed a mode of life which unfits him for conquest.
Amongst aristocratic nations, the ease of civil life exercises
less influence on the manners of the army, because amongst
those nations the aristocracy commands the army: and an
aristocracy, however plunged in luxurious pleasures, has al-
ways many other passions besides that of its own well-being,
and to satisfy those passions more thoroughly its well-being
will be readily sacrificed.*

I have shown that in democratic armies, in time of peace,
promotion is extremely slow. The officers at first support
this state of things with impatience, they grow excited, rest-
less, exasperated, but in the end most of them make up their
minds to it. Those who have the largest share of ambition
and of resources quit the army; others, adapting their tastes
and their desires to their scanty fortunes, ultimately look
upon the military profession in a civil point of view. The
quality they value most in it is the competency and security
which attend it: their whole notion of the future rests upon

*See Appendix V.

tocracy solely, but of the whole country, are drawn in this
direction. As the number of competitors for military honors
is immense, and war drives every man to his proper level,
great generals are always sure to spring up. A long war pro-
duces upon a democratic army the same effects that a revo-
lution produces upon a people; it breaks through regulations,
and allows extraordinary men to rise above the common level.
Those officers whose bodies and minds have grown old in
peace, are removed, or superannuated, or they die. In their
stead a host of young men are pressing on, whose frames are
already hardened, whose desires are extended and inflamed
by active service. They are bent on advancement at all haz-
ards, and perpetual advancement; they are followed by oth-
ers with the same passions and desires, and after these are
others yet unlimited by aught but the size of the army. The
principle of equality opens the door of ambition to all, and
death provides chances for ambition. Death is constantly
thinning the ranks, making vacancies, closing and opening
the career of arms.
There is moreover a secret connection between the mili-
tary character and the character of democracies, which war

brings to light. The men of democracies are naturally pas-
sionately eager to acquire what they covet, and to enjoy it on
easy conditions. They for the most part worship chance, and
are much less afraid of death than of difficulty. This is the
spirit which they bring to commerce and manufactures; and
this same spirit, carried with them to the field of battle, in-
duces them willingly to expose their lives in order to secure
in a moment the rewards of victory. No kind of greatness is
more pleasing to the imagination of a democratic people than
military greatness – a greatness of vivid and sudden lustre,
obtained without toil, by nothing but the risk of life. Thus,
whilst the interests and the tastes of the members of a demo-
cratic community divert them from war, their habits of mind
fit them for carrying on war well; they soon make good sol-
diers, when they are roused from their business and their
enjoyments. If peace is peculiarly hurtful to democratic
armies, war secures to them advantages which no other armies
ever possess; and these advantages, however little felt at first,
cannot fail in the end to give them the victory. An aristo-
cratic nation, which in a contest with a democratic people
does not succeed in ruining the latter at the outset of the
war, always runs a great risk of being conquered by it.

Chapter XXV: Of Discipline in Democratic Armies

It is a very general opinion, especially in aristocratic coun-
tries, that the great social equality which prevails in democ-
racies ultimately renders the private soldier independent of
the officer, and thus destroys the bond of discipline. This is
a mistake, for there are two kinds of discipline, which it is
important not to confound. When the officer is noble and
the soldier a serf – one rich, the other poor – the former
educated and strong, the latter ignorant and weak – the strict-
est bond of obedience may easily be established between the
two men. The soldier is broken in to military discipline, as it
were, before he enters the army; or rather, military discipline
is nothing but an enhancement of social servitude. In aristo-
cratic armies the soldier will soon become insensible to ev-
erything but the orders of his superior officers; he acts with-
out reflection, triumphs without enthusiasm, and dies with-
out complaint: in this state he is no longer a man, but he is
still a most formidable animal trained for war.
A democratic people must despair of ever obtaining from
soldiers that blind, minute, submissive, and invariable obe-

dience which an aristocratic people may impose on them
without difficulty. The state of society does not prepare them
for it, and the nation might be in danger of losing its natural
advantages if it sought artificially to acquire advantages of
this particular kind. Amongst democratic communities, mili-
tary discipline ought not to attempt to annihilate the free
spring of the faculties; all that can be done by discipline is to
direct it; the obedience thus inculcated is less exact, but it is
more eager and more intelligent. It has its root in the will of
him who obeys: it rests not only on his instinct, but on his
reason; and consequently it will often spontaneously become
more strict as danger requires it. The discipline of an aristo-
cratic army is apt to be relaxed in war, because that disci-
pline is founded upon habits, and war disturbs those habits.
The discipline of a democratic army on the contrary is
strengthened in sight of the enemy, because every soldier
then clearly perceives that he must be silent and obedient in
order to conquer.
The nations which have performed the greatest warlike
achievements knew no other discipline than that which I
speak of. Amongst the ancients none were admitted into the

armies but freemen and citizens, who differed but little from
one another, and were accustomed to treat each other as
equals. In this respect it may be said that the armies of antiq-
uity were democratic, although they came out of the bosom
of aristocracy; the consequence was that in those armies a
sort of fraternal familiarity prevailed between the officers and
the men. Plutarch’s lives of great commanders furnish con-
vincing instances of the fact: the soldiers were in the con-
stant habit of freely addressing their general, and the general
listened to and answered whatever the soldiers had to say:
they were kept in order by language and by example, far
more than by constraint or punishment; the general was as
much their companion as their chief. I know not whether
the soldiers of Greece and Rome ever carried the minutiae of
military discipline to the same degree of perfection as the
Russians have done; but this did not prevent Alexander from
conquering Asia – and Rome, the world.

Chapter XXVI: Some Considerations on War in Demo-
cratic Communities

When the principle of equality is in growth, not only amongst
a single nation, but amongst several neighboring nations at
the same time, as is now the case in Europe, the inhabitants
of these different countries, notwithstanding the dissimilar-
ity of language, of customs, and of laws, nevertheless resemble
each other in their equal dread of war and their common
love of peace.* It is in vain that ambition or anger puts arms
in the hands of princes; they are appeased in spite of them-
selves by a species of general apathy and goodwill, which
makes the sword drop from their grasp, and wars become
more rare. As the spread of equality, taking place in several
countries at once, simultaneously impels their various in-

habitants to follow manufactures and commerce, not only do
their tastes grow alike, but their interests are so mixed and
entangled with one another that no nation can inflict evils on
other nations without those evils falling back upon itself; and
all nations ultimately regard war as a calamity, almost as severe
to the conqueror as to the conquered. Thus, on the one hand,
it is extremely difficult in democratic ages to draw nations
into hostilities; but on the other hand, it is almost impossible
that any two of them should go to war without embroiling the
rest. The interests of all are so interlaced, their opinions and
their wants so much alike, that none can remain quiet when
the others stir. Wars therefore become more rare, but when
they break out they spread over a larger field. Neighboring
democratic nations not only become alike in some respects,
but they eventually grow to resemble each other in almost
all.* This similitude of nations has consequences of great im-
portance in relation to war.
*This is not only because these nations have the same social
condition, but it arises from the very nature of that social
condition which leads men to imitate and identify them-
selves with each other. When the members of a community
are divided into castes and classes, they not only differ from
one another, but they have no taste and no desire to be alike;

*It is scarcely necessary for me to observe that the dread of
war displayed by the nations of Europe is not solely attribut-
able to the progress made by the principle of equality amongst
them; independently of this permanent cause several other
accidental causes of great weight might be pointed out, and
I may mention before all the rest the extreme lassitude which
the wars of the Revolution and the Empire have left behind
them.

on the contrary, everyone endeavors, more and more, to keep
his own opinions undisturbed, to retain his own peculiar hab-
its, and to remain himself. The characteristics of individuals
are very strongly marked. When the state of society amongst a
people is democratic – that is to say, when there are no longer
any castes or classes in the community, and all its members are
nearly equal in education and in property – the human mind
follows the opposite direction. Men are much alike, and they
are annoyed, as it were, by any deviation from that likeness:
far from seeking to preserve their own distinguishing
singularities, they endeavor to shake them off, in order to iden-
tify themselves with the general mass of the people, which is
the sole representative of right and of might to their eyes. The
characteristics of individuals are nearly obliterated. In the ages
of aristocracy even those who are naturally alike strive to cre-
ate imaginary differences between themselves: in the ages of
democracy even those who are not alike seek only to become
so, and to copy each other – so strongly is the mind of every
man always carried away by the general impulse of mankind.
Something of the same kind may be observed between na-
tions: two nations having the same aristocratic social condi-
tion, might remain thoroughly distinct and extremely differ-
ent, because the spirit of aristocracy is to retain strong indi-
vidual characteristics; but if two neighboring nations have the
same democratic social condition, they cannot fail to adopt
similar opinions and manners, because the spirit of democ-
racy tends to assimilate men to each other.

If I inquire why it is that the Helvetic Confederacy made
the greatest and most powerful nations of Europe tremble in
the fifteenth century, whilst at the present day the power of
that country is exactly proportioned to its population, I per-
ceive that the Swiss are become like all the surrounding com-
munities, and those surrounding communities like the Swiss:
so that as numerical strength now forms the only difference
between them, victory necessarily attends the largest army.
Thus one of the consequences of the democratic revolution
which is going on in Europe is to make numerical strength
preponderate on all fields of battle, and to constrain all small
nations to incorporate themselves with large States, or at least
to adopt the policy of the latter. As numbers are the deter-
mining cause of victory, each people ought of course to strive
by all the means in its power to bring the greatest possible
number of men into the field. When it was possible to enlist
a kind of troops superior to all others, such as the Swiss in-
fantry or the French horse of the sixteenth century, it was
not thought necessary to raise very large armies; but the case
is altered when one soldier is as efficient as another.
The same cause which begets this new want also supplies

is the population unable to carry on hostilities, but it may be
apprehended that they will not be inclined to attempt it. In
accordance with the law of nations adopted in civilized coun-
tries, the object of wars is not to seize the property of private
individuals, but simply to get possession of political power.
The destruction of private property is only occasionally re-
sorted to for the purpose of attaining the latter object. When
an aristocratic country is invaded after the defeat of its army,
the nobles, although they are at the same time the wealthiest
members of the community, will continue to defend them-
selves individually rather than submit; for if the conqueror
remained master of the country, he would deprive them of
their political power, to which they cling even more closely
than to their property. They therefore prefer fighting to sub-
jection, which is to them the greatest of all misfortunes; and
they readily carry the people along with them because the
people has long been used to follow and obey them, and
besides has but little to risk in the war. Amongst a nation in
which equality of conditions prevails, each citizen, on the
contrary, has but slender share of political power, and often
has no share at all; on the other hand, all are independent,

stands, which can better be done by a single blow than by a
war; for as soon as there is a regular war, the party which rep-
resents the State is always certain to conquer. The only case in
which a civil war could arise is, if the army should divide itself
into two factions, the one raising the standard of rebellion,
the other remaining true to its allegiance. An army constitutes
a small community, very closely united together, endowed with
great powers of vitality, and able to supply its own wants for
some time. Such a war might be bloody, but it could not be
long; for either the rebellious army would gain over the gov-
ernment by the sole display of its resources, or by its first vic-
tory, and then the war would be over; or the struggle would
take place, and then that portion of the army which should
not be supported by the organized powers of the State would
speedily either disband itself or be destroyed. It may therefore
be admitted as a general truth, that in ages of equality civil
wars will become much less frequent and less protracted.*
*It should be borne in mind that I speak here of sovereign
and independent democratic nations, not of confederate
democracies; in confederacies, as the preponderating power
always resides, in spite of all political fictions, in the state
governments, and not in the federal government, civil wars
are in fact nothing but foreign wars in disguise.

Influence of Democratic Opinions on Political Society

Chapter I: That Equality Naturally Gives Men a Taste
for Free Institutions

I should imperfectly fulfil the purpose of this book, if, after
having shown what opinions and sentiments are suggested
by the principle of equality, I did not point out, ere I con-
clude, the general influence which these same opinions and
sentiments may exercise upon the government of human
societies. To succeed in this object I shall frequently have to
retrace my steps; but I trust the reader will not refuse to
follow me through paths already known to him, which may
lead to some new truth.
The principle of equality, which makes men independent
of each other, gives them a habit and a taste for following, in
their private actions, no other guide but their own will. This
complete independence, which they constantly enjoy towards
their equals and in the intercourse of private life, tends to

men straight to independence, and may suddenly drive them
into anarchy; the other conducts them by a longer, more
secret, but more certain road, to servitude. Nations readily
discern the former tendency, and are prepared to resist it;
they are led away by the latter, without perceiving its drift;
hence it is peculiarly important to point it out. For myself, I
am so far from urging as a reproach to the principle of equal-
ity that it renders men untractable, that this very circum-
stance principally calls forth my approbation. I admire to
see how it deposits in the mind and heart of man the dim
conception and instinctive love of political independence,
thus preparing the remedy for the evil which it engenders; it
is on this very account that I am attached to it.

Chapter II: That the Notions of Democratic Nations on
Government Are Naturally Favorable to the Concentra-
tion of Power

The notion of secondary powers, placed between the sover-
eign and his subjects, occurred naturally to the imagination
of aristocratic nations, because those communities contained

adopted them. Most of these parties censure the conduct of
the government, but they all hold that the government ought
perpetually to act and interfere in everything that is done.
Even those which are most at variance are nevertheless agreed
upon this head. The unity, the ubiquity, the omnipotence of
the supreme power, and the uniformity of its rules, constitute
the principal characteristics of all the political systems which
have been put forward in our age. They recur even in the wildest
visions of political regeneration: the human mind pursues them
in its dreams. If these notions spontaneously arise in the minds
of private individuals, they suggest themselves still more forc-
ibly to the minds of princes. Whilst the ancient fabric of Eu-
ropean society is altered and dissolved, sovereigns acquire new
conceptions of their opportunities and their duties; they learn
for the first time that the central power which they represent
may and ought to administer by its own agency, and on a
uniform plan, all the concerns of the whole community. This
opinion, which, I will venture to say, was never conceived be-
fore our time by the monarchs of Europe, now sinks deeply
into the minds of kings, and abides there amidst all the agita-
tion of more unsettled thoughts.

Our contemporaries are therefore much less divided than is
commonly supposed; they are constantly disputing as to the
hands in which supremacy is to be vested, but they readily agree
upon the duties and the rights of that supremacy. The notion
they all form of government is that of a sole, simple, providen-
tial, and creative power. All secondary opinions in politics are
unsettled; this one remains fixed, invariable, and consistent. It
is adopted by statesmen and political philosophers; it is eagerly
laid hold of by the multitude; those who govern and those who
are governed agree to pursue it with equal ardor: it is the fore-
most notion of their minds, it seems inborn. It originates there-
fore in no caprice of the human intellect, but it is a necessary
condition of the present state of mankind.

Chapter III: That the Sentiments of Democratic Nations
Accord with Their Opinions in Leading Them to Con-
centrate Political Power

If it be true that, in ages of equality, men readily adopt the
notion of a great central power, it cannot be doubted on the
other hand that their habits and sentiments predispose them

to recognize such a power and to give it their support. This
may be demonstrated in a few words, as the greater part of
the reasons, to which the fact may be attributed, have been
previously stated.* As the men who inhabit democratic coun-
tries have no superiors, no inferiors, and no habitual or nec-
essary partners in their undertakings, they readily fall back
upon themselves and consider themselves as beings apart. I
had occasion to point this out at considerable length in treat-
ing of individualism. Hence such men can never, without an
effort, tear themselves from their private affairs to engage in
public business; their natural bias leads them to abandon the
latter to the sole visible and permanent representative of the
interests of the community, that is to say, to the State. Not
only are they naturally wanting in a taste for public business,
but they have frequently no time to attend to it. Private life
is so busy in democratic periods, so excited, so full of wishes
and of work, that hardly any energy or leisure remains to
each individual for public life. I am the last man to contend
that these propensities are unconquerable, since my chief
object in writing this book has been to combat them. I only

*See Appendix W.

mote the influence of the central power without intending
it. Democratic ages are periods of experiment, innovation,
and adventure. At such times there are always a multitude of
men engaged in difficult or novel undertakings, which they
follow alone, without caring for their fellowmen. Such per-
sons may be ready to admit, as a general principle, that the
public authority ought not to interfere in private concerns;
but, by an exception to that rule, each of them craves for its
assistance in the particular concern on which he is engaged,
and seeks to draw upon the influence of the government for
his own benefit, though he would restrict it on all other oc-
casions. If a large number of men apply this particular ex-
ception to a great variety of different purposes, the sphere of
the central power extends insensibly in all directions, although
each of them wishes it to be circumscribed. Thus a demo-
cratic government increases its power simply by the fact of
its permanence. Time is on its side; every incident befriends
it; the passions of individuals unconsciously promote it; and
it may be asserted, that the older a democratic community
is, the more centralized will its government become.

The hatred which men bear to privilege increases in propor-
tion as privileges become more scarce and less considerable,
so that democratic passions would seem to burn most fiercely
at the very time when they have least fuel. I have already
given the reason of this phenomenon. When all conditions
are unequal, no inequality is so great as to offend the eye;
whereas the slightest dissimilarity is odious in the midst of
general uniformity: the more complete is this uniformity,
the more insupportable does the sight of such a difference
become. Hence it is natural that the love of equality should
constantly increase together with equality itself, and that it
should grow by what it feeds upon. This never-dying, ever-
kindling hatred, which sets a democratic people against the
smallest privileges, is peculiarly favorable to the gradual con-
centration of all political rights in the hands of the represen-
tative of the State alone. The sovereign, being necessarily
and incontestably above all the citizens, excites not their envy,
and each of them thinks that he strips his equals of the pre-
rogative which he concedes to the crown. The man of a demo-
cratic age is extremely reluctant to obey his neighbor who is
his equal; he refuses to acknowledge in such a person ability

superior to his own; he mistrusts his justice, and is jealous of
his power; he fears and he contemns him; and he loves con-
tinually to remind him of the common dependence in which
both of them stand to the same master. Every central power
which follows its natural tendencies courts and encourages
the principle of equality; for equality singularly facilitates,
extends, and secures the influence of a central power.
In like manner it may be said that every central govern-
ment worships uniformity: uniformity relieves it from in-
quiry into an infinite number of small details which must be
attended to if rules were to be adapted to men, instead of
indiscriminately subjecting men to rules: thus the govern-
ment likes what the citizens like, and naturally hates what
they hate. These common sentiments, which, in democratic
nations, constantly unite the sovereign and every member of
the community in one and the same conviction, establish a
secret and lasting sympathy between them. The faults of the
government are pardoned for the sake of its tastes; public
confidence is only reluctantly withdrawn in the midst even
of its excesses and its errors, and it is restored at the first call.
Democratic nations often hate those in whose hands the cen-

tral power is vested; but they always love that power itself.
Thus, by two separate paths, I have reached the same con-
clusion. I have shown that the principle of equality suggests
to men the notion of a sole, uniform, and strong govern-
ment: I have now shown that the principle of equality im-
parts to them a taste for it. To governments of this kind the
nations of our age are therefore tending. They are drawn
thither by the natural inclination of mind and heart; and in
order to reach that result, it is enough that they do not check
themselves in their course. I am of opinion, that, in the demo-
cratic ages which are opening upon us, individual indepen-
dence and local liberties will ever be the produce of artificial
contrivance; that centralization will be the natural form of
government*

*See Appendix X.

Chapter IV: Of Certain Peculiar and Accidental Causes
Which Either Lead a People to Complete Centralization
of Government, or Which Divert Them from It

If all democratic nations are instinctively led to the central-
ization of government, they tend to this result in an unequal
manner. This depends on the particular circumstances which
may promote or prevent the natural consequences of that
state of society - circumstances which are exceedingly nu-
merous; but I shall only advert to a few of them. Amongst
men who have lived free long before they became equal, the
tendencies derived from free institutions combat, to a cer-
tain extent, the propensities superinduced by the principle
of equality; and although the central power may increase its
privileges amongst such a people, the private members of
such a community will never entirely forfeit their indepen-
dence. But when the equality of conditions grows up amongst
a people which has never known, or has long ceased to know,
what freedom is (and such is the case upon the Continent of
Europe), as the former habits of the nation are suddenly com-
bined, by some sort of natural attraction, with the novel habits

and principles engendered by the state of society, all powers
seem spontaneously to rush to the centre. These powers ac-
cumulate there with astonishing rapidity, and the State in-
stantly attains the utmost limits of its strength, whilst pri-
vate persons allow themselves to sink as suddenly to the low-
est degree of weakness.
The English who emigrated three hundred years ago to
found a democratic commonwealth on the shores of the New
World, had all learned to take a part in public affairs in their
mother-country; they were conversant with trial by jury; they
were accustomed to liberty of speech and of the press - to
personal freedom, to the notion of rights and the practice of
asserting them. They carried with them to America these
free institutions and manly customs, and these institutions
preserved them against the encroachments of the State. Thus
amongst the Americans it is freedom which is old - equality
is of comparatively modern date. The reverse is occurring in
Europe, where equality, introduced by absolute power and
under the rule of kings, was already infused into the habits
of nations long before freedom had entered into their con-
ceptions.

rived from the aristocracy of England the notion of private
rights and the taste for local freedom; and they have been
able to retain both the one and the other, because they have
had no aristocracy to combat.
If at all times education enables men to defend their inde-
pendence, this is most especially true in democratic ages.
When all men are alike, it is easy to found a sole and all-
powerful government, by the aid of mere instinct. But men
require much intelligence, knowledge, and art to organize
and to maintain secondary powers under similar circum-
stances, and to create amidst the independence and indi-
vidual weakness of the citizens such free associations as may
be in a condition to struggle against tyranny without de-
stroying public order.
Hence the concentration of power and the subjection of
individuals will increase amongst democratic nations, not
only in the same proportion as their equality, but in the same
proportion as their ignorance. It is true, that in ages of im-
perfect civilization the government is frequently as wanting
in the knowledge required to impose a despotism upon the
people as the people are wanting in the knowledge required

pal cause still remains to be noticed. The foremost of the inci-
dental causes which may draw the management of all affairs
into the hands of the ruler in democratic countries, is the ori-
gin of that ruler himself, and his own propensities. Men who
live in the ages of equality are naturally fond of central power,
and are willing to extend its privileges; but if it happens that
this same power faithfully represents their own interests, and
exactly copies their own inclinations, the confidence they place
in it knows no bounds, and they think that whatever they
bestow upon it is bestowed upon themselves.
The attraction of administrative powers to the centre will
always be less easy and less rapid under the reign of kings
who are still in some way connected with the old aristocratic
order, than under new princes, the children of their own
achievements, whose birth, prejudices, propensities, and hab-
its appear to bind them indissolubly to the cause of equality.
I do not mean that princes of aristocratic origin who live in
democratic ages do not attempt to centralize; I believe they
apply themselves to that object as diligently as any others.
For them, the sole advantages of equality lie in that direc-
tion; but their opportunities are less great, because the com-

munity, instead of volunteering compliance with their de-
sires, frequently obeys them with reluctance. In democratic
communities the rule is that centralization must increase in
proportion as the sovereign is less aristocratic. When an an-
cient race of kings stands at the head of an aristocracy, as the
natural prejudices of the sovereign perfectly accord with the
natural prejudices of the nobility, the vices inherent in aris-
tocratic communities have a free course, and meet with no
corrective. The reverse is the case when the scion of a feudal
stock is placed at the head of a democratic people. The sov-
ereign is constantly led, by his education, his habits, and his
associations, to adopt sentiments suggested by the inequal-
ity of conditions, and the people tend as constantly, by their
social condition, to those manners which are engendered by
equality. At such times it often happens that the citizens seek
to control the central power far less as a tyrannical than as an
aristocratical power, and that they persist in the firm defence
of their independence, not only because they would remain
free, but especially because they are determined to remain
equal. A revolution which overthrows an ancient regal fam-
ily, in order to place men of more recent growth at the head

of a democratic people, may temporarily weaken the central
power; but however anarchical such a revolution may ap-
pear at first, we need not hesitate to predict that its final and
certain consequence will be to extend and to secure the pre-
rogatives of that power. The foremost or indeed the sole con-
dition which is required in order to succeed in centralizing
the supreme power in a democratic community, is to love
equality, or to get men to believe you love it. Thus the sci-
ence of despotism, which was once so complex, is simpli-
fied, and reduced as it were to a single principle.

Book Four – Chapter V

Chapter V: That Amongst the European Nations of Our
Time the Power of Governments Is Increasing, Although
the Persons Who Govern Are Less Stable

On reflecting upon what has already been said, the reader
will be startled and alarmed to find that in Europe every-
thing seems to conduce to the indefinite extension of the
prerogatives of government, and to render all that enjoyed
the rights of private independence more weak, more subor-
dinate, and more precarious. The democratic nations of Eu-
rope have all the general and permanent tendencies which
urge the Americans to the centralization of government, and
they are moreover exposed to a number of secondary and
incidental causes with which the Americans are unacquainted.
It would seem as if every step they make towards equality
brings them nearer to despotism. And indeed if we do but
cast our looks around, we shall be convinced that such is the
fact. During the aristocratic ages which preceded the present
time, the sovereigns of Europe had been deprived of, or had
relinquished, many of the rights inherent in their power. Not

a hundred years ago, amongst the greater part of European
nations, numerous private persons and corporations were suf-
ficiently independent to administer justice, to raise and main-
tain troops, to levy taxes, and frequently even to make or in-
terpret the law. The State has everywhere resumed to itself
alone these natural attributes of sovereign power; in all mat-
ters of government the State tolerates no intermediate agent
between itself and the people, and in general business it di-
rects the people by its own immediate influence. I am far from
blaming this concentration of power, I simply point it out.
At the same period a great number of secondary powers
existed in Europe, which represented local interests and ad-
ministered local affairs. Most of these local authorities have
already disappeared; all are speedily tending to disappear, or
to fall into the most complete dependence. From one end of
Europe to the other the privileges of the nobility, the liber-
ties of cities, and the powers of provincial bodies, are either
destroyed or upon the verge of destruction. Europe has en-
dured, in the course of the last half- century, many revolu-
tions and counter-revolutions which have agitated it in op-
posite directions: but all these perturbations resemble each
other in one respect -they have all shaken or destroyed the
secondary powers of government. The local privileges which
the French did not abolish in the countries they conquered,
have finally succumbed to the policy of the princes who con-
quered the French. Those princes rejected all the innova-
tions of the French Revolution except centralization: that is

the only principle they consented to receive from such a
source. My object is to remark, that all these various rights,
which have been successively wrested, in our time, from
classes, corporations, and individuals, have not served to raise
new secondary powers on a more democratic basis, but have
uniformly been concentrated in the hands of the sovereign.
Everywhere the State acquires more and more direct control
over the humblest members of the community, and a more
exclusive power of governing each of them in his smallest
concerns.* Almost all the charitable establishments of Eu-
*This gradual weakening of individuals in relation to society
at large may be traced in a thousand ways. I shall select from
amongst these examples one derived from the law of wills. In
aristocracies it is common to profess the greatest reverence for
the last testamentary dispositions of a man; this feeling some-
times even became superstitious amongst the older nations of
Europe: the power of the State, far from interfering with the
caprices of a dying man, gave full force to the very least of
them, and insured to him a perpetual power. When all living
men are enfeebled, the will of the dead is less respected: it is
circumscribed within a narrow range, beyond which it is an-
nulled or checked by the supreme power of the laws. In the
Middle Ages, testamentary power had, so to speak, no limits:
amongst the French at the present day, a man cannot distrib-
ute his fortune amongst his children without the interference
of the State; after having domineered over a whole life, the law
insists upon regulating the very last act of it.

rope were formerly in the hands of private persons or of cor-
porations; they are now almost all dependent on the supreme
government, and in many countries are actually adminis-
tered by that power. The State almost exclusively undertakes
to supply bread to the hungry, assistance and shelter to the
sick, work to the idle, and to act as the sole reliever of all
kinds of misery. Education, as well as charity, is become in
most countries at the present day a national concern. The
State receives, and often takes, the child from the arms of
the mother, to hand it over to official agents: the State un-
dertakes to train the heart and to instruct the mind of each
generation. Uniformity prevails in the courses of public in-
struction as in everything else; diversity, as well as freedom,
is disappearing day by day. Nor do I hesitate to affirm, that
amongst almost all the Christian nations of our days, Catholic
as well as Protestant, religion is in danger of falling into the
hands of the government. Not that rulers are over-jealous of
the right of settling points of doctrine, but they get more
and more hold upon the will of those by whom doctrines are
expounded; they deprive the clergy of their property, and
pay them by salaries; they divert to their own use the influ-
ence of the priesthood, they make them their own ministers

– often their own servants - and by this alliance with religion
they reach the inner depths of the soul of man.*

But this is as yet only one side of the picture. The author-
ity of government has not only spread, as we have just seen,
throughout the sphere of all existing powers, till that sphere
can no longer contain it, but it goes further, and invades the
domain heretofore reserved to private independence. A mul-
titude of actions, which were formerly entirely beyond the
control of the public administration, have been subjected to
that control in our time, and the number of them is con-
stantly increasing. Amongst aristocratic nations the supreme
government usually contented itself with managing and su-
perintending the community in whatever directly and os-
tensibly concerned the national honor; but in all other re-

*In proportion as the duties of the central power are aug-
mented, the number of public officers by whom that power
is represented must increase also. They form a nation in each
nation; and as they share the stability of the government,
they more and more fill up the place of an aristocracy.
In almost every part of Europe the government rules in
two ways; it rules one portion of the community by the fear
which they entertain of its agents, and the other by the hope
they have of becoming its agents.

spects the people were left to work out their own free will.
Amongst these nations the government often seemed to for-
get that there is a point at which the faults and the sufferings
of private persons involve the general prosperity, and that to
prevent the ruin of a private individual must sometimes be a
matter of public importance. The democratic nations of our
time lean to the opposite extreme. It is evident that most of
our rulers will not content themselves with governing the
people collectively: it would seem as if they thought them-
selves responsible for the actions and private condition of their
subjects – as if they had undertaken to guide and to instruct
each of them in the various incidents of life, and to secure
their happiness quite independently of their own consent. On
the other hand private individuals grow more and more apt to
look upon the supreme power in the same light; they invoke
its assistance in all their necessities, and they fix their eyes upon
the administration as their mentor or their guide.
I assert that there is no country in Europe in which the
public administration has not become, not only more cen-
tralized, but more inquisitive and more minute it everywhere
interferes in private concerns more than it did; it regulates

more undertakings, and undertakings of a lesser kind; and it
gains a firmer footing every day about, above, and around all
private persons, to assist, to advise, and to coerce them. For-
merly a sovereign lived upon the income of his lands, or the
revenue of his taxes; this is no longer the case now that his
wants have increased as well as his power. Under the same
circumstances which formerly compelled a prince to put on
a new tax, he now has recourse to a loan. Thus the State
gradually becomes the debtor of most of the wealthier mem-
bers of the community, and centralizes the largest amounts
of capital in its own hands. Small capital is drawn into its
keeping by another method. As men are intermingled and
conditions become more equal, the poor have more resources,
more education, and more desires; they conceive the notion
of bettering their condition, and this teaches them to save.
These savings are daily producing an infinite number of small
capitals, the slow and gradual produce of labor, which are
always increasing. But the greater part of this money would
be unproductive if it remained scattered in the hands of its
owners. This circumstance has given rise to a philanthropic
institution, which will soon become, if I am not mistaken,
one of our most important political institutions. Some chari-

table persons conceived the notion of collecting the savings
of the poor and placing them out at interest. In some coun-
tries these benevolent associations are still completely dis-
tinct from the State; but in almost all they manifestly tend
to identify themselves with the government; and in some of
them the government has superseded them, taking upon it-
self the enormous task of centralizing in one place, and put-
ting out at interest on its own responsibility, the daily sav-
ings of many millions of the working classes. Thus the State
draws to itself the wealth of the rich by loans, and has the
poor man’s mite at its disposal in the savings banks. The
wealth of the country is perpetually flowing around the gov-
ernment and passing through its hands; the accumulation
increases in the same proportion as the equality of condi-
tions; for in a democratic country the State alone inspires
private individuals with confidence, because the State alone
appears to be endowed with strength and durability.* Thus

the sovereign does not confine himself to the management
of the public treasury; he interferes in private money mat-
ters; he is the superior, and often the master, of all the mem-
bers of the community; and, in addition to this, he assumes
the part of their steward and paymaster.
The central power not only fulfils of itself the whole of the
duties formerly discharged by various authorities – extend-
ing those duties, and surpassing those authorities – but it
performs them with more alertness, strength, and indepen-
dence than it displayed before. All the governments of Eu-
rope have in our time singularly improved the science of ad-
ministration: they do more things, and they do everything
with more order, more celerity, and at less expense; they seem
to be constantly enriched by all the experience of which they
have stripped private persons. From day to day the princes
of Europe hold their subordinate officers under stricter con-
trol, and they invent new methods for guiding them more
closely, and inspecting them with less trouble. Not content
with managing everything by their agents, they undertake
to manage the conduct of their agents in everything; so that
the public administration not only depends upon one and

*On the one hand the taste for worldly welfare is perpetually
increasing, and on the other the government gets more and
more complete possession of the sources of that welfare. Thus
men are following two separate roads to servitude: the taste
for their own welfare withholds them from taking a part in
the government, and their love of that welfare places them
in closer dependence upon those who govern.

the same power, but it is more and more confined to one
spot and concentrated in the same hands. The government
centralizes its agency whilst it increases its prerogative - hence
a twofold increase of strength.
In examining the ancient constitution of the judicial power,
amongst most European nations, two things strike the mind
- the independence of that power, and the extent of its func-
tions. Not only did the courts of justice decide almost all
differences between private persons, but in very many cases
they acted as arbiters between private persons and the State.
I do not here allude to the political and administrative of-
fices which courts of judicature had in some countries
usurped, but the judicial office common to them all. In most
of the countries of Europe, there were, and there still are,
many private rights, connected for the most part with the
general right of property, which stood under the protection
of the courts of justice, and which the State could not violate
without their sanction. It was this semi-political power which
mainly distinguished the European courts of judicature from
all others; for all nations have had judges, but all have not
invested their judges with the same privileges. Upon exam-
ining what is now occurring amongst the democratic nations
of Europe which are called free, as well as amongst the others,
it will be observed that new and more dependent courts are

everywhere springing up by the side of the old ones, for the
express purpose of deciding, by an extraordinary jurisdiction,
such litigated matters as may arise between the government
and private persons. The elder judicial power retains its inde-
pendence, but its jurisdiction is narrowed; and there is a grow-
ing tendency to reduce it to be exclusively the arbiter between
private interests. The number of these special courts of justice
is continually increasing, and their functions increase likewise.
Thus the government is more and more absolved from the
necessity of subjecting its policy and its rights to the sanction
of another power. As judges cannot be dispensed with, at least
the State is to select them, and always to hold them under its
control; so that, between the government and private indi-
viduals, they place the effigy of justice rather than justice it-
self. The State is not satisfied with drawing all concerns to
itself, but it acquires an ever-increasing power of deciding on
them all without restriction and without appeal.*
*A strange sophism has been made on this head in France.
When a suit arises between the government and a private
person, it is not to be tried before an ordinary judge - in
order, they say, not to mix the administrative and the judi-
cial powers; as if it were not to mix those powers, and to mix
them in the most dangerous and oppressive manner, to in-
vest the government with the office of judging and adminis-
tering at the same time.

property was therefore surrounded by ample securities, and
its possessors enjoyed great independence. This gave rise to
laws and customs which have been perpetuated, notwith-
standing the subdivision of lands and the ruin of the nobil-
ity; and, at the present time, landowners and agriculturists
are still those amongst the community who must easily es-
cape from the control of the supreme power. In these same
aristocratic ages, in which all the sources of our history are to
be traced, personal property was of small importance, and
those who possessed it were despised and weak: the manu-
facturing class formed an exception in the midst of those
aristocratic communities; as it had no certain patronage, it
was not outwardly protected, and was often unable to pro-
tect itself.
Hence a habit sprung up of considering manufacturing
property as something of a peculiar nature, not entitled to
the same deference, and not worthy of the same securities as
property in general; and manufacturers were looked upon as
a small class in the bulk of the people, whose independence
was of small importance, and who might with propriety be
abandoned to the disciplinary passions of princes. On glanc-
ing over the codes of the middle ages, one is surprised to see,

in those periods of personal independence, with what inces-
sant royal regulations manufactures were hampered, even in
their smallest details: on this point centralization was as ac-
tive and as minute as it can ever be. Since that time a great
revolution has taken place in the world; manufacturing prop-
erty, which was then only in the germ, has spread till it cov-
ers Europe: the manufacturing class has been multiplied and
enriched by the remnants of all other ranks; it has grown
and is still perpetually growing in number, in importance, in
wealth. Almost all those who do not belong to it are con-
nected with it at least on some one point; after having been
an exception in society, it threatens to become the chief, if
not the only, class; nevertheless the notions and political pre-
cedents engendered by it of old still cling about it. These
notions and these precedents remain unchanged, because they
are old, and also because they happen to be in perfect accor-
dance with the new notions and general habits of our con-
temporaries. Manufacturing property then does not extend
its rights in the same ratio as its importance. The manufac-
turing classes do not become less dependent, whilst they
become more numerous; but, on the contrary, it would seem
as if despotism lurked within them, and naturally grew with
their growth.* As a nation becomes more engaged in manu-
factures, the want of roads, canals, harbors, and other works
of a semi-public nature, which facilitate the acquisition of
wealth, is more strongly felt; and as a nation becomes more
democratic, private individuals are less able, and the State more

able, to execute works of such magnitude. I do not hesitate to
assert that the manifest tendency of all governments at the
present time is to take upon themselves alone the execution of
these undertakings; by which means they daily hold in closer
dependence the population which they govern.
*I shall quote a few facts in corroboration of this remark. Mines
are the natural sources of manufacturing wealth: as manufactures
have grown up in Europe, as the produce of mines has become of
more general importance, and good mining more difficult from
the subdivision of property which is a consequence of the equality
of conditions, most governments have asserted a right of owning
the soil in which the mines lie, and of inspecting the works; which
has never been the case with any other kind of property. Thus
mines, which were private property, liable to the same obligations
and sheltered by the same guarantees as all other landed property,
have fallen under the control of the State. The State either works
them or farms them; the owners of them are mere tenants, deriv-
ing their rights from the State; and, moreover, the State almost
everywhere claims the power of directing their operations: it lays
down rules, enforces the adoption of particular methods, subjects
the mining adventurers to constant superintendence, and, if re-
fractory, they are ousted by a government court of justice, and the
government transfers their contract to other hands; so that the
government not only possesses the mines, but has all the adven-
turers in its power. Nevertheless, as manufactures increase, the
working of old mines increases also; new ones are opened, the
mining population extends and grows up; day by day governments
augment their subterranean dominions, and people them with
their agents.

continually weakening the supreme power, the other as con-
tinually strengthening it: at no other period in our history
has it appeared so weak or so strong. But upon a more atten-
tive examination of the state of the world, it appears that
these two revolutions are intimately connected together, that
they originate in the same source, and that after having fol-
lowed a separate course, they lead men at last to the same
result. I may venture once more to repeat what I have al-
ready said or implied in several parts of this book: great care
must be taken not to confound the principle of equality it-
self with the revolution which finally establishes that prin-
ciple in the social condition and the laws of a nation: here
lies the reason of almost all the phenomena which occasion
our astonishment. All the old political powers of Europe,
the greatest as well as the least, were founded in ages of aris-
tocracy, and they more or less represented or defended the
principles of inequality and of privilege. To make the novel
wants and interests, which the growing principle of equality
introduced, preponderate in government, our contemporar-
ies had to overturn or to coerce the established powers. This
led them to make revolutions, and breathed into many of

Book Four – Chapters VI,VII

Chapter VI: What Sort of Despotism Democratic Na-
tions Have to Fear

I had remarked during my stay in the United States, that a
democratic state of society, similar to that of the Americans,
might offer singular facilities for the establishment of despo-
tism; and I perceived, upon my return to Europe, how much
use had already been made by most of our rulers, of the no-
tions, the sentiments, and the wants engendered by this same
social condition, for the purpose of extending the circle of
their power. This led me to think that the nations of
Christendom would perhaps eventually undergo some sort
of oppression like that which hung over several of the na-
tions of the ancient world. A more accurate examination of
the subject, and five years of further meditations, have not
diminished my apprehensions, but they have changed the
object of them. No sovereign ever lived in former ages so
absolute or so powerful as to undertake to administer by his
own agency, and without the assistance of intermediate pow-

the passions of men are naturally circumscribed - their imagi-
nation limited, their pleasures simple. This universal modera-
tion moderates the sovereign himself, and checks within cer-
tain limits the inordinate extent of his desires.
Independently of these reasons drawn from the nature of
the state of society itself, I might add many others arising
from causes beyond my subject; but I shall keep within the
limits I have laid down to myself. Democratic governments
may become violent and even cruel at certain periods of ex-
treme effervescence or of great danger: but these crises will
be rare and brief. When I consider the petty passions of our
contemporaries, the mildness of their manners, the extent of
their education, the purity of their religion, the gentleness of
their morality, their regular and industrious habits, and the
restraint which they almost all observe in their vices no less
than in their virtues, I have no fear that they will meet with
tyrants in their rulers, but rather guardians.* I think then
that the species of oppression by which democratic nations
are menaced is unlike anything which ever before existed in
the world: our contemporaries will find no prototype of it in

*See Appendix Y.

assume, the latter would assuredly be the worst. When the
sovereign is elective, or narrowly watched by a legislature
which is really elective and independent, the oppression which
he exercises over individuals is sometimes greater, but it is
always less degrading; because every man, when he is op-
pressed and disarmed, may still imagine, that whilst he yields
obedience it is to himself he yields it, and that it is to one of
his own inclinations that all the rest give way. In like manner
I can understand that when the sovereign represents the na-
tion, and is dependent upon the people, the rights and the
power of which every citizen is deprived, not only serve the
head of the State, but the State itself; and that private per-
sons derive some return from the sacrifice of their indepen-
dence which they have made to the public. To create a repre-
sentation of the people in every centralized country, is there-
fore, to diminish the evil which extreme centralization may
produce, but not to get rid of it. I admit that by this means
room is left for the intervention of individuals in the more
important affairs; but it is not the less suppressed in the
smaller and more private ones. It must not be forgotten that
it is especially dangerous to enslave men in the minor details

of life. For my own part, I should be inclined to think free-
dom less necessary in great things than in little ones, if it
were possible to be secure of the one without possessing the
other. Subjection in minor affairs breaks out every day, and
is felt by the whole community indiscriminately. It does not
drive men to resistance, but it crosses them at every turn, till
they are led to surrender the exercise of their will. Thus their
spirit is gradually broken and their character enervated;
whereas that obedience, which is exacted on a few impor-
tant but rare occasions, only exhibits servitude at certain in-
tervals, and throws the burden of it upon a small number of
men. It is in vain to summon a people, which has been ren-
dered so dependent on the central power, to choose from
time to time the representatives of that power; this rare and
brief exercise of their free choice, however important it may
be, will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties
of thinking, feeling, and acting for themselves, and thus
gradually falling below the level of humanity. *b I add that
they will soon become incapable of exercising the great and
only privilege which remains to them. The democratic na-

be a short-lived monster. The vices of rulers and the inepti-
tude of the people would speedily bring about its ruin; and
the nation, weary of its representatives and of itself, would
create freer institutions, or soon return to stretch itself at the
feet of a single master.

Chapter VII: Continuation Of The Preceding Chapters

I believe that it is easier to establish an absolute and despotic
government amongst a people in which the conditions of
society are equal, than amongst any other; and I think that if
such a government were once established amongst such a
people, it would not only oppress men, but would eventu-
ally strip each of them of several of the highest qualities of
humanity. Despotism therefore appears to me peculiarly to
be dreaded in democratic ages. I should have loved freedom,
I believe, at all times, but in the time in which we live I am
ready to worship it. On the other hand, I am persuaded that
all who shall attempt, in the ages upon which we are enter-
ing, to base freedom upon aristocratic privilege, will fail -
that all who shall attempt to draw and to retain authority

sure, or oppressed without remonstrance; and which, by de-
fending its own rights against the encroachments of the gov-
ernment, saves the common liberties of the country.
In periods of aristocracy every man is always bound so
closely to many of his fellow-citizens, that he cannot be as-
sailed without their coming to his assistance. In ages of equal-
ity every man naturally stands alone; he has no hereditary
friends whose co- operation he may demand - no class upon
whose sympathy he may rely: he is easily got rid of, and he is
trampled on with impunity. At the present time, an oppressed
member of the community has therefore only one method
of self-defence - he may appeal to the whole nation; and if
the whole nation is deaf to his complaint, he may appeal to
mankind: the only means he has of making this appeal is by
the press. Thus the liberty of the press is infinitely more valu-
able amongst democratic nations than amongst all others; it
is the only cure for the evils which equality may produce.
Equality sets men apart and weakens them; but the press
places a powerful weapon within every man’s reach, which
the weakest and loneliest of them all may use. Equality de-
prives a man of the support of his connections; but the press

enables him to summon all his fellow- countrymen and all
his fellow-men to his assistance. Printing has accelerated the
progress of equality, and it is also one of its best correctives.
I think that men living in aristocracies may, strictly speak-
ing, do without the liberty of the press: but such is not the
case with those who live in democratic countries. To protect
their personal independence I trust not to great political as-
semblies, to parliamentary privilege, or to the assertion of
popular sovereignty. All these things may, to a certain ex-
tent, be reconciled with personal servitude - but that servi-
tude cannot be complete if the press is free: the press is the
chiefest democratic instrument of freedom.
Something analogous may be said of the judicial power. It
is a part of the essence of judicial power to attend to private
interests, and to fix itself with predilection on minute ob-
jects submitted to its observation; another essential quality
of judicial power is never to volunteer its assistance to the
oppressed, but always to be at the disposal of the humblest
of those who solicit it; their complaint, however feeble they
may themselves be, will force itself upon the ear of justice
and claim redress, for this is inherent in the very constitu-

tion of the courts of justice. A power of this kind is therefore
peculiarly adapted to the wants of freedom, at a time when
the eye and finger of the government are constantly intruding
into the minutest details of human actions, and when private
persons are at once too weak to protect themselves, and too
much isolated for them to reckon upon the assistance of their
fellows. The strength of the courts of law has ever been the
greatest security which can be offered to personal indepen-
dence; but this is more especially the case in democratic ages:
private rights and interests are in constant danger, if the judi-
cial power does not grow more extensive and more strong to
keep pace with the growing equality of conditions.
Equality awakens in men several propensities extremely
dangerous to freedom, to which the attention of the legisla-
tor ought constantly to be directed. I shall only remind the
reader of the most important amongst them. Men living in
democratic ages do not readily comprehend the utility of
forms: they feel an instinctive contempt for them - I have
elsewhere shown for what reasons. Forms excite their con-
tempt and often their hatred; as they commonly aspire to
none but easy and present gratifications, they rush onwards

time at which it would be most necessary to retain and to
defend what little remains of them. It is therefore most espe-
cially in the present democratic ages, that the true friends of
the liberty and the greatness of man ought constantly to be
on the alert to prevent the power of government from lightly
sacrificing the private rights of individuals to the general ex-
ecution of its designs. At such times no citizen is so obscure
that it is not very dangerous to allow him to be oppressed -
no private rights are so unimportant that they can be surren-
dered with impunity to the caprices of a government. The
reason is plain: - if the private right of an individual is vio-
lated at a time when the human mind is fully impressed with
the importance and the sanctity of such rights, the injury
done is confined to the individual whose right is infringed;
but to violate such a right, at the present day, is deeply to
corrupt the manners of the nation and to put the whole com-
munity in jeopardy, because the very notion of this kind of
right constantly tends amongst us to be impaired and lost.
There are certain habits, certain notions, and certain vices
which are peculiar to a state of revolution, and which a pro-
tracted revolution cannot fail to engender and to propagate,

the least foreseen, of all those which futurity holds in store:
but I do not think that they are insurmountable. The men
who live in the democratic ages upon which we are entering
have naturally a taste for independence: they are naturally
impatient of regulation, and they are wearied by the perma-
nence even of the condition they themselves prefer. They are
fond of power; but they are prone to despise and hate those
who wield it, and they easily elude its grasp by their own
mobility and insignificance. These propensities will always
manifest themselves, because they originate in the ground-
work of society, which will undergo no change: for a long
time they will prevent the establishment of any despotism,
and they will furnish fresh weapons to each succeeding gen-
eration which shall struggle in favor of the liberty of man-
kind. Let us then look forward to the future with that salu-
tary fear which makes men keep watch and ward for free-
dom, not with that faint and idle terror which depresses and
enervates the heart.

Book Four – Chapter VIII

Chapter VIII: General Survey of the Subject

Before I close forever the theme that has detained me so long,
I would fain take a parting survey of all the various charac-
teristics of modern society, and appreciate at last the general
influence to be exercised by the principle of equality upon
the fate of mankind; but I am stopped by the difficulty of
the task, and in presence of so great an object my sight is
troubled, and my reason fails. The society of the modern
world which I have sought to delineate, and which I seek to
judge, has but just come into existence. Time has not yet
shaped it into perfect form: the great revolution by which it
has been created is not yet over: and amidst the occurrences
of our time, it is almost impossible to discern what will pass
away with the revolution itself, and what will survive its close.
The world which is rising into existence is still half encum-
bered by the remains of the world which is waning into de-
cay; and amidst the vast perplexity of human affairs, none
can say how much of ancient institutions and former man-

perseded by some mean term, at once less lofty and less low,
less brilliant and less obscure, than what before existed in
the world.
When I survey this countless multitude of beings, shaped
in each other’s likeness, amidst whom nothing rises and noth-
ing falls, the sight of such universal uniformity saddens and
chills me, and I am tempted to regret that state of society
which has ceased to be. When the world was full of men of
great importance and extreme insignificance, of great wealth
and extreme poverty, of great learning and extreme igno-
rance, I turned aside from the latter to fix my observation on
the former alone, who gratified my sympathies. But I admit
that this gratification arose from my own weakness: it is be-
cause I am unable to see at once all that is around me, that I
am allowed thus to select and separate the objects of my
predilection from among so many others. Such is not the
case with that almighty and eternal Being whose gaze neces-
sarily includes the whole of created things, and who surveys
distinctly, though at once, mankind and man. We may natu-
rally believe that it is not the singular prosperity of the few,
but the greater well-being of all, which is most pleasing in

into existence, by notions derived from a state of society which
no longer exists; for as these states of society are exceedingly
different in their structure, they cannot be submitted to a just
or fair comparison. It would be scarcely more reasonable to
require of our own contemporaries the peculiar virtues which
originated in the social condition of their forefathers, since
that social condition is itself fallen, and has drawn into one
promiscuous ruin the good and evil which belonged to it.
But as yet these things are imperfectly understood. I find
that a great number of my contemporaries undertake to make
a certain selection from amongst the institutions, the opin-
ions, and the ideas which originated in the aristocratic con-
stitution of society as it was: a portion of these elements they
would willingly relinquish, but they would keep the remain-
der and transplant them into their new world. I apprehend
that such men are wasting their time and their strength in
virtuous but unprofitable efforts. The object is not to retain
the peculiar advantages which the inequality of conditions
bestows upon mankind, but to secure the new benefits which
equality may supply. We have not to seek to make ourselves
like our progenitors, but to strive to work out that species of

becoming equal; but it depends upon themselves whether
the principle of equality is to lead them to servitude or free-
dom, to knowledge or barbarism, to prosperity or to wretch-
edness.

Part I.

Appendix A

For information concerning all the countries of the West
which have not been visited by Europeans, consult the ac-
count of two expeditions undertaken at the expense of Con-
gress by Major Long. This traveller particularly mentions,
on the subject of the great American desert, that a line may
be drawn nearly parallel to the 20th degree of longitude*
(meridian of Washington), beginning from the Red River
and ending at the River Platte. From this imaginary line to
the Rocky Mountains, which bound the valley of the Missis-
sippi on the west, lie immense plains, which are almost en-
tirely covered with sand, incapable of cultivation, or scat-
tered over with masses of granite. In summer, these plains
are quite destitute of water, and nothing is to be seen on
them but herds of buffaloes and wild horses. Some hordes of
Indians are also found there, but in no great numbers. Ma-

jor Long was told that in travelling northwards from the River
Platte you find the same desert lying constantly on the left;
but he was unable to ascertain the truth of this report. How-
ever worthy of confidence may be the narrative of Major
Long, it must be remembered that he only passed through
the country of which he speaks, without deviating widely
from the line which he had traced out for his journey.

Appendix B

South America, in the region between the tropics, produces an
incredible profusion of climbing plants, of which the flora of
the Antilles alone presents us with forty different species. Among
the most graceful of these shrubs is the passion-flower, which,
according to Descourtiz, grows with such luxuriance in the
Antilles, as to climb trees by means of the tendrils with which it
is provided, and form moving bowers of rich and elegant fes-
toons, decorated with blue and purple flowers, and fragrant with
perfume. The Mimosa scandens (Acacia a grandes gousses) is a
creeper of enormous and rapid growth, which climbs from tree
to tree, and sometimes covers more than half a league.

*The 20th degree of longitude, according to the meridian of
Washington, agrees very nearly with the 97th degree on the
meridian of Greenwich.

Appendix C

The languages which are spoken by the Indians of America,
from the Pole to Cape Horn, are said to be all formed upon
the same model, and subject to the same grammatical rules;
whence it may fairly be concluded that all the Indian nations
sprang from the same stock. Each tribe of the American con-
tinent speaks a different dialect; but the number of languages,
properly so called, is very small, a fact which tends to prove
that the nations of the New World had not a very remote
origin. Moreover, the languages of America have a great de-
gree of regularity, from which it seems probable that the tribes
which employ them had not undergone any great revolutions,
or been incorporated voluntarily or by constraint, with for-
eign nations. For it is generally the union of several languages
into one which produces grammatical irregularities. It is not
long since the American languages, especially those of the
North, first attracted the serious attention of philologists, when
the discovery was made that this idiom of a barbarous people
was the product of a complicated system of ideas and very
learned combinations. These languages were found to be very

rich, and great pains had been taken at their formation to
render them agreeable to the ear. The grammatical system of
the Americans differs from all others in several points, but
especially in the following: –Some nations of Europe, amongst
others the Germans, have the power of combining at pleasure
different expressions, and thus giving a complex sense to cer-
tain words. The Indians have given a most surprising exten-
sion to this power, so as to arrive at the means of connecting a
great number of ideas with a single term. This will be easily
understood with the help of an example quoted by Mr.
Duponceau, in the “Memoirs of the Philosophical Society of
America”: A Delaware woman playing with a cat or a young
dog, says this writer, is heard to pronounce the word
kuligatschis, which is thus composed: k is the sign of the sec-
ond person, and signifies “thou” or “thy”; uli is a part of the
word wulit, which signifies “beautiful,” “pretty”; gat is another
fragment, of the word wichgat, which means “paw”; and, lastly,
schis is a diminutive giving the idea of smallness. Thus in one
word the Indian woman has expressed “Thy pretty little paw.”
Take another example of the felicity with which the savages of
America have composed their words. A young man of Dela-

ware is called pilape. This word is formed from pilsit, “chaste,”
“innocent”; and lenape, “man”; viz., “man in his purity and in-
nocence.” This facility of combining words is most remarkable
in the strange formation of their verbs. The most complex ac-
tion is often expressed by a single verb, which serves to convey
all the shades of an idea by the modification of its construction.
Those who may wish to examine more in detail this subject,
which I have only glanced at superficially, should read: –

Hecwelder relative to the Indian languages, which is to be

cal Society of America,” published at Philadelphia, 1819, by
Abraham Small; vol. i. p. 356-464.

Appendix D

See in Charlevoix, vol. i. p. 235, the history of the first war
which the French inhabitants of Canada carried on, in 1610,
against the Iroquois. The latter, armed with bows and ar-
rows, offered a desperate resistance to the French and their
allies. Charlevoix is not a great painter, yet he exhibits clearly
enough, in this narrative, the contrast between the Euro-
pean manners and those of savages, as well as the different
way in which the two races of men understood the sense of
honor. When the French, says he, seized upon the beaver-
skins which covered the Indians who had fallen, the Hu-
rons, their allies, were greatly offended at this proceeding;
but without hesitation they set to work in their usual man-
ner, inflicting horrid cruelties upon the prisoners, and de-
vouring one of those who had been killed, which made the
Frenchmen shudder. The barbarians prided themselves upon
a scrupulousness which they were surprised at not finding in
our nation, and could not understand that there was less to
reprehend in the stripping of dead bodies than in the de-
vouring of their flesh like wild beasts. Charlevoix, in another

carried them in triumph. At this sight, the women swam to
the canoes, where they received the bloody scalps from the
hands of their husbands, and tied them round their necks.
The warriors offered one of these horrible trophies to
Champlain; they also presented him with some bows and
arrows - the only spoils of the Iroquois which they had ven-
tured to seize - entreating him to show them to the King of
France. Champlain lived a whole winter quite alone among
these barbarians, without being under any alarm for his per-
son or property.

Appendix E

Although the Puritanical strictness which presided over the
establishment of the English colonies in America is now much
relaxed, remarkable traces of it are still found in their habits
and their laws. In 1792, at the very time when the anti-Chris-
tian republic of France began its ephemeral existence, the
legislative body of Massachusetts promulgated the following
law, to compel the citizens to observe the Sabbath. We give
the preamble and the principal articles of this law, which is

no game or recreation shall be used on the Lord’s Day, upon
pain of forfeiting ten shillings.
“That no one shall travel on that day, or any part thereof,
under pain of forfeiting twenty shillings; that no vessel shall
leave a harbour of the colony; that no persons shall keep
outside the meeting-house during the time of public wor-
ship, or profane the time by playing or talking, on penalty of
five shillings.
“Public-houses shall not entertain any other than strang-
ers or lodgers, under penalty of five shillings for every per-
son found drinking and abiding therein.
“Any person in health, who, without sufficient reason, shall
omit to worship God in public during three months, shall
be condemned to a fine of ten shillings.
“Any person guilty of misbehaviour in a place of public
worship, shall be fined from five to forty shillings.
“These laws are to be enforced by the tything-men of each
township, who have authority to visit public-houses on the
Sunday. The innkeeper who shall refuse them admittance,
shall be fined forty shillings for such offence.
“The tything-men are to stop travellers, and require of them

streets at the hour at which you expect men in the middle of
life to be engaged in business, and young people in pleasure;
and you meet with solitude and silence. Not only have all
ceased to work, but they appear to have ceased to exist. Nei-
ther the movements of industry are heard, nor the accents of
joy, nor even the confused murmur which arises from the
midst of a great city. Chains are hung across the streets in the
neighborhood of the churches; the half-closed shutters of
the houses scarcely admit a ray of sun into the dwellings of
the citizens. Now and then you perceive a solitary individual
who glides silently along the deserted streets and lanes. Next
day, at early dawn, the rolling of carriages, the noise of ham-
mers, the cries of the population, begin to make themselves
heard again. The city is awake. An eager crowd hastens to-
wards the resort of commerce and industry; everything
around you bespeaks motion, bustle, hurry. A feverish activ-
ity succeeds to the lethargic stupor of yesterday; you might
almost suppose that they had but one day to acquire wealth
and to enjoy it.

Appendix F

It is unnecessary for me to say, that in the chapter which has
just been read, I have not had the intention of giving a his-
tory of America. My only object was to enable the reader to
appreciate the influence which the opinions and manners of
the first emigrants had exercised upon the fate of the differ-
ent colonies, and of the Union in general. I have therefore
confined myself to the quotation of a few detached frag-
ments. I do not know whether I am deceived, but it appears
to me that, by pursuing the path which I have merely pointed
out, it would be easy to present such pictures of the Ameri-
can republics as would not be unworthy the attention of the
public, and could not fail to suggest to the statesman matter
for reflection. Not being able to devote myself to this labor,
I am anxious to render it easy to others; and, for this pur-
pose, I subjoin a short catalogue and analysis of the works
which seem to me the most important to consult.
At the head of the general documents which it would be
advantageous to examine I place the work entitled “An His-
torical Collection of State Papers, and other authentic Docu-

ments, intended as Materials for a History of the United
States of America,” by Ebenezer Hasard. The first volume of
this compilation, which was printed at Philadelphia in 1792,
contains a literal copy of all the charters granted by the Crown
of England to the emigrants, as well as the principal acts of
the colonial governments, during the commencement of their
existence. Amongst other authentic documents, we here find
a great many relating to the affairs of New England and Vir-
ginia during this period. The second volume is almost en-
tirely devoted to the acts of the Confederation of 1643. This
federal compact, which was entered into by the colonies of
New England with the view of resisting the Indians, was the
first instance of union afforded by the Anglo-Americans.
There were besides many other confederations of the same
nature, before the famous one of 1776, which brought about
the independence of the colonies.
Each colony has, besides, its own historic monuments, some
of which are extremely curious; beginning with Virginia, the
State which was first peopled. The earliest historian of Vir-
ginia was its founder, Captain John Smith. Captain Smith
has left us an octavo volume, entitled “The generall Historie

This book affords some curious details, but I thought it long
and diffuse. The most ancient as well as the best document
to be consulted on the history of Carolina, is a work in small
quarto, entitled “The History of Carolina,” by John Lawson,
printed at London in 1718. This work contains, in the first
part, a journey of discovery in the west of Carolina; the ac-
count of which, given in the form of a journal, is in general
confused and superficial; but it contains a very striking de-
scription of the mortality caused among the savages of that
time both by the smallpox and the immoderate use of brandy;
with a curious picture of the corruption of manners preva-
lent amongst them, which was increased by the presence of
Europeans. The second part of Lawson’s book is taken up
with a description of the physical condition of Carolina, and
its productions. In the third part, the author gives an inter-
esting account of the manners, customs, and government of
the Indians at that period. There is a good deal of talent and
originality in this part of the work. Lawson concludes his
history with a copy of the charter granted to the Carolinas in
the reign of Charles II. The general tone of this work is light,
and often licentious, forming a perfect contrast to the sol-

reprinted at Boston in 1826.
The most valuable and important authority which exists
upon the history of New England, is the work of the Rev.
Cotton Mather, entitled “Magnalia Christi Americana, or
the Ecclesiastical History of New England, 1620-1698, 2
vols. 8vo, reprinted at Hartford, United States, in 1820.”*
The author divided his work into seven books. The first pre-
sents the history of the events which prepared and brought
about the establishment of New England. The second con-
tains the lives of the first governors and chief magistrates
who presided over the country. The third is devoted to the
lives and labors of the evangelical ministers who, during the
same period, had the care of souls. In the fourth the author
relates the institution and progress of the University of Cam-
bridge (Massachusetts). In the fifth he describes the prin-
ciples and the discipline of the Church of New England.
The sixth is taken up in retracing certain facts, which, in the
opinion of Mather, prove the merciful interposition of Provi-
dence in behalf of the inhabitants of New England. Lastly,
in the seventh, the author gives an account of the heresies

*A folio edition of this work was published in London in
1702.

with images full of tender feeling: after having spoken of an
English lady whose religious ardor had brought her to
America with her husband, and who soon after sank under
the fatigues and privations of exile, he adds, “As for her vir-
tuous husband, Isaac Johnson,

He tryed To live without her, liked it not, and dyed.”

Mather’s work gives an admirable picture of the time and
country which he describes. In his account of the motives
which led the Puritans to seek an asylum beyond seas, he
says: – “The God of Heaven served, as it were, a summons
upon the spirits of his people in the English nation, stirring
up the spirits of thousands which never saw the faces of each
other, with a most unanimous inclination to leave all the
pleasant accommodations of their native country, and go over
a terrible ocean, into a more terrible desert, for the pure en-
joyment of all his ordinances. It is now reasonable that, be-
fore we pass any further, the reasons of his undertaking should
be more exactly made known unto posterity, especially unto
the posterity of those that were the undertakers, lest they

come at length to forget and neglect the true interest of New
England. Wherefore I shall now transcribe some of them
from a manuscript, wherein they were then tendered unto
consideration:
“General Considerations for the Plantation of New En-
gland “First, It will be a service unto the Church of great
consequence, to carry the Gospel unto those parts of the
world, and raise a bulwark against the kingdom of Antichrist,
which the Jesuits labour to rear up in all parts of the world.
“Secondly, All other Churches of Europe have been brought
under desolations; and it may be feared that the like judg-
ments are coming upon us; and who knows but God hath
provided this place to be a refuge for many whom he means
to save out of the general destruction?
“Thirdly, The land grows weary of her inhabitants,
insomuch that man, which is the most precious of all crea-
tures, is here more vile and base than the earth he treads
upon; children, neighbours, and friends, especially the poor,
are counted the greatest burdens, which, if things were right,
would be the chiefest of earthly blessings.
“Fourthly, We are grown to that intemperance in all excess

may grow stronger and prosper; but for want of it, may be
put to great hazards, if not be wholly ruined?
“Eighthly, If any such as are known to be godly, and live in
wealth and prosperity here, shall forsake all this to join with
this reformed Church, and with it run the hazard of an hard
and mean condition, it will be an example of great use, both
for the removing of scandal and to give more life unto the
faith of God’s people in their prayers for the plantation, and
also to encourage others to join the more willingly in it.”
Further on, when he declares the principles of the Church
of New England with respect to morals, Mather inveighs
with violence against the custom of drinking healths at table,
which he denounces as a pagan and abominable practice.
He proscribes with the same rigor all ornaments for the hair
used by the female sex, as well as their custom of having the
arms and neck uncovered. In another part of his work he
relates several instances of witchcraft which had alarmed New
England. It is plain that the visible action of the devil in the
affairs of this world appeared to him an incontestable and
evident fact.
This work of Cotton Mather displays, in many places, the

Connecticut during the period given in the title. The author
drew from the best sources, and his narrative bears the stamp
of truth. All that he says of the early days of Connecticut is
extremely curious. See especially the Constitution of 1639,
vol. i. ch. vi. p. 100; and also the Penal Laws of Connecticut,
vol. i. ch. vii. p. 123.
“The History of New Hampshire,” by Jeremy Belknap, is
a work held in merited estimation. It was printed at Boston
in 1792, in 2 vols. 8vo. The third chapter of the first volume
is particularly worthy of attention for the valuable details it
affords on the political and religious principles of the Puri-
tans, on the causes of their emigration, and on their laws.
The following curious quotation is given from a sermon de-
livered in 1663: - “It concerneth New England always to
remember that they are a plantation religious, not a planta-
tion of trade. The profession of the purity of doctrine, wor-
ship, and discipline, is written upon her forehead. Let mer-
chants, and such as are increasing cent. per cent., remember
this, that worldly gain was not the end and design of the
people of New England, but religion. And if any man among
us make religion as twelve, and the world as thirteen, such
an one hath not the spirit of a true New Englishman.” The

reader of Belknap will find in his work more general ideas,
and more strength of thought, than are to be met with in the
American historians even to the present day.
Among the Central States which deserve our attention for
their remote origin, New York and Pennsylvania are the fore-
most. The best history we have of the former is entitled “A
History of New York,” by William Smith, printed at Lon-
don in 1757. Smith gives us important details of the wars
between the French and English in America. His is the best
account of the famous confederation of the Iroquois.
With respect to Pennsylvania, I cannot do better than point
out the work of Proud, entitled “The History of Pennsylva-
nia, from the original Institution and Settlement of that Prov-
ince, under the first Proprietor and Governor, William Penn,
in 1681, till after the year 1742,” by Robert Proud, 2 vols.
8vo, printed at Philadelphia in 1797. This work is deserving
of the especial attention of the reader; it contains a mass of
curious documents concerning Penn, the doctrine of the
Quakers, and the character, manners, and customs of the
first inhabitants of Pennsylvania. I need not add that among
the most important documents relating to this State are the
works of Penn himself, and those of Franklin.

Part II.

Appendix G

We read in Jefferson’s “Memoirs” as follows: –
“At the time of the first settlement of the English in Vir-
ginia, when land was to be had for little or nothing, some
provident persons having obtained large grants of it, and being
desirous of maintaining the splendor of their families, en-
tailed their property upon their descendants. The transmis-
sion of these estates from generation to generation, to men
who bore the same name, had the effect of raising up a dis-
tinct class of families, who, possessing by law the privilege of
perpetuating their wealth, formed by these means a sort of
patrician order, distinguished by the grandeur and luxury of
their establishments. From this order it was that the King
usually chose his councillors of state.”*

In the United States, the principal clauses of the English
law respecting descent have been universally rejected. The

*This passage is extracted and translated from M. Conseil’s
work upon the life of Jefferson, entitled “Melanges Politiques
et Philosophiques de Jefferson.”

Carolina, and Louisiana, entail was never introduced. Those
States which thought proper to preserve the English law of
entail, modified it in such a way as to deprive it of its most
aristocratic tendencies. “Our general principles on the sub-
ject of government,” says Mr. Kent, “tend to favor the free
circulation of property.”
It cannot fail to strike the French reader who studies the
law of inheritance, that on these questions the French legis-
lation is infinitely more democratic even than the American.
The American law makes an equal division of the father’s
property, but only in the case of his will not being known;
“for every man,” says the law, “in the State of New York
(Revised Statutes, vol. iii. Appendix, p. 51), has entire lib-
erty, power, and authority, to dispose of his property by will,
to leave it entire, or divided in favor of any persons he chooses
as his heirs, provided he do not leave it to a political body or
any corporation.” The French law obliges the testator to di-
vide his property equally, or nearly so, among his heirs. Most
of the American republics still admit of entails, under cer-
tain restrictions; but the French law prohibits entail in all
cases. If the social condition of the Americans is more demo-

cratic than that of the French, the laws of the latter are the
most democratic of the two. This may be explained more
easily than at first appears to be the case. In France, democ-
racy is still occupied in the work of destruction; in America,
it reigns quietly over the ruins it has made.

Appendix H

Summary Of The Qualifications Of Voters In The
United States As They Existed In 1832

All the States agree in granting the right of voting at the age
of twenty-one. In all of them it is necessary to have resided
for a certain time in the district where the vote is given. This
period varies from three months to two years.
As to the qualification: in the State of Massachusetts it is
necessary to have an income of Pound 3 or a capital of Pound
60. In Rhode Island, a man must possess landed property to
the amount of $133.
In Connecticut, he must have a property which gives an
income of $17. A year of service in the militia also gives the

elective privilege.
In New Jersey, an elector must have a property of Pound
50 a year.
In South Carolina and Maryland, the elector must possess
fifty acres of land.
In Tennessee, he must possess some property.
In the States of Mississippi, Ohio, Georgia, Virginia, Penn-
sylvania, Delaware, New York, the only necessary qualifica-
tion for voting is that of paying the taxes; and in most of the
States, to serve in the militia is equivalent to the payment of
taxes. In Maine and New Hampshire any man can vote who
is not on the pauper list.
Lastly, in the States of Missouri, Alabama, Illinois, Louisi-
ana, Indiana, Kentucky, and Vermont, the conditions of vot-
ing have no reference to the property of the elector.
I believe there is no other State besides that of North Caro-
lina in which different conditions are applied to the voting
for the Senate and the electing the House of Representa-
tives. The electors of the former, in this case, should possess
in property fifty acres of land; to vote for the latter, nothing
more is required than to pay taxes.

Appendix I

The small number of custom-house officers employed in the
United States, compared with the extent of the coast, ren-
ders smuggling very easy; notwithstanding which, it is less
practised than elsewhere, because everybody endeavors to
repress it. In America there is no police for the prevention of
fires, and such accidents are more frequent than in Europe;
but in general they are more speedily extinguished, because
the surrounding population is prompt in lending assistance.

Appendix K

It is incorrect to assert that centralization was produced by
the French Revolution; the revolution brought it to perfec-
tion, but did not create it. The mania for centralization and
government regulations dates from the time when jurists
began to take a share in the government, in the time of
Philippele-Bel; ever since which period they have been on
the increase. In the year 1775, M. de Malesherbes, speaking
in the name of the Cour des Aides, said to Louis XIV: –*
*See “Memoires pour servir a l’Histoire du Droit Public de
la France en matiere d’impots,” p. 654, printed at Brussels in
1779.

“… Every corporation and every community of citizens
retained the right of administering its own affairs; a right
which not only forms part of the primitive constitution of
the kingdom, but has a still higher origin; for it is the right
of nature, and of reason. Nevertheless, your subjects, Sire,
have been deprived of it; and we cannot refrain from saying
that in this respect your government has fallen into puerile
extremes. From the time when powerful ministers made it a
political principle to prevent the convocation of a national
assembly, one consequence has succeeded another, until the
deliberations of the inhabitants of a village are declared null
when they have not been authorized by the Intendant. Of
course, if the community has an expensive undertaking to
carry through, it must remain under the control of the sub-
delegate of the Intendant, and, consequently, follow the plan
he proposes, employ his favorite workmen, pay them accord-
ing to his pleasure; and if an action at law is deemed neces-
sary, the Intendant’s permission must be obtained. The cause
must be pleaded before this first tribunal, previous to its be-
ing carried into a public court; and if the opinion of the
Intendant is opposed to that of the inhabitants, or if their
adversary enjoys his favor, the community is deprived of the

power of defending its rights. Such are the means, Sire, which
have been exerted to extinguish the municipal spirit in France;
and to stifle, if possible, the opinions of the citizens. The
nation may be said to lie under an interdict, and to be in
wardship under guardians.” What could be said more to the
purpose at the present day, when the Revolution has achieved
what are called its victories in centralization?
In 1789, Jefferson wrote from Paris to one of his friends: -
”There is no country where the mania for over-governing
has taken deeper root than in France, or been the source of
greater mischief.” (Letter to Madison, August 28, 1789.) The
fact is, that for several centuries past the central power of
France has done everything it could to extend central ad-
ministration; it has acknowledged no other limits than its
own strength. The central power to which the Revolution
gave birth made more rapid advances than any of its prede-
cessors, because it was stronger and wiser than they had been;
Louis XIV committed the welfare of such communities to
the caprice of an intendant; Napoleon left them to that of
the Minister. The same principle governed both, though its
consequences were more or less remote.

Appendix L

The immutability of the constitution of France is a neces-
sary consequence of the laws of that country. To begin with
the most important of all the laws, that which decides the
order of succession to the throne; what can be more immu-
table in its principle than a political order founded upon the
natural succession of father to son? In 1814, Louis XVIII
had established the perpetual law of hereditary succession in
favor of his own family. The individuals who regulated the
consequences of the Revolution of 1830 followed his example;
they merely established the perpetuity of the law in favor of
another family. In this respect they imitated the Chancellor
Meaupou, who, when he erected the new Parliament upon
the ruins of the old, took care to declare in the same ordi-
nance that the rights of the new magistrates should be as
inalienable as those of their predecessors had been. The laws
of 1830, like those of 1814, point out no way of changing
the constitution: and it is evident that the ordinary means of
legislation are insufficient for this purpose. As the King, the
Peers, and the Deputies, all derive their authority from the

constitution, these three powers united cannot alter a law by
virtue of which alone they govern. Out of the pale of the
constitution they are nothing: where, when, could they take
their stand to effect a change in its provisions? The alterna-
tive is clear: either their efforts are powerless against the char-
ter, which continues to exist in spite of them, in which case
they only reign in the name of the charter; or they succeed
in changing the charter, and then, the law by which they
existed being annulled, they themselves cease to exist. By
destroying the charter, they destroy themselves. This is much
more evident in the laws of 1830 than in those of 1814. In
1814, the royal prerogative took its stand above and beyond
the constitution; but in 1830, it was avowedly created by,
and dependent on, the constitution. A part, therefore, of the
French constitution is immutable, because it is united to the
destiny of a family; and the body of the constitution is equally
immutable, because there appear to be no legal means of
changing it. These remarks are not applicable to England.
That country having no written constitution, who can assert
when its constitution is changed?

Appendix M

The most esteemed authors who have written upon the En-
glish Constitution agree with each other in establishing the
omnipotence of the Parliament. Delolme says: “It is a fun-
damental principle with the English lawyers, that Parliament
can do everything except making a woman a man, or a man
a woman.” Blackstone expresses himself more in detail, if
not more energetically, than Delolme, in the following terms:
– “The power and jurisdiction of Parliament, says Sir Ed-
ward Coke (4 Inst. 36), is so transcendent and absolute that
it cannot be confined, either for causes or persons, within
any bounds.” And of this High Court, he adds, may be truly
said, “Si antiquitatem spectes, est vetustissima; si dignitatem,
est honoratissima; si jurisdictionem, est capacissima.” It hath
sovereign and uncontrollable authority in the making, con-
firming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviv-
ing, and expounding of laws, concerning matters of all pos-
sible denominations; ecclesiastical or temporal; civil, mili-
tary, maritime, or criminal; this being the place where that
absolute despotic power which must, in all governments,

reside somewhere, is intrusted by the constitution of these
kingdoms. All mischiefs and grievances, operations and rem-
edies, that transcend the ordinary course of the laws, are
within the reach of this extraordinary tribunal. It can regu-
late or new-model the succession to the Crown; as was done
in the reign of Henry VIII and William III. It can alter the
established religion of the land; as was done in a variety of
instances in the reigns of King Henry VIII and his three
children. It can change and create afresh even the constitu-
tion of the kingdom, and of parliaments themselves; as was
done by the Act of Union and the several statutes for trien-
nial and septennial elections. It can, in short, do everything
that is not naturally impossible to be done; and, therefore
some have not scrupled to call its power, by a figure rather
too bold, the omnipotence of Parliament.”

Appendix N

There is no question upon which the American constitu-
tions agree more fully than upon that of political jurisdic-
tion. All the constitutions which take cognizance of this

Louisiana (Art. 5); Mississippi (Art. 5); Alabama (Art. 6);
Pennsylvania (Art. 4), crimes committed in the non-perfor-
mance of official duties. In the States of Illinois, Georgia,
Maine, and Connecticut, no particular offences are speci-
fied.

Appendix O

It is true that the powers of Europe may carry on maritime
wars with the Union; but there is always greater facility and
less danger in supporting a maritime than a continental war.
Maritime warfare only requires one species of effort. A com-
mercial people which consents to furnish its government with
the necessary funds, is sure to possess a fleet. And it is far
easier to induce a nation to part with its money, almost un-
consciously, than to reconcile it to sacrifices of men and per-
sonal efforts. Moreover, defeat by sea rarely compromises the
existence or independence of the people which endures it.
As for continental wars, it is evident that the nations of Eu-
rope cannot be formidable in this way to the American Union.
It would be very difficult to transport and maintain in

America more than 25,000 soldiers; an army which may be
considered to represent a nation of about 2,000,000 of men.
The most populous nation of Europe contending in this way
against the Union, is in the position of a nation of 2,000,000
of inhabitants at war with one of 12,000,000. Add to this,
that America has all its resources within reach, whilst the
European is at 4,000 miles distance from his; and that the
immensity of the American continent would of itself present
an insurmountable obstacle to its conquest.

Appendix P

The first American journal appeared in April, 1704, and was
published at Boston. See “Collection of the Historical Soci-
ety of Massachusetts,” vol. vi. p. 66. It would be a mistake to
suppose that the periodical press has always been entirely
free in the American colonies: an attempt was made to es-
tablish something analogous to a censorship and prelimi-
nary security. Consult the Legislative Documents of Massa-
chusetts of January 14, 1722. The Committee appointed by
the General Assembly (the legislative body of the province)

Appendix Q

The Federal Constitution has introduced the jury into the
tribunals of the Union in the same way as the States had
introduced it into their own several courts; but as it has not
established any fixed rules for the choice of jurors, the fed-
eral courts select them from the ordinary jury list which each
State makes for itself. The laws of the States must therefore
be examined for the theory of the formation of juries. See
Story’s “Commentaries on the Constitution,” B. iii. chap.
38, p. 654-659; Sergeant’s “Constitutional Law,” p. 165. See
also the Federal Laws of the years 1789, 1800, and 1802,
upon the subject. For the purpose of thoroughly understand-
ing the American principles with respect to the formation of
juries, I examined the laws of States at a distance from one
another, and the following observations were the result of
my inquiries. In America, all the citizens who exercise the
elective franchise have the right of serving upon a jury. The
great State of New York, however, has made a slight differ-
ence between the two privileges, but in a spirit quite con-
trary to that of the laws of France; for in the State of New

jury are indemnified for their attendance either by the State
or the parties concerned. They receive in general a dollar per
day, besides their travelling expenses. In America, the being
placed upon the jury is looked upon as a burden, but it is a
burden which is very supportable. See Brevard’s “Digest of
the Public Statute Law of South Carolina,” vol. i. pp. 446
and 454, vol. ii. pp. 218 and 338; “The General Laws of
Massachusetts, revised and published by authority of the
Legislature,” vol. ii. pp. 187 and 331; “The Revised Statutes
of the State of New York,” vol. ii. pp. 411, 643, 717, 720;
“The Statute Law of the State of Tennessee,” vol. i. p. 209;
“Acts of the State of Ohio,” pp. 95 and 210; and “Digeste
general des Actes de la Legislature de la Louisiane.”

Appendix R

If we attentively examine the constitution of the jury as in-
troduced into civil proceedings in England, we shall readily
perceive that the jurors are under the immediate control of
the judge. It is true that the verdict of the jury, in civil as well
as in criminal cases, comprises the question of fact and the

question of right in the same reply; thus - a house is claimed
by Peter as having been purchased by him: this is the fact to
be decided. The defendant puts in a plea of incompetency
on the part of the vendor: this is the legal question to be
resolved. But the jury do not enjoy the same character of
infallibility in civil cases, according to the practice of the
English courts, as they do in criminal cases. The judge may
refuse to receive the verdict; and even after the first trial has
taken place, a second or new trial may be awarded by the
Court. See Blackstone’s “Commentaries,” book iii. ch. 24.

Appendix S

I find in my travelling journal a passage which may serve to
convey a more complete notion of the trials to which the
women of America, who consent to follow their husbands
into the wilds, are often subjected. This description has noth-
ing to recommend it to the reader but its strict accuracy:
“… From time to time we come to fresh clearings; all these
places are alike; I shall describe the one at which we have halted
to-night, for it will serve to remind me of all the others.

pioneer himself made his appearance at the door of his dwell-
ing; he looked at us with a rapid and inquisitive glance, made
a sign to the dogs to go into the house, and set them the
example, without betraying either curiosity or apprehension
at our arrival.
“We entered the log house: the inside is quite unlike that
of the cottages of the peasantry of Europe: it contains more
than is superfluous, less than is necessary. A single window
with a muslin blind; on a hearth of trodden clay an immense
fire, which lights the whole structure; above the hearth a
good rifle, a deer’s skin, and plumes of eagles’ feathers; on
the right hand of the chimney a map of the United States,
raised and shaken by the wind through the crannies in the
wall; near the map, upon a shelf formed of a roughly hewn
plank, a few volumes of books - a Bible, the six first books of
Milton, and two of Shakespeare’s plays; along the wall, trunks
instead of closets; in the centre of the room a rude table,
with legs of green wood, and with the bark still upon them,
looking as if they grew out of the ground on which they
stood; but on this table a tea-pot of British ware, silver spoons,
cracked tea-cups, and some newspapers.

“The master of this dwelling has the strong angular fea-
tures and lank limbs peculiar to the native of New England.
It is evident that this man was not born in the solitude in
which we have met with him: his physical constitution suf-
fices to show that his earlier years were spent in the midst of
civilized society, and that he belongs to that restless, calcu-
lating, and adventurous race of men, who do with the ut-
most coolness things only to be accounted for by the ardor
of the passions, and who endure the life of savages for a time,
in order to conquer and civilize the backwoods.
“When the pioneer perceived that we were crossing his
threshold, he came to meet us and shake hands, as is their
custom; but his face was quite unmoved; he opened the con-
versation by inquiring what was going on in the world; and
when his curiosity was satisfied, he held his peace, as if he
were tired by the noise and importunity of mankind. When
we questioned him in our turn, he gave us all the informa-
tion we required; he then attended sedulously, but without
eagerness, to our personal wants. Whilst he was engaged in
providing thus kindly for us, how came it that in spit of
ourselves we felt our gratitude die upon our lips? It is that

sists, the whole family is gathered for the night. The dwell-
ing is itself a little world – an ark of civilization amidst an
ocean of foliage: a hundred steps beyond it the primeval for-
est spreads its shades, and solitude resumes its sway.”

Appendix T

It is not the equality of conditions which makes men im-
moral and irreligious; but when men, being equal, are at the
same time immoral and irreligious, the effects of immorality
and irreligion easily manifest themselves outwardly, because
men have but little influence upon each other, and no class
exists which can undertake to keep society in order. Equality
of conditions never engenders profligacy of morals, but it
sometimes allows that profligacy to show itself.

Appendix U

Setting aside all those who do not think at all, and those
who dare not say what they think, the immense majority of
the Americans will still be found to appear satisfied with the

suppose that there was anything degraded in the character of
the French of that age. There might be some sort of servi-
tude in France at that time, but assuredly there was no ser-
vile spirit among the people. The writers of that age felt a
species of genuine enthusiasm in extolling the power of their
king; and there was no peasant so obscure in his hovel as not
to take a pride in the glory of his sovereign, and to die cheer-
fully with the cry “Vive le Roi!” upon his lips. These very
same forms of loyalty are now odious to the French people.
Which are wrong? - the French of the age of Louis XIV, or
their descendants of the present day?
Our judgment of the laws of a people must not then be
founded Future Condition Of Three Races In The United
States exclusively upon its inclinations, since those inclina-
tions change from age to age; but upon more elevated prin-
ciples and a more general experience. The love which a people
may show for its law proves only this: - that we should not
be in too great a hurry to change them.

Appendix V

In the chapter to which this note relates I have pointed out
one source of danger: I am now about to point out another
kind of peril, more rare indeed, but far more formidable if it
were ever to make its appearance. If the love of physical grati-
fication and the taste for well-being, which are naturally sug-
gested to men by a state of equality, were to get entire pos-
session of the mind of a democratic people, and to fill it
completely, the manners of the nation would become so to-
tally opposed to military tastes, that perhaps even the army
would eventually acquire a love of peace, in spite of the pe-
culiar interest which leads it to desire war. Living in the midst
of a state of general relaxation, the troops would ultimately
think it better to rise without efforts, by the slow but com-
modious advancement of a peace establishment, than to
purchase more rapid promotion at the cost of all the toils
and privations of the field. With these feelings, they would
take up arms without enthusiasm, and use them without
energy; they would allow themselves to be led to meet the
foe, instead of marching to attack him. It must not be sup-

posed that this pacific state of the army would render it ad-
verse to revolutions; for revolutions, and especially military
revolutions, which are generally very rapid, are attended in-
deed with great dangers, but not with protracted toil; they
gratify ambition at less cost than war; life only is at stake,
and the men of democracies care less for their lives than for
their comforts. Nothing is more dangerous for the freedom
and the tranquillity of a people than an army afraid of war,
because, as such an army no longer seeks to maintain its
importance and its influence on the field of battle, it seeks to
assert them elsewhere. Thus it might happen that the men
of whom a democratic army consists should lose the inter-
ests of citizens without acquiring the virtues of soldiers; and
that the army should cease to be fit for war without ceasing
to be turbulent. I shall here repeat what I have said in the
text: the remedy for these dangers is not to be found in the
army, but in the country: a democratic people which has
preserved the manliness of its character will never be at a loss
for military prowess in its soldiers.

Appendix W

Men connect the greatness of their idea of unity with means,
God with ends: hence this idea of greatness, as men conceive
it, leads us into infinite littleness. To compel all men to fol-
low the same course towards the same object is a human
notion; - to introduce infinite variety of action, but so com-
bined that all these acts lead by a multitude of different
courses to the accomplishment of one great design, is a con-
ception of the Deity. The human idea of unity is almost al-
ways barren; the divine idea pregnant with abundant results.
Men think they manifest their greatness by simplifying the
means they use; but it is the purpose of God which is simple
– his means are infinitely varied.

Appendix X

A democratic people is not only led by its own tastes to cen-
tralize its government, but the passions of all the men by
whom it is governed constantly urge it in the same direction.
It may easily be foreseen that almost all the able and ambi-

tious members of a democratic community will labor with-
out 2 ceasing to extend the powers of government, because
they all hope at some time or other to wield those powers. It
is a waste of time to attempt to prove to them that extreme
centralization may be injurious to the State, since they are
centralizing for their own benefit. Amongst the public men
of democracies there are hardly any but men of great disin-
terestedness or extreme mediocrity who seek to oppose the
centralization of government: the former are scarce, the lat-
ter powerless.

Appendix Y

I have often asked myself what would happen if, amidst the
relaxation of democratic manners, and as a consequence of
the restless spirit of the army, a military government were
ever to be founded amongst any of the nations of the present
age. I think that even such a government would not differ
very much from the outline I have drawn in the chapter to
which this note belongs, and that it would retain none of the
fierce characteristics of a military oligarchy. I am persuaded

that, in such a case, a sort of fusion would take place be-
tween the habits of official men and those of the military
service. The administration would assume something of a
military character, and the army some of the usages of the
civil administration. The result would be a regular, clear, ex-
act, and absolute system of government; the people would
become the reflection of the army, and the community be
drilled like a garrison.

Appendix Z

It cannot be absolutely or generally affirmed that the great-
est danger of the present age is license or tyranny, anarchy or
despotism. Both are equally to be feared; and the one may as
easily proceed as the other from the selfsame cause, namely,
that “general apathy,” which is the consequence of what I
have termed “individualism”: it is because this apathy exists,
that the executive government, having mustered a few troops,
is able to commit acts of oppression one day, and the next
day a party, which has mustered some thirty men in its ranks,
can also commit acts of oppression. Neither one nor the other

can found anything to last; and the causes which enable them
to succeed easily, prevent them from succeeding long: they
rise because nothing opposes them, and they sink because
nothing supports them. The proper object therefore of our
most strenuous resistance, is far less either anarchy or despo-
tism than the apathy which may almost indifferently beget
either the one or the other.

Constitution of the United States of America

We The People of the United States, in Order to form a
more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tran-
quillity, provide for the common defence, promote the gen-
eral welfare, and secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves
and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution
for the United States of America:

Article I

Section 1. All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested
in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a
Senate and House of Representatives.

Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United
States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in

eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Con-
necticut five, New York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania

and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeach-
ment. Section 3. The Senate of the United States shall be
composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the
Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have

of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may
be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first
Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of
the second Class at the expiration of the fourth Year, and of
the third Class at the expiration of the sixth Year, so that
one-third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies
happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of
the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make
temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Leg-
islature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.

No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained
to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of
the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an
Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.

of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally
divided. The Senate shall choose their other Officers, and

ments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath
or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is

Members present. Judgment in cases of Impeachment shall
not extend further than to removal from Office, and dis-
qualification to hold and enjoy any Office of Honor, Trust,
or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted
shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial,
Judgment, and Punishment according to Law.

Section 4. The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elec-
tions for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in
each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may
at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as
to the Places of choosing Senators.

and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in Decem-
ber, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.

Section 5. Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections,
Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Ma-
jority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but
a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be
authorized to compel the Attendance of Absent Members,
in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House
may provide.
Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,
punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with a
Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member.
Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and
from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as

may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and
Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall,
at the Desire of one-fifth of those present, be entered on the
Journal.

out the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three

sion of their respective Houses, and in going to and return-
ing from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either
House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.
No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for
which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under
the Authority of the United States, which shall have been
created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased

during such time; and no Person holding any Office under
the United States, shall be a Member of either House during
his Continuance in Office.

Section 7. All Bills for Raising Revenue shall originate in the
House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or
concur with Amendments as on other Bills.
Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Represen-
tatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be pre-
sented to the President of the United States; if he approve he
shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections,
to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall
enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed
to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two-thirds of
that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, to-
gether with the Objections, to the other House, by which it
shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds
of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases
the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and
Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against
the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House re-

spectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President
within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been
presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like manner as
if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjourn-
ment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.
Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concur-
rence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be
necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be
presented to the President of the United States; and before
the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or be-
ing disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of
the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the
Rules and Limitations prescribed in the case of a Bill.
