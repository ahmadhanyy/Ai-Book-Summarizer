Michael Witmore

Director, Folger Shakespeare Library

It is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their
composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems
have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to
make them their own.

Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process
of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings
in language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,
new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a
mile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds.
These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource
for study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic
texts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The
Folger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a
trusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.

The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis
for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their
origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the
single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An
unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and
artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been
consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions
also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of
Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.

I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul
Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s
works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a
richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers
who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow
the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the
Folger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and
digital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I
commend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.

From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare

Library

Until now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly
Folger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of
Shakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the
Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of
the plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that
there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But
Shakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or
plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some
cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published
versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great
collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First
Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of
Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others.
Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then
amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other
versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate
text.

Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an
unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the
period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that
made it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred
years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on
cultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,
for example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda
to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The
Tempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not
take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare
editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her
father, Prospero.

The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long
before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to
make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The
Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger
Shakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly
transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,
which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger
Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial
interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from
Othello: “ If she in chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square
brackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood  and sword and
fire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from

Textual Introduction

By Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine

Hamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier.  Who hath relieved/you?”). At
any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for
more information.

Because the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with
twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger
here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,
and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the
plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study
and enjoyment of Shakespeare.

In Love’s Labor’s Lost, the comedy centers on four young men who
fall in love against their wills. The men, one of them the king of
Navarre, pledge to study for three years, avoiding all contact with
women. When the Princess of France arrives on a state visit, the king
insists she and her ladies camp outside the court. Even so, each
young man falls in love with one of the ladies.

Meanwhile, Don Armado, a Spanish soldier, falls for a servant girl,
Jacquenetta. Costard, an illiterate local, mixes up two letters he is to
deliver, one from Armado to Jacquenetta and the other from
Berowne, one of the king’s companions, to Rosaline, one of the
French ladies.

The men confess they are in love, and devise a pageant for the
ladies, who set a trap for them by exchanging identifying markers.
When word comes that the princess’s father is dead, the ladies reject
the men’s proposals as rash and impose a year’s delay before any
further wooing.

 Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.
  Light seeking light doth light of light beguile.
 So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
 Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
 Study me how to please the eye indeed
  By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
 Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
  And give him light that it was blinded by.
 Study is like the heaven’s glorious sun,
  That will not be deep-searched with saucy looks.
 Small have continual plodders ever won,
  Save base authority from others’ books.
 These earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights,
  That give a name to every fixèd star,
 Have no more profit of their shining nights
  Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
 Too much to know is to know naught but fame,
 And every godfather can give a name.

  
 Fit in his place and time.

 Jaquenetta. The manner of it is, I was taken with
 the manner.

  In what manner?
  In manner and form following, sir, all those

 three. I was seen with her in the manor house,
 sitting with her upon the form, and taken following
 her into the park, which, put together, is “in manner
 and form following.” Now, sir, for the manner.
 It is the manner of a man to speak to a woman. For
 the form—in some form.

  For the “following,” sir?
  As it shall follow in my correction, and God

 defend the right.

  No, no. O Lord, sir, no!

  How canst thou part sadness and melancholy,

  I will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it

 is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
 base wench. If drawing my sword against the
 humor of affection would deliver me from the
 reprobate thought of it, I would take desire prisoner
 and ransom him to any French courtier for a
 new-devised curtsy. I think scorn to sigh; methinks
 I should outswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy. What
 great men have been in love?
  Hercules, master.

  Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear

 boy, name more; and, sweet my child, let them be
 men of good repute and carriage.
  Samson, master; he was a man of good carriage,
 great carriage, for he carried the town gates on his
 back like a porter, and he was in love.

  O, well-knit Samson, strong-jointed Samson;

 I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst
 me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was
 Samson’s love, my dear Mote?
  A woman, master.

  Of what complexion?

  Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of
 the four.

  Tell me precisely of what complexion.

  Of the sea-water green, sir.

  Is that one of the four complexions?

  As I have read, sir, and the best of them too.

  Green indeed is the color of lovers. But to

 have a love of that color, methinks Samson had
 small reason for it. He surely affected her for her
 wit.

  Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked
 under such colors.

  My father’s wit and my mother’s tongue, assist
 me.

  Sweet invocation of a child, most pretty and

 pathetical.
 

 If she be made of white and red,
  Her faults will ne’er be known,
 For blushing  cheeks by faults are bred,
  And fears by pale white shown.
 Then if she fear, or be to blame,
  By this you shall not know,
 For still her cheeks possess the same
  Which native she doth owe.

 A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
 white and red.

  Is there not a ballad, boy, of “The King and

 the Beggar”?
  The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
 three ages since, but I think now ’tis not to be found;
 or if it were, it would neither serve for the writing
 nor the tune.

  I will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I

 may example my digression by some mighty precedent.
 Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in
 the park with the rational hind Costard. She deserves
 well.

  No, sir, that were fast and loose. Thou shalt to
 prison.

  Well, if ever I do see the merry days of

 desolation that I have seen, some shall see.
  What shall some see?

  Nay, nothing, Master Mote, but what they

 look upon. It is not for prisoners to be too silent in
 their words, and therefore I will say nothing. I thank
 God I have as little patience as another man, and
 therefore I can be quiet.

  I do affect the very ground (which is base)

 where her shoe (which is baser) guided by her foot
 (which is basest) doth tread. I shall be forsworn
 (which is a great argument of falsehood) if I love.
 And how can that be true love which is falsely
 attempted? Love is a familiar; love is a devil. There is
 no evil angel but love, yet was Samson so tempted,
 and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon
 so seduced, and he had a very good wit. Cupid’s
 butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules’ club, and therefore
 too much odds for a Spaniard’s rapier. The first
 and second cause will not serve my turn; the
 passado he respects not, the duello he regards not.
 His disgrace is to be called “boy,” but his glory is to
 subdue men. Adieu, valor; rust, rapier; be still,
 drum, for your manager is in love. Yea, he loveth.
 Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme, for I am
 sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise wit, write pen, for I
 am for whole volumes in folio.

 Madam, your father here doth intimate
 The payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
 Being but the one half of an entire sum
 Disbursèd by my father in his wars.
 But say that he or we, as neither have,
 Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
 A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which
 One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
 Although not valued to the money’s worth.
 If then the King your father will restore
 But that one half which is unsatisfied,
 We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
 And hold fair friendship with his Majesty.
 But that, it seems, he little purposeth;
 For here he doth demand to have repaid
 A hundred thousand crowns, and not demands,
 On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
 To have his title live in Aquitaine—
 Which we much rather had depart withal,
 And have the money by our father lent,
 Than Aquitaine, so gelded as it is.
 Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
 From reason’s yielding, your fair self should make
 A yielding ’gainst some reason in my breast,
 And go well satisfied to France again.

  How hast thou purchased this experience?

  By my penny  of observation.

  But O— but O—.

  “The hobby-horse is forgot.”

  Call’st thou my love “hobby-horse”?

  No, master. The hobby-horse is but a colt,  aside
 and your love perhaps a hackney.—But have you
 forgot your love?

  Almost I had.

  Negligent student, learn her by heart.

  By heart and in heart, boy.

  And out of heart, master. All those three I will
 prove.

  What wilt thou prove?

  A man, if I live; and this “by, in, and without,”
 upon the instant: “by” heart you love her, because
 your heart cannot come by her; “in” heart you love
 her, because your heart is in love with her; and
 “out” of heart you love her, being out of heart that
 you cannot enjoy her.

  I am all these three.

  And three times as much more,  aside  and yet
 nothing at all.

  Fetch hither the swain. He must carry me a

 letter.

 As thy eyebeams, when their fresh rays have smote

  Through the transparent bosom of the deep
 As doth thy face, through tears of mine, give light.
  Thou shin’st in every tear that I do weep.
 No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
  So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
 Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
  And they thy glory through my grief will show.
 But do not love thyself; then thou wilt  keep
 My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.

 And Nestor play at pushpin with the boys,

 For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
 In leaden contemplation have found out
 Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
 Of beauty’s tutors have enriched you with?
 Other slow arts entirely keep the brain
 And therefore, finding barren practicers,
 Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil.
 But love, first learnèd in a lady’s eyes,
 Lives not alone immurèd in the brain,
 But with the motion of all elements
 Courses as swift as thought in every power,
 And gives to every power a double power,
 Above their functions and their offices.
 It adds a precious seeing to the eye.
 A lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
 A lover’s ear will hear the lowest sound,
 When the suspicious head of theft is stopped.
 Love’s feeling is more soft and sensible
 Than are the tender horns of cockled snails.
 Love’s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.
 For valor, is not love a Hercules,
 Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
 Subtle as Sphinx, as sweet and musical
 As bright Apollo’s lute strung with his hair.
 And when love speaks, the voice of all the gods
 Make heaven drowsy with the harmony.
 Never durst poet touch a pen to write
 Until his ink were tempered with love’s sighs.
 O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
 And plant in tyrants mild humility.
 From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive.
 They sparkle still the right Promethean fire.
 They are the books, the arts, the academes
 That show, contain, and nourish all the world.
 Else none at all in ought proves excellent.

 Or women’s sake, by whom we men are men,

  I praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at

 dinner have been sharp and sententious, pleasant
 without scurrility, witty without affection, audacious
 without impudency, learned without opinion,
 and strange without heresy. I did converse this
 quondam day with a companion of the King’s, who
 is intituled, nominated, or called Don Adriano de
 Armado.

  Novi hominem  tanquam te. His humor

 is lofty, his discourse peremptory, his tongue filed,
 his eye ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
 behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
 too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
 were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.

  A most singular and choice epithet.

  He draweth out the thread of his verbosity

 finer than the staple of his argument. I abhor
 such fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
 point-devise companions, such rackers of orthography,
 as to speak “dout,” fine, when he should
 say “doubt”; “det” when he should pronounce

  Sir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my

 familiar, I do assure you, very good friend. For
 what is inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech
 thee, remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee apparel
 thy head. And among other important and most
 serious designs, and of great import indeed, too—
 but let that pass; for I must tell thee, it will please his
 Grace, by the world, sometimes to lean upon my
 poor shoulder and with his royal finger thus dally
 with my excrement, with my mustachio—but,
 sweetheart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
 fable! Some certain special honors it pleaseth his
 Greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
 travel, that hath seen the world—but let that pass.
 The very all of all is—but sweetheart, I do implore
 secrecy—that the King would have me present the
 Princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation,
 or show, or pageant, or antic, or firework.
 Now, understanding that the curate and your sweet
 self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking
 out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you
 withal to the end to crave your assistance.

  Sir, you shall present before her the Nine

 Worthies.—Sir Nathaniel,  as concerning some
 entertainment of time, some show in the posterior
 of this day, to be rendered  by our assistance,  the
 King’s command, and this most gallant, illustrate,
 and learned gentleman, before the Princess—I say,
 none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies.

  Where will you find men worthy enough to

 present them?

 gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus. This swain, because
 of his great limb or joint, shall pass Pompey
 the Great; the page, Hercules—

  Shall I have audience? He shall present

 Hercules in minority. His enter and exit shall be
 strangling a snake; and I will have an apology for
 that purpose.
  An excellent device. So, if any of the audience
 hiss, you may cry “Well done, Hercules, now thou
 crushest the snake.” That is the way to make an
 offense gracious, though few have the grace to do it.

  For the rest of the Worthies?

 “Thus must thou speak,” and “thus thy body bear.”
 And ever and anon they made a doubt
 Presence majestical would put him out;
 “For,” quoth the King, “an angel shalt thou see;
 Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.”
 The boy replied “An angel is not evil.
 I should have feared her had she been a devil.”
 With that, all laughed and clapped him on the

 shoulder,

 Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.
 One rubbed his elbow thus, and fleered, and swore
 A better speech was never spoke before.
 Another with his finger and his thumb,
 Cried “Via! We will do ’t, come what will come.”
 The third he capered and cried “All goes well!”
 The fourth turned on the toe, and down he fell.

 With such a zealous laughter so profound
 That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
 To check their folly, passion’s solemn tears.

 That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
 In honorable terms. Nay, he can sing
 A mean most meanly; and in ushering
 Mend him who can. The ladies call him sweet.
 The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet.
 This is the flower that smiles on everyone
 To show his teeth as white as whale’s bone;
 And consciences that will not die in debt
 Pay him the due of “honey-tongued Boyet.”
