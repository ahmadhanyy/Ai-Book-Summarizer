FOUND

I N TRO DU CTI ON .

Now that thisb ook is printed, and about to be given to

the world, the sense
of its shortcomings, both in style and

contents, weighs very heavily upon me .
AS regards the

latter, I can only say that it does not pretend to be a full
account
of everything we did and saw.
There are many

things connected with o ur journey into K uku analand which
I should have liked
to dwell upon at length , and which

have , asit is, been scarcely alluded to .
Among these are

the curious legends which I collected about the chain ar

m
or that saved us from destruction in the great battle of

Loo, and also about the

“ silent ones

”
or colossi at the

mouth
of the stalactite cave .
Again, if I had given way

to my own impulses I Should have liked to go into the dif

fer ences, some
of which are to my mind very suggestive,

between the Zulu and K u ku ana dialects .
Also a few pages

might proﬁtably hav e been given u p to the consideration

of the indigenous ﬂora and fauna of
Then

there remains the most interesting subject— that, as it is,

antelope with which I waspreviou sly

has only been incidentally alluded to— of the m agniﬁcent
system
of military organization in force in that co untry,

which is, in my opinion, much superior to that inaugurated
by Chaka in Zululand, inasmuch as it permits
of even

more rapid mobilization, and does not necessitate the em
ployment of the pernicious system
of forced celibacy . And,

lastly, I have scarcely touched on the domestic and family
customs of the Kuku anas, many of which are exceedingly
quaint, or
on their proﬁciency in the art of smeltin g and

welding metals.
This last they carry to considerable per

fection, of which a good example is to be seen in their

“ tollas,

”
or heavy throwing
- knives, the backs
of these

knives being made
of hammered iron, and the edges
of

beautiful steel welded with great skill on to the iron backs .
The fact
of the matter is that I thought (and so did Sir

Henry Curtis and Captain Good) that the best plan would
be to tell the story in a plain, straightforward manner, and
leave these matters to be dealt with subsequently i n what
ever way may ultimately appear to be desirable .
In the

meanwhile I shall , of course, be delighted to give any i n
formation
i n my power to anybody interested in such

things.

And now i t only remains for me to offer my apologies

for my blunt way of writing.
I can only say in excuse for

it that I am more accustomed to handle a riﬂe than a pen,
and cannot make any pretence to the grand literary ﬂights
and ﬂourishes which I see in novels— for I sometimes like
to read a novel .
I suppose they—the ﬂights and ﬂourishes

are desirable , and I regret not being able to supply them

but at the same time I cannot help thinking that simple
things are always the most impressive, and books are easier
to understand when they are written in plain language,
though I have perhaps no right to set up an opinion
on

such a matter.

“ A Sharp spear,

” runs the K u ku ana say

ing,
needs no polish
and on the same principle I vent

u r e to hope that a true story, however strange it may be,

does not require to be decked out in ﬁne words .

I ME E T
SI R
H E N RY
CU RTIS .

IT is a curious thing that at my age— ﬁfty

-ﬁve last birth

day— I should ﬁnd myself taking up a pen to try and write
a history .
I wonder what sort of a history it will be when

I have done it, if I ever come to the end
of the trip
I

have done a good many things in my life, which seems a
long
on e to me, owing to my having begun so young, per

haps .
At an age when other boys are at school I was earn

ing my living as a trader in the old Colony .
I have been

trading, hunting, ﬁghting, or
m ining ever Since .
And yet

it is only eight months ago that I made my pile .
It is a

big pile now I have got it— I don

’t yet know how big— but

I don

’t think I would go through the last ﬁfteen
or si x

teen months again for it
no , not if I knew that I should

come out safe at the end , pile and all .
But then, I am a

timid
m an, and don

’t like violence , and am pretty sick of

adventure .
I wonder why I am going to write this book ;

it is not in my line .
I am not a literary man , though very

devoted to the Old Testament and also to the
Ingoldsby

Legends .

”
Let me try and set down my reasons, just to

see if I have any .

First reason : Because Sir Henry Curtis and Captain

John Good asked me to .

2
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

Second reason : Because I am laid up here at Durban

with the pain and trouble in my left leg .
Ever since that

confounded lion got hold
of me I have been liable to it,

and its being rather bad just now makes me limp more
than ever .
There must be some poison in a lion

’s teeth,

otherwise how is it that when your wounds are healed they
break ou t again, generally, mark you, at the same time of
year that you got your mauling ?
It is a hard thing that

when one has shot sixty

-ﬁ ve lions, as I have in the course

of my life, that the sixty

-sixth should chew your leg like a

quid of tobacco .
It breaks the routine of the thing, and,

putting other considerations aside, I am an orderly man
and don

’t like that .
This Isby the way .

Third reason : Because I want my boy Harry, who is

over there at the hospital in London studying to become a
doctor, to have something to amuse him and keep him out

of mischief for a week
or so .
Hospital work must some

times pall and get rather dull, for even
of cutting -u p dead

bodies there must come satiety, and as this history won

’t

be dull, whatever else it may be, it may put a little life into
things for a day or two while he is reading it .

Fourth reason and last
Because I am going to tell the

strangest story that I know of.
It may seem a queer thing

to say that, especially considering that there is no woman
in it— except Foulata .
Stop , though
there is Gagaoola,

if she was a woman and not a ﬁend .
But she was a hun

dred at least, and therefore
not marriageable, so I don

’t

count her.
At any rate, I can safely say that there is not

a p etti coat in the whole history .
Well, I had better come

to the yoke .
It

’s a stiff place, and I feel as though I were

bogged up to the axle .
But

say (I

’m sure I don

’t know how they spell it) , softly does

it.
A strong team will come through at last, that is if

they ain

’t too poor .
Y ou will never do anything with poor

oxen .
N ow, to begin .

I, Allan Quatermain , of Durban , Natal , Gentleman, make

oath and
say— That

’s how I began my deposition before

the magistrate about poor
Khi va

’s and VentvOgel

’s sad

deaths ; but somehow it doesn

’t seem quite the right way

to begin a book .
And, besides, am I a gentleman
What

is a gentleman ?
I don

’t quite know, and yet I have had

to do with
niggers—no, I

’ll scratch that word
Diggers

ou t, for I don

’t like it .
I

’ve known natives who ar e, and

so you

’ll say, Harry, my boy, before you

’re done with this

tale, and I have known mean whites with lots
of money

and fresh ou t from home, too , who ai n

’t.
Well , at any rate

I was born a gentleman , though I

’ve been nothing but a poor

travelling trader and hunter all my life .
Whether I have

remained so I know not
you must judge of that.
Heaven

knows I

’ve tried .
I

’ve killed many men in my time, but I

have never slain wantonly or stained my hand in innocent
blood, only in self

-defence .
The Almighty gave us
ou r

lives, and I suppose he meant us to defend them
at least

I have always acted on that, and I hope it won

’t be brought

up against me when my
clock strikes .
There, there
it is

a cruel and a wicked world, and, for a timid man , I have
been mixed up in a deal of slaughter .
I can

’t tell the rights

of it, but at any rate I have never stolen, though I once
cheated a K afﬁr out of a herd of cattle .
But then, he had

done me a dirty turn, and it has trou bled me ever since
into the bargain .

Well, it

’s eighteen months or so ago since I ﬁrst met Sir

Henry Curtis and Captain Good, and it was in this way .
I had been up elephant hunting beyond Bamangwato, and

had had bad luck .
Everything went wrong that trip, and

to top
u p with I got the fever badly.
So soon as I was

well enough I trekked down to the Diamond Fields, sold
such ivory as I had , and also my wagon and oxen , dis
charged my hunters, and took the post

-cart to the Cape .

After spending a week in Cape Town, ﬁnding that they
overcharged me at the hotel, and having seen everything
there was to see, including the botanical gardens, which
seem to me likely to confer a great beneﬁt on the country,
and the new Houses of Parliament, which I expect will do
nothing
of the sort, I determined to go
on back to Natal

by the D u nkeld, then lying in the docks waiting for the

E di nbu rgh Castle due in from England .
I took my berth

and went aboard, and that afternoon the Natal passengers
from the E di nbu rgh Castle transhipped, and we weighed
anchor and put out to sea .

Among the passengers who came
on board there were

two who excited my c uriosity .
One, a man of about thirty,

was
one of the biggest

-chested and longest

-armed men I

ever saw.
He had yellow hair, a big yellow beard, clear

cut features , and large gray eyes set deep into his head.
I never saw a ﬁner

-looking man, and somehow he reminded

me of an ancient Dane .
Not that I kno w much of ancient

Danes, though I remember a modern Dane who did me ou t

of ten pounds ; but I remember once seeing a picture
of

some of those gentry, who , I take it, were a kind of white
Zulus .
They were drinking
ou t
of big horns, and their

long hair hung down their backs, and as I looked at my
friend standing there by the companion

-ladder, I thought

that if one only let his hair grow a bit, put
one
of those

chain shirts
on to those great Shoulders
of his, and gave

him a big battle

-axe and a horn mug, he might have sat as

’S MIN ES .

derstandtheir work, and to get to the prim e of life.
Well,

I suppose they don

’t mind it, but for
m y part I had rather

earn my bread as a hunter.
One

’s half

-pence are as scarce,

perhaps, but you don

’t get
so many kicks .
His name I

found out— b y referring to the passengers

’list— was Good

— Captain John Good .
He wasbroad , of medium height

,

dark, stout, and rather a curious man to look at .
He was

so very neat and so very clean shaved, and he always wore
an eye -glass in his right eye .
It seemed to grow there, for

it had no string, and he never took it
ou t except to wipe

it .
At ﬁrst I thought he used to Sleep in it, but I after

wards found that this was
a mistake .
He put it in his

trousers pocket when he went to bed, together with his
false teeth, of which he had two beautiful sets that have
often , my
own being none of the best, caused me to break

the tenth Commandment .
But I am anticipating .

Soon after we had got under way evening closed in ,

and brought with it very dirty weather .
A keen breeze

Sprang up off land, and a kind of aggravated Scotch mist
soon drove everybody from the deck .
And as for that

D u nkeld, she is a ﬂat

-bottomed punt, and, going up light

as she was, she rolled very heavily .
It almost seemed as

though she would go right over, but she never did .
It

was quite impossible to walk about, so I stood near the
engines, where it was warm, and amused myself with
watching the pendulum, which was ﬁxed Opposite to me,
swinging slowly backward and forward as the vessel rolled,

a nd marking the angle she touched at each lurch .

Th at pendulum

’s wrong ; it is not properly weighted,

suddenly said a voice at my shoulder, somewhat testily .
Looking round I saw the naval ofﬁcer I had noticed when

the passengers came aboard .

KI NG SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

‘7

Indeed ;
now what makes you think so
I asked .

Think so .
I don

’t think at all .
Why there
— as she

righted herself after a roll
if the ship had really rolled

to the degree that thing pointed to then she would never
have rolled again, that

’s all .
But it is just like these mer

chant skippers, they always are so confoundedly careless .

”

Just then the dinner

-bell rang, and I was not sorry, for

it is a dreadful thing to have to listen to an ofﬁcer of the
Royal Navy when he gets
on to that subject .
I only

know one worse thing, and that is
to hear a merchant

skipper express his candid opinion of ofﬁcers of the Royal
Navy .

Captain Good and I went down to dinner together, and

there we found Sir Henry Curtis already seated .
He and

Captain Good sat together, and I
sat opposite to them .

The captain and I soon got into talk about shooting and
what not, he asking me many questions, and I answering

aswell as I could .
Presently he got on to elephants .

“ Ah, sir,

” called
ou t somebody who was sitting near

me,
you

’ve got to the right man for that ; Hunter Qua

te r m ai n should be able to tell you about elephants if any

body can .

Sir Henry, who had been sitting quite quiet listening to

ou r talk, started visibly .

“ Excuse me, sir,

” he said, leaning forward across the

table, and speaking in a low, deep voice, a very suitable
voice , it seemed to me, to come
ou t
of those great lungs .

Excuse me, sir, but is your name Allan Quatermain? ”

I said it was .
The big
m an made no further remark , but

'I heard hi m

mutter
fortunate

” into his beard .

Presently dinner came to an end, and as we were leav

t

ing tho saloon Sir Henry came up
and asked
m e if I

would come into his cabin and smoke a pipe .
I accepted,

and he led the way to the D u nkeld deck cabin, and a very
good cabin it was .
It had been two cabins , but when Sir

Garnet , or one
of those big swells, went down the coast

in the D u nkeld they had knocked away the partition and
never put it up again .
There was a sofa i n the cabin, and

a little table in front
of it .
Sir Henry sent the steward

for a bottle of whiskey, and the three of us sat down and
lit ou r pipes .

“ Mr. Quatermain,
said Sir Henry Curtis, when the

steward had brought the whiskey and lit the lamp ,
the

year before last, about this time, you were, I believe , at

a place called Bamangwato, to the north
of the Trans

v aal .

”

“ I was,

” I answered, rather surprised that this gentle

man should be so well acquainted with my movements,
which were not, so far as I was aware, considered of gen
eral interest .

“ You were trading there, were you not
put in Cap

tain Good, in his quick way.

I was.
I took up a wagon

-load of goods and made a

camp outside the settlement, and stopped till I had sold
them .

”

Sir Henry was sitting Opposite to me in a Madeira chair

,

his armsleaning
on the table .
He now looked up

, ﬁxing

his large gray eyes full upon my face .
There was a curi

ous anxiety in them, I thought .

Did you happen to meet a man called Neville there ?
Oh , yes ; he outspanned alongside
of me for
a fort

night, to rest his oxen before going on to the interior.
I

had a letter from a lawyer, a few months back, asking m e

KIN G

if I knew what had become
of him, which I answered to

the b est of my ability at the time .

”

Yes,

” said Sir Henry,

“ your letter wasforwarded to

m e.
You said i n it that the gentleman called Neville left

Bamangwato in the beginning of May, in a wagon, with

a driver, a voorlooper, and a Kaﬂi r hunter called Jim, an

nou ncing his intention of trekking, if possible, as far
as

Inyati, the extreme trading

-post in the Matabele country,

where he would sell his wagon and proceed on foot .
You

also said that he did sell his wagon, for, six months after
wards, you
saw the wagon in the possession of a Portu

gu ese trader, WHOtold you that he had bought it at In
yati from a white man whose name he had forgotten, and
that the white man, with
a native servant, had started Off

for the interior on a shooting trip , he believed .

”

CCY es
‘

”

Then came a pause .

“ Mr. Quatermain,

” said Sir Henry, suddenly,

“ I
l up

pose you know or can guess nothing more of the reasons

of
m y— of Mr. Neville

’s journey to the northward, or
as

to what point that journey was directed ?

”

I heard something ,

” I answered, and
stopped.
The

subject wasone which I did not dare to discuss
.

Sir Henry and Captain Good looked
at each other, and

Captain Good nodded .

Mr. Quatermain , said the former,
I am going to tell

you a story, and ask your advice, and perhaps your assist

ance .
The
agent who forwarded me your letter told m e

that I might implicitly rely upon it, as you were,

” he said,

well known anduniversally respe cted in Natal, and espe

‘

cially noted for your discretion .

”

I bowed, and drank some whiskey

-and

-water to hide m y

’k

confusion, for I am a modest man ; and Sir Henry went

on

Mr. Neville was my brother.

“ Oh,

” I said, starting ; for n ow I knew who Sir Henry

had reminded
m e of when I ﬁrst saw him .
His brother

was a much smaller man and had a dark beard , but, now I
thought of it, he possessed eyes of the same shade of gray
and with the same keen look in them, and the features,
too, were not unlike .

He was,

” went on Sir Henry,
my only and younger

brother, and till ﬁve years ago I do not suppose we were

ever a month away from each other.
But just about ﬁve

years ago a misfortune befell
u s, as sometimes does hap

pen in families .
We had quarrelled bitterly, and I b e

haved very unjustly to my brother in my anger.

”
Here

Captain Good nodded his head vigorously to himself.
The ship gave a big roll just then, so that the looking
glass , which was ﬁxed Opposite us to starboard, was for a

m b m ent nearly over
ou r heads, and as I wassitting with

my h ands in my pockets and staring upward, I could see
him nodding like anything.

“ As I dare
say you know,
went on Sir Henry,

“ if a

man dies intestate, and has no property but land— real
property it is called in England

m
it all descends to his eld

est
son .
It so happened that just at the time when we

quarrelled
ou r father died intestate .
He had put
off

making his will until it was too late .
The result was that

my brother, who had not been brought up to any pr ofes

sion, was left without a penny .
Of course it would have

been my duty to provide for

‘ him , but at the time the

quarrel between us was
so bitter that I did
not— to my

shame I
say it (and he sighed deeply)— Offer to do any

KING SOLOMON

11

thing.
It was not that I grudged him anything, but I

waited for him to make advances, and he made none .
I

am sorry to trouble you with all this, Mr. Quatermain, but
I must, to make things clear ; eh , Good ?

”

“ Quite so, quite so,

” said the captain.
Mr. Quater

main will, I am sure, keep this history to himself.

“ Of course,

” said I, for I rather pride myself
on my

discretion .

“ Well,

” went on Sir Henry,
my brother had a few

hundred pounds to his account
at the time, and without

saying anything to me he drew out this paltry su m
, and,

having adopted the name of Neville, started oﬁ for South
Africa in the wild hope
of making a fortune .
This I

heard afterwards .
Some three years passed, and I heard

nothing
of my brother, though I wrote several times .

Doubtless the letters never reached hi m
.
But as time

went
on I grew more and more troubled about him .
I

found
ou t, Mr. Quatermain, that blood is thicker than

water.

”

“ That

’s true,
said I, thinking of my boy Harry .

I found ou t, Mr. Quatermain , that I would have given

half my fortune to know that my brother George, the
only relation I have, was safe and well, and that I should
see him again .

“ But you never did, Curtis,
jerked ou t Captain Good,

glancing at the big man

’s face .

Well , Mr. Quatermain, as time went on I became more

and more anxious to ﬁnd ou t if my brother was alive
or

dead

, and, if alive , to get him home again .
I set inquiries

On foot

, and your lette r was one of the results .
So far as

it went it was satisfactory, for it showed that till lately
George was alive ; but it did not go far enough .
So, to

land.
It was such a man as this who ﬁrst told me the

legend of Solomon

’s Mines, now a matter
of nearly thirty

years ago .
It was when I was on my ﬁrst elephant

-hunt

in the Matabele country .
His name was Evans, and he

was killed next year, poor fellow, by a wounded buffalo,
and lies buried near the Zambesi Falls .
I was telling

Evans one night, I remember, of some wonderful workings
I had found While hunting koodoo and eland in what is
now the Lydenburg di strict
of the Transvaal .
I see they

have come across these workings again lately in prospect
ing for gold, but I knew
of them years ago .
There is a

great wide wagon -road cut ou t of the solid rock, and lead
ing to the mouth Of the working
or gallery.
Inside the

mouth of this gallery are stacks
of gold quartz piled
u p

ready for crushing, which shows that the workers, who
ever they were, must have left in a hurry, and about
twenty paces i n the gallery is built across, and a beautiful
bit of masonry it is .

Ay,

’ said Evans,
but I will tell you a queerer thing

than that
and he went
on to tell me how he had found

in the far interior a ruined city, which he believed to be
the Ophir
of the Bible— and, by the way, other more

learned men have said the same long Since poor Evane

’s

time .
I was , I remember, listening open ~ear ed to all these

wonders, for I was young at the time, and this story of an
ancient civilization, and
of the treasure which those
old

Jewish or Phoenician adventurers used to extract from a
country long since lapsed into the darkest barbarism, took
a great hold upon my imagination, when suddenly he said
to me,

‘ Lad, did you ever hear
of the Suliman Mountains

up to the northwest of the Mashukulu m bwe country?

’

I told him I never had.

‘ Ah, well,

’ he
said,

‘ that was

KIN G SOLOMON

where Solomon really had his mines— his diamond mines,
I mean .

’

How do you know that ?

’ I asked .

Know it ? why, what is
Suliman ” but a corruption

of Solomon ? ! and , besides , an old Isanu si (witch doctor)
up in the Manica country told me all about it .
She said

that the people who lived across those mountains were a
branch
of the Zulus, speaking a dialect of Zulu, but ﬁner

and bigger men even ; that there lived among them great
wizards, who had learned their art from white men when

“ all the world was dark,

” and who had the secret
of a

wonderful mine of
bright stones .

”

Well, I laughed at this story at the time, though it in

ter ested me , for the diamond ﬁelds were
not discovered

then , and poor Evans went
off and got killed, and for

twenty years I never thought any more
of the matter.

But just twenty years afterwards —and that is a long
time, gentlemen ; an elephant

-hunter does not often live

for twenty years at his business— I heard something more
deﬁnite about Sulim an

’sMountains and the country which

lies beyond them .
I was up beyond the Manica country at

a place called Sitanda

’sKraal, and a miserable place it was ,

for one could get nothing to eat there, and there was but
little game about .
I had an attack of fever, and was in a

bad way generally, when one day a Portugee arrived with
a single companion— a half

-breed .
N ow I know your

Delagoa Portugee well .
There is no greater devil

agony and ﬂesh in the shape of slaves .

customed to meet ; he reminded me more
of the polite

dons I have read about.
He was tall and thin, with large

dark eyes and curling gray mustache.
We talked to

gether a little, for he could speak broken English, and I
understood a little Portugee, and he told me that
his

name was José Silvestre, and that he had a place near

Delagoa Bay ; and when he went
on next day, with his

half -breed companion , he said,
Good

-b y e,

’ taking
Off his

hat quite in the
old style .

‘ Good

-bye, senor,

’ he said ;

‘ if ever we meet again I shall be the richest man in the
world, and I will remember you.

’
I laughed a little— I

was too weak to laugh much— and watched him strike out
for the great desert to the west, wondering if he was mad ,

or what he thought he was going to ﬁnd there .

“ A week passed,
and I got the better
of my fever.

One evening I was sitting
on the ground in front
of the

little tent I had with me, chewing the last leg of a miser

able fowl I had bought from a
native for a bit
of cloth

worth twenty fowls, and staring at the hot, red su n sink

ing down into the desert, when suddenly I saw a ﬁgure,

apparently that of a European , for it wore a coat

, on the

l
pe
of the rising ground Opposite to
m e, about three

hundred yards away . The ﬁgure crept along on its hands

andknees , then it got up and staggered along a few yards
on its legs, only to fall and crawl along again .
Seeing

that it must be somebody in distress, I sent
one
of my

hunters to help hi m
, and presently he arrived, and who do

you suppose it turned out to be

José Silvestre, of course,
said Captain Good.

Yes, José Silvestre, or rather his skeleton and a little

skin .
His face was bright yellow with bilious fever

, and

hislarge, dark eyes stood nearly out
of hishead

, for
all

KIN G SOLOMON

’S MIN E S .
17

hisﬂesh had gone
There was nothing but yellow, parch

m ent

-like skin , white hair, and the gaunt bones sticking
up beneath .

Water !for the sake of Christ, water
he moaned .

I saw that his lips were cracked, and his tongue, which

protruded between them, was swollen and blackish .

I gave him water with a little milk in it, and he drank

it in great gulps, two quarts or more, without stopping.
I would not let him have any more .
Then the fever took

him again , and he fell down and began to rave about Suli
man

’s Mountains, and the diamonds, and the desert.
I

took him into the tent and did what I could for him,
which
was little enough ; but I saw how it must end.

About eleven o

’clock he got quieter, and I lay down for a

little rest and went to sleep .
At dawn I woke again, and

saw him in the half light sitting up, a strange, gaunt
form
, and gazing
ou t towards the desert .
Presently the

ﬁrst ray of the sun shot right across the wide plain before

ustill it reached the far

-away crest of one of the tallest of

the Suliman Mountains, more than a hundred miles away.

“
‘ There it is
cried
the dying
m an in Portuguese,

stretching ou t his long , thin arm,

‘ but I shall never reach

it, never.
No one will ever reach it

Suddenly he paused , and seemed to take a resolution.

‘ Friend,

’ he said, turning towards me,

‘ ar e you there ?

My eyes grow dark .

’

Yes,

’ I said ;

‘ yes, lie down now, and rest .

’

Ay,

’ he answered,

‘ I Shall rest soon ; I have , time to

rest— all eternity .
Listen , I am dying ! You have been

good to me .
I will give you the paper . Perhaps you will

get there if you can live through the desert, whi ch has

killed m y poor servant and m e.

’

“ Then he groped in his shirt and brought
ou t what I

thought was a Boer tobacco

-pouch of the skin of the Swart

vet-pens (sable antelope)

.
It was fastened with a little

strip of hide, what we call a rimpi, and this he tried to
untie, but could not.
He handed it to me
Untie it,

’ he

said .
I did so, and extracted a bit of torn yellow linen,

on which something was written in rusty letters .
Inside

was a paper.

“ Then he went
on feebly, for he was growing weak

The paper has it all, that is on the rag . It took me years

to read .
Listen
my ancestor, a political refugee from

Lisbon and
one of the ﬁrst Portuguese who landed
on

these shores, wrote that when he was dying on those moun
tains which no white foot ever pressed before
or since .

His name was J osé da Silvestra, and he lived three hun
dred years
ago.
His slave, who waited for him on this

side the mountains, found him dead, and brought the
writing home to D elagoa.
It has been in the family ever

since, bu t none have cared to read it till at last I did .
And I have lost my life over it, but another may succeed ,
and become the richest man in the world— the richest man
in the world . Only give it to no one ; go yourself
Then

he began to wander again, and in an hour it was all over.

God rest him
he died very quietly, and I buried him

deep, with big boulders
on his breast
so I do not think

that the jackals can have dug him up.
And then I came

away.

Ay, but the document,

” said Sir Henry, in a tone of

deep interest .

Yes, the document ; what was in it ?

” added the captain .

“ Well, gentlemen, if you like I will tell you .
I have

never showed it to anybody yet except my dear wife, who

Half an hour after that I saw Neville

Off . Presently Jim came running back .
Good

’

he said .
I didn

’t like to start without bidding you good

bye, for I dare say you are right, and we shall never come
back again .

’

‘ Is your master really going to Su lim an

or are you lying ?

’

‘ N o ,

’says he ;

‘ he is going . He told me he was bound

to make his fortune somehow, or try to ; so he might as

’

Oh
said I ;

‘ wait a bit , Jim ; will you take a note

m e that to start
on such a journey would be to go to c e r

to support, I could not afford to die just then .

“ No, thank you , Sir Henry, I think I had rather not,

”

I answered .

“ I am too
old for wild

sort, and we should only end

Both Sir Henry and Captain Good looked very disap

said the former,

“ I am well oﬂ

I am bent upon this business .
You

Moreover, I will , before we start, arrange that in the event

You will
see from this how

necessary I think your presence .
Also, if by any chance

we should reach this place, and ﬁnd diamonds , they shall
belong to you and Good equally.
I do not want them .

But of course the chance is as good asnothing,though the
same thing would apply to any ivory we might get .

“ Sir Henry,

“ this is the most liberal Offer I

one not to be sneezed at by a poor hunter

and I must take time to think it over .
I will give you my

Very good,

Silvestre and the diamonds .

CHAP TER III.

O U R SE RVI CE .

IT takes from four to ﬁve days, according to the vessel

and the state of the weather, to run up from the Cape to
Durban .
Som etimes , if the landing is bad at East Lon

don , where they have not yet got that wonderful harbor
they talk so much of and sink

, such a mint
of money in,

one is delayed for twenty -four hours before the cargo
boats can get out to take the goods
off.
But on this occa

sion we had not to wait at all, for there were no breakers

on the bar to speak of, and the tugs came
ou t at once with

their long strings of ugly, ﬂat

-bottomed boats, into which

the goods were bundled with a crash .
It did not matter

what they were, over they went, slap -bang
whether they

were china or woollen goods they met with the same treat
ment .
I saw
one case containing four dozen
of cham

pagne smashed all to bits , and there was the champagne

ﬁ z z ingand boiling about in the bottom of the dirty cargo
boat.
It was a wicked waste, and so evidently the K afﬁ rs

in the boat thought, for they found a couple of unbroken
bottles, and knocking the tops off drank the contents .
But

they had not allowed for the expansion caused by the ﬁzz
in the wine, and feeling themselves swelling, rolled about
in the bottom of the boat, calling out that the good liquor
was

“ tagati

” (bewitched) .
I spoke to them from the ves

sel, and told them that it was the white man

’s strongest

m edicine, and that they were asgood asdead m en .
They

26
KING SOLOMON

went
on to the shore in a very great fright, and I do
not

think that they will touch champagne again .

Well, all
the tim e we were running up to Natal I was

thinking over Sir Henry Curtis

’s Offer .
Vile did not speak

any more on the subj ect for a day or two, though I told
them many hunting yarns , all true ones . There isno need
to tell lies about hunti ng, for so many curio u s things hap
pen within the knowledge of a
m
an whose business it is

to hunt ; b u t this is by the way

.

At last, one beautiful eveni ng in January , which is
ou r

hottest month , we steam ed along the coast of Natal , ex

pecting to
m ake Durban Point by sunset .
It is a lovely

coast all along from East Lo ndon , with i tsred sandhills
and wide sweeps
of
vivid green, do tted here and there

with K aﬂi r kraals, and bordered by a ribbon of white surf
which spouts up in pillars of fo am whe re it hi ts the rocks .
But just before you get to Durban there isa peculiar rich
ness about it.
There are the deep kloofs cut i n the b ills

by the rushn
rains
Of centuries , down which the rivers

Sparkle ; there is the
deepest green
of the bush , growing

asGod planted it, and the other greens of the mealie—gar
dens
and the sugar

-patches , while here and there a white

house, smiling out at the placid sea, puts a ﬁ nish and gives
an air of homelinessto the scene .
For to my mind, how

ever beautiful a view may be , it requires the presence
of

man to make it complete, but perhaps that is becau se I
have lived so much in the wilderness, and therefore know
the value Of civilization , though, to be sure, it drives away
the game .
The Garden of Eden, no doubt, was fair before

man was, but I always think i t m ust ha ve been fairer when
Eve was walking about it.
But we had m iscalculated a

little, and the su n was well down before we dropped

chor off the Point, and heard the gun which told the good
folk that the English mail was in .
It was
too late to

think of getting over the bar that night, so we went down
comfortably to dinner, after seeing the mail carried off in
the lifeboat .

When we came up again the moon was up, and shining

so brightly over sea and Shore that she almost palcd the
quick, large ﬂashes from the lighthouse.
From the shore

ﬂoated sweet Spicy odors that always remind me of hymns
and missionaries, and in the windows of the houses on the
Berea sparkle a hundred lights .
From a large brig lying

near came the

' m u si c of the sailors asthey worked at get

ting the anchor u p to be ready for the wind.
Altogether

it was a perfect night, such a night as you only get in

southern Africa, and it threw a garment
of peace over

everybody as the moon threw a garment
of silver over

everything .
EVen the great bulldog, belonging to a sport

ing passenger seem ed to y ield to the gentle inﬂuences,
and, giving u p yearning to come to close quarters with the

of the cabin , dreaming, no doubt, that he had ﬁnished him,
and happy in hi sdream .

We all

- that is, Sir Henry Curtis , Captain Good, and

went and sat by the wheel, and were quiet for a

while.

Well , Mr. Quaterm ain ,
said Sir Henry, presently,

“ No,

“ I accept them gladly.

There is the whole affair in a nutshell.

We ha ve all three

Next day we went ashore, and I pu t Sir H enry and

The curator of

the botanical gardens gave them to me .
It is looked after

Of the garden (for there

.

Well , to get on— for unless I do you will be tired of my

having once made u p my m ind to go, I set about making

First I got the deed from Sir

There

was some little difﬁculty about getting this legally ex

ecu ted, asSir Henry was a stranger here, and the property
to be charged was over the water ; but it was
ultimately

got over with the help
of a lawyer, who charged £20 for

the job
a price that I thought outrageous .
Then I got

my check for
£5 00.
Having paid this tribute to my

of caution , I bought a wagon and a span of oxen on

Sir Henry

’s behalf, and beauties they were .
It was a

twenty -two -foot wagon with iron axles, very strong, very
light

, and built throughout
of stink

-wood .
It was not

quite a new
one, having been to the Diamond Fields and

back

, but in my Opinion it was all the better for that, for

one could see that the wood was well

-seasoned .
If any

thing is going to give in a wagon, or if there is green wood
in it

, it will Show
ou t
on the ﬁrst trip .
It was what we

call a
“ half-tented

” wagon— that is to
say, it was only

covered in over the after twelve feet, leaving all the front

part free for the necessaries we had to carry with us .
In

this after part was a hide
cartle,
or bed, on which two

people could sleep , also racks for riﬂes, and many other
little conveniences .
I gave £ 125 for it, and think it was

cheap at the price .
Then I bought a beautiful team Of

twenty salted Zulu oxen , which I had had my eye
on for

a year
or two .
Sixteen oxen are the usual number for a

team, but I had four extra to allow for casualties .
These

Zulu oxen are small and light, not m ore than half the size

of the Africander oxen, which are generally used for trans
port purposes ;
b u t they will live where the Africander

will starve, and with a light load will make ﬁve miles a

day better going , being quicker
and not SO liable to get

footsore. What ismore, this lot were thoroughly

“ salted

— that is, they hadworked all over South Africa, and so had
become proof (comparatively spe aking) against red water,
which so frequently destroys whole teams
of o

‘xen when

they get on to strange
veldt

” (grass country)

.
As for

“ lung sick,

” which is a dreadful form of pneumonia, very

prevalent in this country, they had all been inoculated
against it .
This is done by cutting a slit in the tail of an

ox , and binding in a piece of the diseased lung of an animal
which has died
of the sickness .
The result isthat the o x

sickens, takes the disease in a mild form, which causes its
tail to drop
Off, as a rule about a foot from the root

, and

becomes proof against future attacks .
It seems cruel to

rob the animal of his tail , especially in a country where
there are so many ﬂies , but it isbetter to sacriﬁce the tail
and keep the
ox than to lose both tail and
o x , for a tail

without an ox is not much good except to dust with .
Still

it does look Odd to trek along behind twenty stumps

, where

there ought to be tails .
It seems as though nature had

made a triﬂing mistake, and stuck the stern ornaments of

a lot of prize bulldogs on to the rumps of the oxen .

Next came the question
of provisioning and medicines,

one which required the most careful consideration, for
what one had to do was to avoid lumbering the wagon up,
and yet take everything absolutely necessary.
Fortunate

ly, it turned ou t that Good was a bit of a doctor, having at
some period I n his previous career managed to pass through
a course of m edical and surgical instruction, which he had
more or less kept up .
He was not, of course , qualiﬁed, but

he knew more about it than many a man who could write
M .D . after his name, as we found
ou t afterwards, and he

had a Splendid travelling medicine

-chest and a set of i n

str u m ents
.
While we were at Durban he cut Oﬁ a K aﬂi r

’s

big toe in a way which it was a pleasure to see.
But he

was quite ﬂabbergasted when the
K aﬂi r , who had sat

stolidly watching the Operation , asked him to put
on an

other, saying that a
white one

” would do at a pinch .

There remained , when these questions were satisfacto

rily settled, two further important points for consideration,
namely, that of arms and that of servants . As to the arms
I cannot do better than put down a list Of those we ﬁnally
decided on from among the ample store that Sir Henry
had brought with him from England, and those which I
had .
I copy it from my pocket

-book, where I made the

entry at the time

Three heavy breechloading double

-eight elephant guns,

weighing about ﬁfteen pounds each, with a charge of eleven
drachms of black powder .

”
Two of these were by a well

known London ﬁrm , most excellent makers , but I do not

know by whom mine, which was
not so highly ﬁnished,

wasmade .
I had used it on several trips, and shot a good

many elephants with it, and it had always proved a most
superior weapon , thoroughly to be relied on .

Three double

for men, especially in an open cou ntry and with the sem i

One double No . 12 central

”
This gun proved of
the greatest

service to us afterwards in shooting game for the pot .

Three Winchester repeating riﬂes (not carbines) , spare

guns

“ Three single -action Colt

’s revolvers, with the heavier

pattern of cartridge .

”

This was ou r total armament, and the reader will doubt

less Observe that the weapons
of each class were
of the

same make and calibre, SO that the cartridges were inter
changeable, a very important point .
I make no
apology

for detailing it at length , for every experienced hunter
will know how vital a proper supply of guns and am m u ni
tion is to the success of an expedition .

Now as to the men who were to go with
u s
.
After

much consultation we decided that their number should
be limited to ﬁ ve, namely, a driver, a leade r, and three
servants .

The driver and leader I got without much difﬁculty,

two Zulus, named respectively Goza and Tom
; but the

servants were a more difﬁcult matter.
It was necessary

that they Should be thoroughly trustworthy and brave
men, as in a business
of this sort
ou r lives migh t depend

upon their conduct .
At last I secured two,
one a Hot

tentot called VentvOgel (wind

-bird) , and one a little Zulu

KING S OLOMON

’S MIN ES .
3 5

named Khiva, who had the merit of speaking English per

fectly

.
VentvOgel I had known before ; he was on e of the

most perfect
Spoorers

” (game

-trackers) I ever had to do

with , and tough as whipcord .
He never seemed to tire .

But he had
one failing , so common with his race, drink .

Put him within reach
of a bottle
of grog and you could

not trust him .
But as we were going beyond the region

of

’ grog

-Shops this little weakness
of his did
not so much

m atter.

Having got these two
m en I looked in vain for a third

to suit my purpose, so we determined to start without one,
trusting to luck to ﬁnd a suitable man On ou r way up coun
try .
But on the evening before the day we had ﬁxed for

our departure the Zulu Khiva Informed me that a man
was waiting to see me .
Accordingly when we had done

dinner, for we were at table at the time, I told him to
bring him
in .
Presently a very tall, handsome -looking

man, somewhere about thirty years of age, and very light
colored for a Zulu , entered, and, lifting his knob -stick by
way of salute, squatted himself down in the corner on his
haunches and sat silent.
I did not take any notice of him

for a while, for it is a great mistake to do
SO. If you rush

into conversation at once a Zulu is apt to think you a per

son of little dignity or consideration .
I observed , however,

that he was a
K eshla
(ringed man) , that is, that he wore

on his head the black ring
, made of a species of gum pol

ishedwith fat and worked in with the hair, usually assumed
by Zulus on attaining a certain age
or dignity.
Also it

struck me that his face was familiar to me.

“ Well,

” I said at last,
what is your name ?

Umbopa,

” answered the m an in a slow, deep voice .

I have seen your face before.

3 6
KING SOLOMO N

’S MIN ES .

Yes ;
the Inkoosi (chief) saw my face at the place

the Little Hand (Isandhlwana) the day before the battle .

Then I remembered .
I had been one of Lord Chelm s

ford

’s guides in that unl ucky Zulu war, and had had the

good -fortune to leave the camp in charge of some wagons
the day before the battle .
While I had been waiting for

the cattle to be inspanned I had fallen into conversation
with this man, who held some small command among the
native auxiliaries , and he had expressed to
m e his doubts

of the safety of the camp .
At the time I had told him to

hold his tongue, and leave such matters to wiser heads ;
but afterwards I thought of hiswords .

“ I remember,

” I said ;
what isit you want ?

”

“ It is this,
Mac u m az ahn

means the man who gets up in the middle of the night ; or,

There wasa certain assumption of dignity in the man ’s

Sir Henry walked up to him and looked

Umbopa evidently understood him , for he answered in

CHAPTER IV.

A N
E L E P H A N T
H U N T.

N ow I do not propose to narrate at full length all the

incidents
of our long journey up to Sitanda

’sKraal, near

the junction
of the Lukanga and Kalu kwe rivers, a jour

ney of more than a thousand miles from Durban, the last
three hundred or so of which, owing to the frequent pres
ence of the dreadful
tsetse
ﬂy, whose bite is fatal to all

animals except donkeys and men, we had to make on foot.

We left Durban at the end
of Janu ary,

° and it was in

the second week of May that we camped near Sitanda

’s

Kraal .
Our adventures
on the way were many and vari

ou s
, but as they were of the sort which befall every Afri

can hunter, I shall not— with
one exception to be present

ly detailed— set them down here, lest I should render this
history too wearisome .

At Inyati , the outlying trading station in the Matabele

country, of which Lobengula (a great scoundrel) is king ,
we with many regrets parted from ou r comfortable wagon .
Only twelve oxen remained to u s ou t of the beautiful span

of twenty which I had bought at Durban .
One we had

lost from the bite
of a cobra, three had perished from

po verty and the want of water, on e had been lost, and the
other three had died from eating the poisonous herb called

tulip .

”
Five more sickened from this cause, but we man

aged to cure them with doses of an infusion made by boil

ing down the tulip -leaves .
If administered in time this

40
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

isa very effective antidote .
The wagon and oxen we left

in the immediate charge
of Goza and Tom , the driver and

leader, both of them trustworthy boys, requesting a wor
thy Scotch missionary who lived in this wild place to keep
an eye to it .
Then, accompanied by Umbopa, Khiva,

VentvOgel, and half a dozen bearers whom we hired
on

the spot, we started
off on foot upon our wild quest .
I

remember we were all a little silent on the occasion
of

that departure, and I think that each of us was wonder
ing if we Should ever see that wagon again ; for my part
I never expected to .
For a while we tramped
on in Si

lence, till Umbopa, who was marching in front, broke into
a Zulu chant about how some brav e men, tired of life and
the tameness of things, started off into a great wilderness
to ﬁnd new things or die, and how, 10 , and behold !when
they had got far into the wilderness, they found it was
not a wilderness at all , but a beautiful place full of young
wives and fat cattle, of game to hunt and enemies to kill .

Then we all laughed and took it for a good omen .
He

was a cheerful savage, wasUmbopa, in a digniﬁed sort of
way, when he had not got
one
of his ﬁts of brooding,

and had a wonderful knack
of keeping one

’s Spirits up .

We all got very fond of him .

And now for the one adventure I am going to treat m y

self to, for I do heartily love a hunting yarn .

About a fortnight

’s
m arch from Inyati we came across

a peculiarly beautiful bit of fairly

-watered wooded coun

try . The kloofs in the hills were covered with dense bush ,

“ idoro

” bush as the
natives call it, and in some places

with the
wacht

-een

-beche
(wait

- a

-little) thorn , and there

were great quantities
of the beautiful

“
m achabell

” tree

,

laden with refreshing yellow fruit with enormous stones .

KIN G SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .
41

Thi s tree is the elephant

’s favorite food , and there were

not wanting signs that the great brutes were about, for
not only was their Spoor frequent , but in many places the
trees wer e b r oken down and even uprooted. The elephant
is a destructive feeder .

One evening, after a long day

’s march, we came to a

spot
of peculiar loveliness .
At
the foot
of a bush -clad

hill was a dry river -bed, in which , however, were
to be

found pools of crystal water all trodden round with the
hoof

- prints
of game .
Facing this hill was a parklike

plain , where grew clumps of ﬂat

-topped mimosa, varied

with occasional glossy

-leaved
m achab ells, and all round

was the great sea of pathless, silent bush .

As we emerged into this river

-bed path we suddenly

started a troop
of tall gi r aﬂ es, who galloped, or , rather,

sailed
off, with their strange gait, their tails screwed
u p

over their backs , and their hoofs rattling like castanets .
They were about three hundred yards from us, and there
fore practically out of Shot, but Good , who was walking
ahead and had an express loaded with solid ball in his

hand,

.could not resist, but upped gun and let drive at the

last, a young cow. By some ex tI aordinary chance the ball
struck it full on the back of the neck, Shatteri ng the spinal
column, and that giraffe went rolling head over heels just
like a rabbit .
I never saw a more curious thing.

C u rse it 1

” said Good -“ for I am sorry to say he had

a habit of using strong langu age when excited— contract
ed no doubt, in the course of hisnautical career ;
curse it ,

I

’ve killed him .

”

Ou, B ou gwan,
ejaculated the Kaﬁ

’i rs;
ou ! ou !

”

They called Good

“ B ougwan

” (glass eye) because
of

hiseyeglass .

42
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES.

Oh,
B ou gwan !

’
r e

-echoed Sir Henry and I ; and from

that day Good

’s reputation as a marvellous Shot was estab

lished, at any rate among the K aﬂi r s
.
Really he was
a

bad one, but whenever he missed we overlooked it for the
sake of that giraffe .

Having set some of the

“ boys
to
c u t off the best
of

the giraffe meat, we went to work to build a

“ scherm

”

near one of the pools about a hundred yards to the right

of it.
This is done by cutting a quantity of thorn bushes

and laying them in the Shape of a circular hedge .
Then

the space enclosed i ssmoothed, and dry tambouki grass, if
obtainable , ismade into a b ed in the centre , and a ﬁre
or

ﬁres lighted .

By the time
the
scherm
was ﬁnished the moon was

coming up , and
ou r
dinner
of giraffe steaks and roasted

marrow

-bones was ready . How we enjoyed those marrow

bones, though it wasrather a job to crack them ! I know
no greater luxury than giraffe
m arrow, unless it i s ele

phant

’s heart, and we had that on the morro w.
We ate

ou r simple
m eal , pausing at times to thank Good for his

wonderful Shot, by the light of the full m oon, and then we
began to smoke and yarn, and a curious picture we must
have made squatted there round the ﬁre .
I, with my short

grizzled hair sticking up straight, and Sir Henry with his
yellow locks, which were getting rather long, were rather
a contrast , especially as I am thin and short and dark,
weighing only nine stone and a half, and Sir Henry is tall
and broad and fair, and weighs ﬁfteen .
But perhaps the

most curious

-looking
of the three, taking
all the circum

stances of the case into consideration , was Captain John
Good, R.N . There he sat upon a leather bag, looking just
as though he had come in from a comfortable day

’s shoot

KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES.
43

i ngin a civilized country, absolutely clean, tidy, and well
dressed .
He had on a Shooting

-suit of brown tweed, with

a hat to match , and neat gaiters .
He was, as usual, beau

tifully shaven , his eyeglass and his false teeth appeared
to be in perfect order, and altogether he was the neatest
man I ever had to do with in the wilderness .
He even

had on a collar, of which he had a supply, made of white
gutta

-percha .

“ You see , they weigh
SO little,

” he said
to me, inno

cently, when I expressed my astonishment at the fact;

“ I

always liked to look like a gentleman .

”

Well, there we all
sat yarning away in the beautiful

moonlight, and watching the K afﬁ rsa few yards off suck
ing their intoxicating

“ daccha

” in a pipe
of which the

mouthpiece was made
of the horn
of an eland, till they

one by one rolled themselves up in their blankets and went
to sleep by the ﬁre, that is, all except Umbopa, who sat a
little apart (I noticed he never mixed much with the other

Kaﬂi rs) , his chin resting
on his hand, apparently thinking

deeply.

Presently, from the depths of the bush behind us came

a loud
woof !woof !

”
That

’s a lion,

” said I, and we all

started up to listen .
Hardly had we done so, when from

the pool, about a hundred yards off, came the strident trum
peting of an elephant .

“ U nku ngu nklovo ! U nku ngu n

klovo !

” (elephant !elephant !) whispered the K afﬁrs; and

a few minutes afterwards we saw a succession
of vast

shadowy forms moving Slowly from the direction
of the

water towards the bush .
Up jumped Good, burning for

slaughter

, and thinking, perhaps, that it was as easy to kill

elephant as he had found it to Shoot giraffe, but I caught
him by the arm and pulled him down .

K ING SOLOMON

’S MINE S .

“ It

’sno good,

” I said,

“ let them go .

“ It seems that we are in a paradise of game
I vote we

stop here a day or two, and have a go at them,
said Sir

Henry, presently.

I was rather surprised, for hitherto Sir Henry had
al

ways been for pushing on as fast as possible, more espe

ci ally since we had ascertained at Inyati that about two
years ago an Englishman of the name of Neville had sold
his wagon there, and gone
on up country ; but I suppose

his hunter instincts had got the better Of him .

Good jumped at the idea, for he waslonging to have a

go at those elephants ; and so, to speak the truth , did I,
for it went agai nst m y conscience to let such a herd as that
escape without having a pull at the m

“ All right, my hearties,

” said I .
I
think

' we want a

little recreation .
And now let

’s turn in, for we ought to

be oﬂ by dawn, and then perhaps we may catch them feed
ing before they move on .

”

The others agreed, and we proceeded to make prepara

tions .
Good took off his clothes, shook them, put hiseye

glass and his false teeth into hi strousers pocket, and, fold
ing them all u p neatly, placed them ou t of the dew under
a corner
of his mackintosh sheet .
Sir Henry and I con

tented ourselves with rougher arrangements , and were soon
curled up in ou r blankets and dropping oﬂ into the dream
less sleep that rewards the traveller .

Going, going, gO
—What wasthat ?

Suddenly from the direction of the water came a so und

of violent scufﬂing, and next instant there broke upon our
ears a succession of the most awful roars .
There wasno

mistaking what they came from
only a lion could make

such a noise as that.
We all jumped up and looked tow

46
K ING SOLOMON

'S MIN ES .

We had no difﬁculty in ﬁnding the broad elephant trail,

which VentvOgel, after examination , pronounced to have
been made by between twenty and thirty elephants, most

of them full

-grown bulls .
But the herd had moved
on

some way during the night, and it was nine o

’clock, and

already very hot, before, fro m
the broken trees, bruised

leaves and bark, and smoking dung, we knew we could not
be far off them .

Presently we caught sight
of the herd, numbering, as

VentvOgel had said, between twenty and thirty, standing
in a hollow, having ﬁnished their morning meal, and ﬂap
ping their great ears .
It was a Splendid sight.

They were about two hundred yards from us .
Taking

a handful
of dry grass I threw it into the air to see how

the wind was ; for if once they winded us I knew they
would be oﬂ before we could get a Shot .
Finding that, if

anything, it blew from the elephants to us, we crept stealth
ily on, and, thanks to the cover, managed to get within forty
yards
or
so
of the great brutes .
Just in front of us and

broadside on stood three Splendid bulls, one of them with
enormous tusks .
I whispered to the others that I would

take the middle
one ; Sir Henry covered the
one to the

left, and Good the hu ll with the big tusks .

Now,

” I whispered .

Boom !boom !boom !went the three heavy riﬂes, and

down went Sir Henry

’s elephant, dead as a hammer, shot

right through the heart .
Mine fell
on to its knees, and I

thought he was going to die, but in another moment he
was up and
off, tearing along straight past me .
AS he

went I gave him the second barrel in his ribs, and this
brought him down in good earnest .
Hastily slipping in

two fresh cartridges, I ran up close to him, and a ball

KING SOLOMON

47

through the brain put an end to the poor brute

’s struggles.

Then I turned to
se e how Good had fared with the big

bull , which I had heard screaming with rage and pain as I
ga ve
m ine its quietus .
On reaching the captain I found

him in a great state Of excitement . It appeared that on r e

ceivi ngthe bullet the bull had turned
and come straight

for his assailant , who had barely time to get out of his way,

and then charged blindly
on past him, in the direction of

ou r encampment.
Meanwhile the herd had crashed off in

wild alarm in the other direction .

For a while we debated whether to go after the wounded

bull
or follow the herd , and ﬁnally decided for the latter

alternative, and departed thinking that we had seen the
last of those big tusks .
I have often wished since that we

had .
It was easy work to follow the elephants , for they

had left a trail like a carriage

-road behind them, crushing

down the thick bush in their furious ﬂight as though it
were tambouki grass .

B ut to come up with them was another matter, and we

had struggled on under a broiling sun for over two hours
before we found them .
They were , with the exception of

one bull, standing together, and I could see, from their
unquiet way and the manner in which they kept lifting
their trunks to test the air, that they were on the lookout
for mischief .
The solitary bull stood ﬁfty yards or so this

side of the herd, over which he was evidently keeping sen
try, and about sixty yards from us .
Thinking that he

would see
or wind us, and that it would probably start

them all
off again if we tried to get nearer, especially as

the ground was rather open, we all aimed at this bull and,
at my whispered word, ﬁred .
All three shots took effect,

and down he went, dead.
Again the herd started on, but,

48
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

unfortunately for them, about a hundred yards farther on
was a nullah ,
or dried water

-track , with steep banks, a

place very much resembling the one the Prince Imperial
was killed in in Zululand . Into this the elephants plunged,
and when we reached the edge we found them struggling
in wild confusion to get u p the other bank, and ﬁlling the
air with their screams, and trumpeting asthey pushed one
another aside in their selﬁsh panic, just like so many human
beings .
Now was
ou r opportunity, and, ﬁring away as

quick as we could load, we killed ﬁve of the poor beasts,
and no doubt should have bagged the whole herd had
they not suddenly given up their attempts to climb the
bank and rushed headlong down
the nullah .
We were

too tired to follow them , and perhaps also a little sick
of

slaughter, eight elephants being a pretty good bag
for

one day.

SO, after we had rested a little
and the K aﬁi rshad cut

ou t the hearts
of two of the dead elephants for supper, we

started homeward, very well pleased with o u rselves, hav
ing made up
ou r minds to send the bearers
0 11 the morrow

to chop
ou t the tusks .

Shortly after we had passed the spot where Good had

wounded the patriarchal bull we came across a herd
of

eland, but did not shoot at them, as we had already plenty

of meat .
They trotted past
u s, and then stopped behind

a little patch
of bush about a hundred yards away and

wheeled round to look at us .
As Good was anxious to

get a near View Of them , never having seen an eland close

,

he handed his riﬂe to U m bopa,
and, followed by Khiva

,

strolled up to the patch of bush . We sat down and waited

for him, not sorry
of the excuse for a little rest .

The sun was just going down in its reddest glory

, and

KIN G SOLOMON

49

Sir Henry and I were admiring the lovely scene, when sud

denly we heard an elephant scream, and saw its huge and
charging form with uplifted trunk and tail silhouetted
against the great red globe
of the su n .
Next second we

saw something else, and that was Good and Khiva tearing
back towards us with the wounded bull (for it was he)
charging after them .
For a moment we did
not dare to

ﬁr e— though it would have been little use if we had at that
distance— for fear
of hitting
one of them, and the next a

dreadful thing happened : Good fell a victim to his passion
for civilized dress .
Had he consented to discard his trou

sers and gaiters as we had, and hunt in a ﬂannel shirt and
a pair
of
veldtschoons
, it would have been all right, but

as it was hi strousers cumbered him in that desperate race,
and presently, when he was about sixty yards from us, his
boot, polished by the dry grass, Slipped, and down he went

on his face right in front of the elephant .

We gave a gasp, for we knew he must die, and ran
as

hard as we could towards him .
In three seconds it had

ended, but
not as we thought .
Khiva, the Zulu boy, had

seen his master fall, and, brave lad that he was, had turned
and ﬂung hisassegai straight into the elephant

’s face . It

stuck in his trunk .

With a scream
of pain the brute seized the poor Zulu ,

hurled him to the earth , and, placing his huge foot
on to

his body about the middle, twined his trunk round his u p
per part and tor e hi m
i n two.

We rushed up , mad with horror, and ﬁred again and

again , and presently the elephant fell upon the fragments
of the Zulu .

As for Good, he got up and wrung his hands over the

brave man who had given his life to save him ; andmyself,

though an old hand, I felt a lump in my throat .
Umbopa

stood and contemplated the huge dead elephant and the
mangled remains of poor Khiva .

Ah, well
he said, presently,
he is dead, but he died

like a man .

CHAPTER V

O U R MARCH IN TO
TH E DESERT.

WE had killed nine elephants, and it took us two days

to cut
ou t the tusks and get them home and bury them

carefully in the sand under a large tree, which made a con

Spicu ou smark for miles round .
It was a wonderfully ﬁne

lot of ivory . I never saw a better, averaging as it did b e
tween forty and ﬁfty pounds a tusk .
The tusks of the

great bull that killed poor Khiva scaled one hundred and
seventy pounds the pair, as nearly as we could judge .

As for Khiva himself, we buried what remained of him

in an ant

-bear hole, together with an assegai to protect

himself with
on his journey to a better world .
On the

third day we started
on, hOping that we might
one day

return to dig up ou r b uried ivory, and in du e course, after
a long and wearisome tramp , and many adventures which
I have not space
to detail, reached Sitanda

’s Kraal, near

the Lukanga River, the real starting

-point
of
ou r expedi

tion.
Very well do I recollect
ou r arrival at that place .

To the right was a scattered native settlement with a few
stone cattle kraals and some cultivated lands down by the
water, where these savages grew their scanty supply Of
grain, and beyond it great tracts
of waving
veldt
cov

ered with tall grass, over which herds of the smaller game
were wandering .
To the left was the vast desert .
This

spot appeared to be the outpost of the fertile country, and

it would be difﬁcult to sax to what natural causes such an

5 2

‘KING S OLOM ON

’S MIN E S .

abrupt change in the character of the soil was due .
But

so it was .
Just below our encampment ﬂowed a little

stream, on the farther Side of which wasa stony slope, the
same down which I had twenty years before seen poor
Silvestre creeping back after his attem pt to reach Solo
mon

’s Mines, and beyond that m pe began the waterless

desert covered with a species of karoo Shrub . It was even

ingwhen we pitched our camp, and the great ﬁery ball of
the sun was sinking into the desert, sending glorious rays

of many

-colored light
ver all the vast expanse .

Leaving Good to sup
the arrangement of ou r little

cam p, I took Sir Henry with me , and we walked to the top

of the slope opposite and gazed out across the desert. The
air was very clear, and far, far away I could distinguish
the faint blue outlines , here and there capped with white,
Of the great Suliman Berg .

“ There,

” I said,

“ there is the wall of Solomon

’s Mines

,

but God knows if we shall ever climb it.

”

“ My brother should be there, and if he is I shall reach

him somehow,

” said Sir Henry, in that tone of quiet con

ﬁdence which marked the man .

“ I hope so,

” I answered, and turned to go back to the

camp, when I
saw that we were not
alone .
Behind
u s,

also gazing earnestly towards the far

- Off mou ntains

, was

the great Zulu, Umbopa .

The Zulu Spoke when he saw that I had observed him

,

but addressed himself to Sir Henry, to whom he had
at

tached himself.

“ IS it to that land that thou wouldst journey

, In cub u ?

(a native word meaning, I believe, an elephant

, and the

name given to Sir Henry by the K afﬁr s) he said

, pointing

towards the mountains with his broad assegai .

5 4
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN E S .

How do you know it was my brother ?

” asked Sir

Henry.

Nay, I know not .
But the man , when I asked what

the white man was like, said that he had your eyes and a
black beard .
He said, too, that the name
of the hunter

with him was Jim, that he was a Bechuana hunter and
wore clothes .

”

“ There is no doubt about it,

” said I ;

“ I knew Jim

well .

Sir Henry nodded .
I was sure
of it,

” he said.

“ If

George set his mind upon a thing he generally did it .
It

was always so from his boyhood .
If he meant to cross

the Suliman Berg he has crossed it, unless some accident

hasovertaken him, and we must look for him on the other
Side .

”

Umbopa understood English , though he rarely spoke it.

“ It is a far journey, I ncub u ,

” he put in, and I trans

lated his remark .

Yes,

” answered Sir Henry,
it is far.
But there is no

journey upon this earth that a man may
not make if he

sets his heart to it .
There is nothing, Umbopa, that he

cannot do, there are no mountains he may not climb , there
are no deserts he cannot cross, save a mountain and a
desert of which you are Spared the knowledge, if love
leads him, and he holds his life in his hand counting it
as nothing, ready to keep it or to lose it as Providence
may order.

”

I translated .

Great words, my father,
answered the Zulu (I always

called him a Zulu , though he was not really one) ,

“ great,

swelling words, ﬁt to ﬁll the mouth
of a man .
Thou art

right, my father Incub u .
Listen ! what is life ?
It

a feather ; it is the seed of the grass, blown hither and
thither, sometimes multiplying itself and dying in the act,
sometimes carried away into the heavens .
But if the seed

be good and heavy it may perchance travel a little way on
the road it will .
It is well to try and journey one

’s road

and to ﬁght with the air.
Man must die .
At the worst

he can but die a little sooner.
I will go with thee across

the desert and over the mountains, unless perchance I fall
to the ground on the way, my father.

”

He paused awhile, and then went
on with
one of those

strange bursts
of rhetorical eloquence which Zulus some

times indulge in, and which, to my mind, full as they are

of vain repetitions , Show that the race is by no means de
void of poetic instinct and
of intellectual power.

“ What is life
Tell me, 0 white men, who are wise,

who know the secrets of the world, and the world of stars,
and the world that lies above and around the stars ; who
ﬂash their words from afar without a voice ; tell me, white
men, the secret of ou r life— whither it goes and whence it

It is the glow

of the oxen in winter ; it is the little shadow that

runs across the grass and loses itself at sunset .

“ You are a strange man,

” said
Sir Henry, when he

ceased .

5 6
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

Umbopa laughed .
It seems to me that we are much

alike, Incub u .
Perhaps I seek a brother over the moun

tains .

I looked at him suspiciously.

“ What dost thou mean ?

I asked

“ what dost thou know of the mountains ?

”

A little ; a very little .
There is a strange land there,

a land of witchcraft and beautiful things ; a land of brave
people and of trees and streams and white mountains and
of a great white road .
I have heard of it .
But what - Is

the good of talking ? it grows dark .
Those who live to

see will see .

Again I looked at him doubtfully .
The man knew too

much .

Ye need not fear me, Macu m az ahn,

” he said, interpret

ing my look .

“ I dig no holes for ye to fall in .
I make

no plots .
If ever we cross those mountains behind the

sun, I will tell what I know.
But death Sits upon them.

Be wise, and turn back .
Go and hunt elephant .
I have

spoken.

”

And without another word he lifted his spear in saluta

tion and returned towards the camp, where Shortly after
wards we found him cleaning a gun like
any other Kafﬁr .

“ That is an odd man,

” said Sir Henry

.

Yes,

” answered I,
too odd by half.
I don

’t like his

little ways .
He knows something, and won

’t Speak
ou t.

But I s uppose it is no u se quarrelling with him .
We are

in for a curious trip, and a mysterious Zulu won’t make
much difference one way or another.

”

Next day we made
ou r arrangements for starting.
Of

course it was impossible to drag ou r heavy elephant riﬂes
and other kit with us across the desert, so, dismissing
ou r

bearers, we made an arrangement with an old native who

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
7

had a kraal close by to take care of them till we returned.
It went to my heart to leave such things as those sweet
tools to the tender mercies
of an
old thief, of a savage

whose greedy eyes I could see gloating over them .
But

I took some precautions .

First of all I loaded all the riﬂes , and informed him that

if he touched them they would go off .
He instantly tried

the experiment with my eight -bore, and it did go off, and
blew a hole right through
one
of his oxen , which were

just then being driven up to the kraal , to say nothing
of

knocking him head over heels with
the recoil .
He got

u p considerably startled, and not at all pleased at the loss

of the
ox , which he had the impudence to ask me to pay

for, and nothing would induce him to touch them again .

“ Put the live devils up there in the thatch ,

” he said,

out of the way, or they will kill us all .
Then I told him that if, when we came back, one
of

those things was missing I would kill him and all his peo

ple by witchcraft ; and if we died and he tried to steal the
things, I would come and haunt him and turn his cattle
mad and his milk sour till life was a weariness, and
m ake

the devils in the guns come out and talk to him in a way
he would not like, and generally gave him a good idea of
judgment to come .
After that he swore he would look

after them as though they were his father

’s Spirit .
He

was a very superstitious old K afﬁr and a great villain .

Having thus disposed
of
ou r superﬂuous gear we ar

ranged the kit we ﬁ ve— Sir Henry, Good, myself, Umbo
pa, and the Hottentot VentvOgel— were to take with us

on
ou r journey .
It was small enough, but do what we

would we could not get it down under about forty pounds
a man .
This is what it consisted
of:

5 8
KING SOLOMO N

’S MIN ES .

The three express riﬂes and two hundred rounds of am

«

munition .

The two Winchester repeating riﬂes (for Umbopa and

Ventvogel) , with two hundred rounds of cartridge .

Three

“ Colt
revolvers and sixty rounds
of cartridge .

Five Cochrane

’s water

-bottles, each holding four pints .

Five blankets.
Twenty -ﬁve pounds

’ weight of biltong (su n -dried game

ﬂesh) .

Ten pounds

’ weight of best mixed beads for gifts .

A selection
of medicine, including an ounce of quinine,

and one or two small surgical instruments.

Our knives, a few sundries, such
asa compass, matches,

a pocket

-ﬁlter , tobacco, a trowel, a bottle
of brandy, and

the clothes we stood in .

This was
ou r total equipment, a small
one, indeed, for

such a venture, but we dared not attempt to carry more .
As it was, that load was a heavy
one per man to travel

across the burning desert with, for in such places every
additional ounce tells upon one .
But try as we would we

could not see our way to reducing it .
There was nothing

but what was absolutely necessary.

With great difﬁculty, and by the promise
of a present

of a good hunting

-knife each, I succeeded in persuading

three wretched natives from the village to come with us

for the ﬁrst stage, twenty miles, and to carry each a large
gourd holding a gallon of water .
My object was to
eu

able
u S to reﬁll
ou r water

-bottles after the ﬁrst night

’s

march, for we determined to start in the cool of the night .
I gave out to these natives that we were going to shoot

ostriches, with which the, desert abounded .
They jab

b ered and shrugged their Shoulders, and said we were

KING SOLOMO N

’S MIN ES .
so

mad and should perish of thirst, which I m ust say seemed

very probable ; but being desirous of obtaining the knives,
which were almost unknown treasures up there , they con
sented to come, having probably reﬂected that, after all,

ou r subsequent extinction would be no affair of theirs .

All next day we rested and slept, and at sunset ate a

hearty meal of fresh beef washed down with tea, the last,

asGood sadly remarked, we were likely to drink for many
a long day .
Then, having made ou r ﬁnal preparations, we

lay down and waited for the moon to rise .
At last, about

nine o

’clock, up she came in all her chastened glory, ﬂood

ing the wild country with silver light, and throwing a
weird sheen
on the vast expanse
of rolling desert before

u s
, which looked as solemn and quiet and as alien to man

as the star

-studded ﬁrm am ent above .
We rose up , and in

a few minutes were ready, and yet we hesitated a little, as
human nature is prone to hesitate
on the threshold of

' am

irrevocable step .
We three white m en stood there by ou r

selves .
Umbopa, assegai in hand and the riﬂe across his

shoulders, a few paces ahead
of us, looked
ou t ﬁxedly

across the desert ; the three hired natives, with the gourds

of water, and VentvOgel were gathered in a little knot
behind .

Gentlemen,
said Sir Henry, presently, in his low, deep

voice,

“ we are going on about as strange a journey as men

can make in this world .
It is very doubtful if we can

succeed in it .
But we are three men who will stand to

gether for good O
r for evil to the last .
And now before

we start let us for a moment pray to the Power who
shapes the destinies
of men, and who
ages since
has

m arked
ou t
ou r paths, that it may please him to direct

ou r steps in accordance with his will .

60
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

Taking
Off his hat he, for the space of a minute
or so,

covered his face with his hands, and Good and I did like
wise .

I do not say that I am a ﬁrst

-rate praying

-man ; few

hunters are ; and as for Sir Henry, I never heard him speak
like that before , and only once Since, though deep down
in his heart I believe he is very religious .
Good, too, is

pious, though very apt to swear.
Anyhow I do not think

I ever, excepting
on
one single occasion , put in a better

prayer in my life than I did during that minute, and some
how I felt the happier for it .
Our future was
so
com

pletely unknown, and I think the unknown and the awful
always bring a man nearer to hisMaker.

“ And now,

” said Sir Henry,

“ trek .

”

So we started .
We had nothing to guide ourselves by except the dis

tant mountains and
old José da Silvestr a

’s chart, which ,

considering that it was drawn by a dying and half dis

tr aught man
on a fragment
of linen three centuries ago

,

was not a very satisfactory sort of thing to work
on . Still,

such as it was, ou r sole hope of success depended on it . If
we failed in ﬁnding that pool of bad water which the old
don marked as being situated in the middle of the desert

,

about Sixty miles from our starting

-point and as far from

the mountains, we must in all probability perish miserably

of thirst.
And to my mind the chances
of our ﬁnding it

in that great sea
of sand and karoo scrub seemed almost

inﬁnitesimal .
Even supposing Da Silvestra had marked it

right, what was there to prevent its having been genera
tions ago dried up by the sun, or trampled in by game

, or

ﬁlled with drifting sand ?

On we tramped silently as shades through the night and

6 2
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

ou t to the others that it wasall right, I ran towards Good,
much afraid lest he should be hurt, but to my great relief
found him sitting in the sand, his eye

-glass still ﬁxed ﬁrm

ly in his eye , rather Shaken and very mu ch startled, but
not in any way injured .

After this we travelled on without any further
m isad

venture till after
one o

’clock, when we called a halt, and

having drunk a little water, not much , for water was pre
cions, and rested for half an hour, started on again .

On, on we went, till at last the east began to blush like

the cheek of a girl .
Then there came faint rays of prim

rose light that changed presently to golden bars , through
which the dawn glided
ou t across the desert.
The stars

grew pale and paler still till at last they vanished ; the
golden moon waxed wan , and her mountain ridges stood

ou t clear against her sickly face like the bones
on
the

face of a dying man ; then came spear upon Spear of glori

ou s light ﬂashing far away across the boundless wilder
ness, piercing and ﬁring the veils of mist till the desert
was draped in a tremulous golden glow, and it was day.

Still we did not halt, though by this time we should

have been glad enough to do so, for we knew that when
once the sun was fully up it would be almost impossible

for us to travel in it.
At length, about
six
o

’clock, we

spied a little pile
of rocks rising
ou t
of the plain , and to

this we dragged ourselves .
AS luck would have it, here

we found an overhanging slab
of rock carpeted beneath

with smooth sand, which afforded a most grateful Shelter
from the heat .
Underneath this we crept, and having

drank some water each and eaten a bit of biltong, we lay

down and were soon sound asleep .

It was three o

’clock in the afternoon before we woke, to

KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .
6 3

ﬁnd ou r three bearers preparing to return .
They had al

ready had enough of the desert, and no number of knives
would have tempted them to come a step farther.
So we

had a hearty drink, and, having emptied ou r water -bottles,
ﬁlled them up again from the gourds they had brought
with them, and then watched them depart on their twenty
miles

’ tramp home .

At half

-pas
t four we also started on .
It was lonely and

desolate work, for , with the exception of a few ostriches,
there was not a single living creature to be seen on all the

vast expanse of sandy plain .
It was evidently too dry for

game, and, with the exception
of a deadly

-looking cobra

or two, we saw no reptiles .
One insect, however, was

abundant, and that was the common or house ﬂy.
There

they came,

“ not as single Spies, but in battalions,
as I

think the Old Testament says somewhere .
He is an ex

tr aordinar y animal , is the house ﬂy.
Go where you will

you ﬁnd him, and so it must always have been . I have seen
him enclosed in amber which mu st, I was told, have been
half a million years
old, looking exactly like his descend

ant
of to

-day, and I have little doubt that when the last

man lies dying
on the earth he will be buzzing round

if that event should happen to occur in summer— watch
ing for an opportunity to settle on his nose .

At sunset we halted, waiting for the moon to rise .
At

ten she came up beautiful and serene as ever, and, with

one halt about two O

’clock in the morning, we trudged

wearily on through the night, till at last the welcome sun

pu t a period to
ou r labors .
We drank a little and ﬂung

ourselves down , thoroughly tired
out,
on the sand, and

were soon all asleep .
There was no
need to set a watch,

for we had nothing to fear from anybody or anything in

64
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

that vast, untenanted plain .
Our only enemies were heat,

thirst, and ﬂies, but far rather would I have faced any

danger from man
or beast than that awful trinity .
This

time we were not so lucky as to ﬁnd a Sheltering rock to
guard us from the glare
of the su n, with the result that

abo ut seven o

’clock we woke up experiencing the exact

sensations one would attribute to a beefsteak on a gridiron .
We were literally being baked through and through .
The

burning sun seemed to be sucking
ou r very blood
ou t of

us
We sat up and gasped .
Phew
said I, grabbing at the halo of ﬂies which

buzzed cheerfully round my head .
The heat did not af

feet them .

My word,

” said Sir Henry.

“ It i shot !

” said Good .

It was hot, indeed, and there was not a bit
of shelter to

be had .
Look where we would there was no rock or tree ;

nothing but an unending glare, rendered dazzling by the
hot air which danced over the surface
of the desert as it

does over a red

-hot stove .

“ What is to be done ?

” asked Sir Henry ;
we can’t

stand this for long .

We looked at each other blankly .

“ I have it,

” said Good ;

“ we must dig a hole and get

into it, and cover ourselves with the karoo bushes .

”

It did not seem a very promising suggestion, but at least

it was better than nothing, so we set to work, and, with
the trowel we had brought with us and our hands, suc

ceeded in about an hour in delving ou t a patch of ground
about ten feet long by twelve wide to the depth of two
feet .
Then we cu t a quantity of low scrub with our hunt

ing

-knives, and, creeping into the hole, pulled it over us all

,

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
65

with the exception of Ventvogel, on whom, being a Hot

tentot, the sun had no particular effect.
This gave us

some slight shelter from the burning rays of the sun, but
the heat in that amateur grave can be better imagined
than described .
The Black Hole
of Calcutta must have

been a fool to it
indeed, to this moment, I do not know

how we lived through the day.
There we lay panting,

and every now and again moistening our lips from
ou r

scanty supply of water.
Had we followed our inclinations

we should have ﬁnished off all we had in the ﬁrst two hours,
but we had to exercise the most rigid care, for if ou r wa
ter failed
u swe knew that we must quickly perish miser

ably.

But everything has an end, if only you live long enough

to see it, and somehow that miserable day wore on towards
evening.
About three o

’clock in the afternoon we deter

mined that we could stand it no longer.
It would be bet

ter to die walking than to be Slowly killed by heat and
thirst in that dreadful hole .

‘So, taking each of us a little

drink from
ou r fast diminishing supply
of water
now

heated to about the same temperature as a
m an

’s blood,

we staggered on.

We had now covered some ﬁfty miles of desert.
If my

reader will refer to the rough copy and translation of old
Da Silvestr a

’s map he will see that the desert is marked

as b eIng forty leagues across, and the

“ p an bad water

isset down as being abou t in the middle of it .
N ow, forty

leagues is one hundred and twenty miles ; consequently, we

ought at the most to be within twelve
or ﬁfteen miles
of

the water, if any should really exist .

Through the afternoon we crept Slowly and painfully

along

, scarcely doing more than a mile and a half an hour.

6 6
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

At sunset we again rested, waiting for the moon, and, af
ter drinking a little, managed to get some sleep .

Before we lay down Umbopa pointed out to us a Slight

and indistinct hillock on the ﬂat surface of the desert about
eight miles away .
At the distance it looked like an ant

hill, and as I was dropping off to sleep I fell to wondering
what it could be .

With the moon we started on again , feeling dreadfully

exhausted, and suffering tortures from thirst and prickly
heat .
Nobody who has not felt it can know what we

went through .
We no longer walked, we staggered, now

and again falling from exhaustion, and being obliged
to

call a halt every hour
or so.
We had scarcely energy left

i n us to speak .
Up to now Good had chatted and joked,

for he was a merry fellow
but now he had not a joke left

in him .

At last, about two o

’clock, utterly worn ou t in body and

mind, we came to the foot
of this queer hill, or sand kop

pie, which did at ﬁrst sight resemble a gigantic ant

-heap

about a hundred feet high, and covering at the base nearly
a morgen (two acres)
of ground.

Here we halted,
and, driven by
ou r desperate thirst,

sucked down ou r last drops of water.
We had but half a

pint a head, and we could each have drank a gallon .

Then we lay down .
Just as I was dropping off to sleep

I heard Umbopa remark to himself in Zulu ,

“ If we cannot ﬁnd water we shall all be dead before the

moon rises to -morrow .”

I shuddered, hot as it was .
The near prospect
of such

an awful death is not pleasant, but even the thought of it

could not keep me from Sleeping .

CHAPTER VI.

W A T E R ! W A T E R !

IN two hours

’ time , about four o

’clock, I woke up

.
As

soon as the ﬁrst heavy demand of bodily fatigue had been
satisﬁed the torturing thirst from which I was suffering
asserted itself.
I could Sleep no more .
I had been dream

ing that I was bathing in a running stream with green
banks, and trees upon them, and I awoke to ﬁnd myself in
that arid wilderness, and to remember that, as Umbopa
had said, if we did not ﬁnd water that day we must cer

tai nly perish miserably .
N O human creature could live

long without water in that heat .
I sat up and rubbed my

grimy face with my dry and horny hands .
My lips and

eyelids were stuck together, and it was only after some
rubbing and with an effort that I was able to Open them .
It was not far
Off the dawn , but there was none of the

bright feel of dawn in the air, which was thick with a hot
murkiness I cannot describe .
The others were still sleep

ing .
Presently it began to grow light enough to read , so

I drew ou t a little pocket copy of the
Ingoldsby Legends

I had brought with me, and read the
Jackdaw of Rheims .

When I got to where

-headed with thirst and

weariness and want of food
for I fell to thinking how as

tonished the cardinal and his nice little boy and the jack

daw would have looked to see a burned

-u p, brown

-eyed,

griz z led~hair ed little elephant

-hunter suddenly bound in

and put his dirty face into the basin and swallow every
drop of the precious water.
The idea amused me so that

I laughed or rather cackled aloud, which woke the others
up, and they began to rub thei r dirty faces and get thei r
gummed

-u p lips and eyelids apart.

AS soon as we were all well awake we fell to discussing

the situation, which was Serious enough .
Not a drop of

water was left.
We turned the water

-bottles upside down

and licked the tops, but it was a failure
they were as dry

as a bone.
Good, who had charge of the bottle of brandy,

got it
ou t and looked at it longingly ; but Sir Henry

promptly took it away from him, for to drink raw Spirit
would only have been to precipitate the end.

If we do not ﬁnd water we shall die,

” he said .

If we can trust to the
old don

’s map there should be

some about,

” I said ; but nobody seemed to derive much

satisfaction from that remark, it was SO evident that no
great faith could be put in the map .
It was now gradual

ly growing light, and as we sat blankly staring at each
other I observed the Hottentot VentvOgel rise and begin
to walk about with his eyes on the ground.

least ﬁfteen thousand feet in height, standing not more
than a dozen miles apart, connected by a precipitous cliff

of rock, and towering up in awful white solemnity straight
into the sky. These mountains standing thus, like the pillars
of a gigantic gateway, are Shaped exactly like a woman

breasts .
Their bases swelled gently up from the plain,

looking, at that distance, perfectly round and smooth
and

on the topof each wasa vast round hillock covered with
snow, exactly corresponding to the nipple
on the female

breast .
The stretch of cliff which connected them

precipitous, and on each Side
of them, as far as the eye

could reach, extended Similar lines

here and there by ﬂat, table

like the world

one at Cape Town
a formation, by

the way, very common in Africa .

To describe the grandeur
of the whole view is beyond

my powers .
There was something so inexpressibly solemn

and overpoweringabout those huge volcanoes— for doubt
less they are extinct volcanoes— that it fairly took
ou r

breath away .
For a while the morning lights played upon

the snow and the brown and swelling masses beneath , and
then, as though to veil the majestic sight from ou r curious
eyes, strange mists and clouds gathered and increased
around them, till presently we could only trace their pure

(1gigantic outline swelling ghostlike through the ﬂeecy

envelope .
Indeed , as we afterwards discovered, they were

normally wrapped in this curious gauzy mist, which doubt
less accounted for
one not having made them out more

clearly before .

Scarcely had the mountains vanished into cloud -clad

privacy before
ou r thirst— literally a burning question

reasserted itself.

It was all very well for Ventvogel to, say he smelled

water, but look which way we would we could see no signs

of it.
So far asthe eye could reach there was nothing but

arid, sweltering sand and karoo scrub .
We walked round

the hillock and gazed about anxiously
on the other Side

,

but it was the same story, not a drop
of water was to be

seen
there was no indication
of a pan, a pool,
or a

Spring .

You are a fool ,

” I said, angrily, to Ventvogel

“ there

is no water.

”

But still he lifted his ugly snub nose and sniﬂ ed.

I smell it, Baas
(master) , he answered

“ it is some

where in the air .

”

“ Yes ,

” I said,

“ no doubt it is in the clouds, and about

two months hence it will fall and wash ou r bones .

”

Sir Henry stroked his yellow beard thoughtfully .

” he suggested .

” said Good ;

“ who ever heard
of water being

Let us go and look,

” I put in, and hopelessly enough

we scrambled up the sandy sides
of the hillock, Umbopa

leading .
Presently he stopped as though he were petriﬁed.

N anz ia manzie
(here is water) , he cried, with a loud

voice .

We rushed up to him, and there, sure enough , in a deep

cup or indentation on the very top of the sand

-koppie, was

an undoubted pool of water.
How it came to be in such

a strange place we did not stop to inquire, n or did we
hesitate at its black and uninviting appearance .
It was

water, or a good imitation of it, and that was enough for
us .
We gave a bound and a rush, and in another second

were all down on

ﬂuid as though it were nectar ﬁt for the gods .
Heavens,

how we did drink ! Then , when we had done drinking,
we tore
Off
ou r clothes and sat down in it, absorbing the

moisture through our parched Skins .
You, my reader,

who have only to turn
on a couple
of taps and summon

“ hot

” and
cold
from an unseen, vasty boiler, can have

little idea of the luxury of that muddy wallow in brack
ish, tepid water.

After a while we arose from it, refreshed indeed, and fell

to
on our biltong, of which we had scarcely been able to

touch a mouthful for twenty

-four hours, and ate
ou r ﬁll .

Then we smoked a pipe, and lay down by the side of that
blessed pool under the overhanging shadow Of the bank
and Slept till mid

-day .

All that day we rested there by the water, thanking our

stars that we had been lucky enough to ﬁnd it, bad as it
was, and not forgetting to render a due Share of gratitude
to the shade
of the long

-departed Da Silvestra, who had

corked it down so accurately on the tail of his Shirt .
The

wonderful thing to us was that it Should have lasted
so

long, and the only way that I can account for it is by the
supposition that it is fed by some spring deep down in the
sand .

Having ﬁlled both ourselves and
ou r water -bottles as

full as possible, in far better Spirits we started
off again

with the moon .
That night we covered nearly ﬁ ve

-and

twenty miles, but, needless to say, found no more water,
though we were lucky enough on the following day to get
a little Shade behind some ant

-heaps .

and looked grander than ever .
At the approach of even

ing we started on again , and, to cut a long story Short, by
daylight next morning found ourselves upon the lowest

l
pesof Sheba

’S left breast, foi which we had been stead

ily steering .
By this time ou r water was again exhausted

and we were suffering severely from thirst, nor indeed
could we see any chance of relieving it till we reached the
snow line , far , far above us .
After resting an hour or two,

driven to it by
ou r torturing thirst, we went on again,

toiling painfully in the burning heat up the lava

‘ Slopes,

for we found that the huge base of the mountain was
composed entirely of lava

-beds belched
ou t in some far

past age .

By eleven o

’clock we were utterly exhausted, and were,

generally Speaking, in a very bad way indeed .
The lava

clinker, over which we had to make ou r way, though com

par ati vely smooth compared with some clinker I have
heard of, such as that
on the island
of Ascension, for in

stance, was yet rough enough to make
ou r feet very sore,

and this, together with ou r other miseries, had pretty well

ﬁnished us .
A few hundred yards above us were some

large lumps of lava, and towards these we made with the
intention of lying down beneath their shade . We reached
them, and to ou r surprise, SO far as we had a capacity for
surprise left in us, on a little plateau or ridge close by we
saw that the lava was covered with a dense green growth .
Evidently soil formed from decomposed lava had rested
there, and in
. due course had become the receptacle of seeds

deposited by birds . But we did not take much further i n

terest in the green growth, for
one cannot live
on grass,

like Nebuchadnezzar.
That requires a special dispensa

tion of Providence and peculiar digestive organs
.
So we

sat down under the rocks and groaned, and I, for one, heart
ily wished that we had never started on this fool

’s errand .

AS we were sitting there I saw Umbopa get up and hobble

Off towards the patch
of green , and a few minutes after

wards, to my great astonishment, I perceived that usually

u ncommonly digniﬁed individual dancing and shouting
like a maniac, and waving something green .
Off we all

scrambled towards him as fast as ou r wearied limbs would
carry u s, hoping that he had found water.

“ What is it, Umbopa, son
of a fool ?

” I shouted in

Zulu .

“ It isfood and water, Macu m az ahn,

” and again he waved

the green thing

Then I saw what he had got .
It wasa melon . We had

hit upon a patch
of wild melons, thousands
of them , and

dead ripe .

“ Melons
I yelled to Good, who was next me ; and in

another second he had his false teeth ﬁxed in one .

I think we ate about si x
each before we had done, and ,

poor fruit as they were, I doubt if I ever thought anything
nicer.

But melons are not very satisfying, and when we had

satisﬁed
ou r thirst with their pulpy substance , and set a

stock to cool by the Simple process of cutting them in two
and setting them end on in the hot
su n to get cold by

evaporation, we began to feel exceedingly hungry. We had
still some biltong left, but
ou r stomachs turned from bil

tong, and, besides, we had to be very Sparing of it, for we
could not say when we should get more food .
Just at

this moment a lucky thing happened .
Looking towards

the desert I saw a ﬂock
of about ten large birds ﬂying

straight towards us .

KIN G SOLOMON

’S MIN E S .
7 5

Skit, Baas, Skit
(shoot , master, shoot) , whispered the

Hottentot, throwing himself on his face, an example which
we all followed .

Then I
saw that the birds were a ﬂock
of pauw (bus

tards) , and that they would pass within ﬁfty yards of my
head .
Taking one of the repeating Winchesters, I waited

till they were nearly over
u s, and then jumped
on to my

feet.
On seeing me the pauw bunched up together, as I

expected they would, and I ﬁred two Shots straight into
the thick Of them
, and , as luck would have it, brought one

down , a ﬁne fellow, that weighed about twenty pounds .
In half an hour we had a ﬁre made of dry melon

-stalks,

and he was toasting over it, and we had such a feed as we
had
not had for a week .
We ate that pauw— nothing

was left of him but his bones and hisbeak— and felt not a
little the better afterwards .

That night we again went
on with the moon, carrying

as many melons
aswe could with us .
AS we got higher

up we found the air get cooler and cooler, which was a
great relief to us, and at dawn, so far as we could judge,
were
not more than about a dozen miles from the snow

line .
Here we found more melons, SO had no longer any

anxiety about water, for we knew that we should soon get
plenty Of snow .
But the ascent had now become very

precipitous, and we made but Slow progress, not more than
a mile an hour .
Also that night we ate our last morsel of

biltong .
AS yet, with the exception of the pauw, we had

seen no li ving thing
on the mountain, nor had we come

across a single Spring or stream of water, which struck us
as very odd, considering all the snow above
u s, which

must

, we thought, melt sometimes .
But as we afterwards

discovered, owing to some cause, which it isquite beyond

‘76
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

my power to explain, all the streams ﬂowed down upon
the north side of the mountains .

We now began to grow very anxious about food .
We

had escaped death by thirst, but it seemed probable that
it was only to die of hunger . The events of the next three
miserable days are best described by copying the entries
made at the time in my note

-book .

21st May — Started
11 A .M ., ﬁnding the atmosphere

quite cold enough to travel by day, carrying some water
melons with us .
Struggled on all day, but saw no more

melons, having, evidently, passed ou t Of their district. Saw
no game Of any sort .
Halted for the night at sundown ,

having had no food for many hours .
Suffered much dur

ing the night from cold .

22d.— Started at sunrise again, feeling very faint and

weak .
Only made ﬁve miles all day ; found some patches

of snow, of which we ate, but nothing else.
Camped at

night under the edge
Of a great plateau .
Cold bitter.

Drank a little brandy each , and huddled ourselves together,
each wrapped up in
ou r blanket to keep ourselvesalive .

Are now suffering frightfully from starvation and weari
ness .
Thought that VentvOgel would have died during

the night .

23 d.— Struggled forward once more as soon as the su n

was well up , and had thawed
ou r limbs a little .
We are

now in a dreadful plight, and I fear that unless we get
food this will be ou r last day

’s journey . But little brandy

left .
Good, Sir Henry, and Umbopa bear up wonderfully,

but VentvOgel is in a very bad way.
Like most Hotten

tots, he cannot stand cold .
Pangs of hunger not so bad,

but have a sort of numb feeling about the stomach .
Oth

e rs say the same .
We are now
on a level with the pre

7 8
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

If we don

’t ﬁnd it before dark we are dead men, that

is all about it,

” was my consolatory reply .

For the next ten minutes we trudged
on in Silence,

when suddenly Umbopa, who was marching along beside

m e,

‘ wrapped up in his blanket and with a leather belt

strapped SO tight round his stomach , to
make his hunger

small,

” as he said, that his waist looked like a girl

’s , caught

me by the arm .

“ Look !

” he said, pointing towards the springing Slope

of the nipple .

I followed his glance, and perceived , some two hundred

yards from us, what appeared to be a hole in the snow.

“ It is the cave,

” said Umbopa .

We made the best
of ou r way to the Spot, and found,

sure enough, that the hole was the mouth
of a cave, no

doubt the same as that of which Da Silvestra wrote .
We

were none too soon, for just as we reached shelter the

su n went down with startling rapidity, leaving the whole
place nearly dark.
In these latitudes there is but little

twilight .
We crept into the cave, which did not appear

to be very big, and, huddling ourselves together
for

warmth , swallowed what remained of ou r brandy— barely
a mouthful each—and tried to forget
ou r miseries in sleep .

But this the cold was too intense to allow us to do .
I am

convinced that at that great altitude the thermometer
cannot have been less than fourteen
or ﬁfteen degrees b e

low freezing

-point .
What this meant to us , enervated as

we were by hardship, want of food, and the great heat Of
the desert, my reader can imagine better than I can de
scribe .
S ufﬁce it to say that it was something as near

death from exposure as I have ever felt .
There we sat

hour after hour through the bitter night, feeling the frost

Wander round and nip
u s now in the ﬁnger, now in the

foot, and now in the face .
In vain did we huddleup closer

and closer ; there was no warmth in our miserable

, starved

carcasses .
Sometimes one
of
u swould drop into an
u n

easy Slumber for a few minutes, but we could not sleep
long, and perhaps it wasfortunate, for I doubt if we should
ever have woke again .
I believe it was only by force of

will that we kept ourselves alive at all .

N ot very long before dawn I heard the Hottentot Vent

vogel , whose teeth had been chattering all night like
eas

tanetS, give a deep Sigh , and then his teeth stopped chat
tering .
I did
not think anything
of it at the time, con

cluding that he had gone to sleep .
His back was resting

against mine, and it seemed to grow colder and colder, till
at last it was like ice .

At length the air began to grow gray with light, then

swift golden arrows came ﬂashing across the snow, and at
last the glorious sun peeped
u p above the lava wall and

looked in u pon ou r half

-frozen forms and upon VentvOgel,

Sitting there am ong us stone dead.
N O wonder his back

had felt cold, poor fellow .
He had died when I heard

him sigh , and was now almost frozen stiff.
Shocked

! b e

yond measure, we
dragged ourselves from the corpse

(strange the horror we all have of the companionship of a

dead body) , and left it still Sitting there, with its arm s
clasped round its knees .

By this time the su nlight was pouring its cold rays (for

here they were cold) straight in at the mouth of the cave .

Su ddenly I heard an exclamation
of fear from some
one,

and turned my head down the cave .

And this was what I saw .
Sitting at the end Of it, for

it was not more than twenty feet long, was another form,

80
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

of which the head rested on the ch est
and the long arms

hung down .
I stared at it,
and saw that it too was a

dead m an, and what wasmore, a white man .

The others saw it, too, and the Sight proved too much

for our shattered nerves .
One and all we scrambled
ou t

of the cave as fast asou r half

~fr oz en limbs would allow.

OUTSIDE the cave we halted, feeling rather foolish .

I am going back,

” said Sir Henry .

Why ?

” asked Good .

Because it has struck me that— what we saw— may be

my brother .

”

This was a new idea, and we ré

-entered the cave to put

it to the proof .
After the bright light outside
ou r eyes,

weak as they were with staring at the snow, could not for
a while pierce the gloom of the cave .
Presently, however,

we grew accustomed to the semi

-darkness, and advanced

on to the dead form .

Sir Henry knelt down and peered into its face .

Thank God,

” he said, with a sigh
of relief,

“ it is not

my brother .

Then I went and looked .
The corpse was that of a tall

man i n middle life, with aquiline features, grizzled hair,
and a long black mustache .
The skin was perfectly yel

low, and stretched tightly over the bones .
Its clothing ,

with the exception
of what seemed to be the remains of a

pair of woollen hose, had been removed, leaving the skele
ton -like frame naked .
Round the neck hung a yellow

ivory cruciﬁx .
The corpse was frozen perfectly stiff.

Who on earth can it be ?” said I .
Can

’t you guess ?

” asked Good .

I Shook my head .

“ Impossible,

And what is there to prevent his lasting for three

asked Good .

“ If only the air is cold enough ﬂesh and

We gazed astonished for a moment, forgetting ou r
own

miseries in the extraordinary and , as it seemed to us,
semi

-miraculous sight .

“ Ay,

” said Sir Henry,
and here is where he got his

ink from,

” and he pointed to a small wound
on the dead

man

’s left arm
Did ever man
see such a thing b e

fore

There was no longer any doubt about the matter, which

I confess, for my own part , perfectly appalled me . There he
sat, the dead man , whose directions, written some ten gen

erati ons ago, had led us to this Spot .
There
In my
own

hand was the rude pen with which he had written them,
and there round his neck was the cruciﬁx his dying lips
had kissed .
Gazing at him my imagination could recon

struct the whole scene : the traveller dying
of cold and

starvation, and yet striving to convey the great secret he

KIN G SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .
83

had discovered to the world ; the awful loneliness
of his

death ,
of which the evidence sat before us .
It even

seemed to me that I could trace in his strongly-marked
features a likeness to those Of my poor friend Silvestre, his
descendant, who had died twenty years ago in my arms,
but p erhaps that was fancy.
At any rate, there he sat, a

sad memento of the fate that so often overtakes those who
would penetrate into the unknown ; and there probably he

will still sit, crowned with the dread majesty of death, for
centuries yet unborn , to startle the eyes of wanderers like
ourselves, if any such Should ever come again to invade
his loneliness .
The thing overpowered us, already nearly

done to death as we were with cold and hunger.

“ Let us go,

” said Sir Henry, in a low voice
stay, we

will give him a companion ,

” and , lifting up the dead body

Of the Hottentot VentvOgel, he placed it near that
of the

old don .
Then he stooped down and with a jerk broke

the rotten string
of the cruciﬁx round his neck, for his

ﬁngers were too cold to attempt to unfasten it .
I believe

that he still has it .
I took the pen, and it is before me

as I write— sometimes I Sign my name with it .

Then , leaving those two, the proud white man of a past

age and the poor Hottentot , to keep their eternal vigil in
the midst
of the eternal snows, we crept
ou t of the cave

into the welcome sunshine and resumed ou r path , wonder
ing in
ou r hearts how many hours it would be before we

were even as they are .

When we had gone about half a mile we came to the

edge
of the plateau , for the nipple
Of the mountain did

not rise
ou t
of its exact centre, though from the desert

side it seemed to do so .
What lay below us we could

not see

morning mist .
Presently, however, the higher layers
of

mist cleared a little, and revealed, some ﬁve hundred yards
beneath us, at the end
of a long Slope of snow, a patch of

green grass , through which a stream was running .
N or

was this all .
By the stream, basking in the morning sun ,

stood and lay a group of from ten to ﬁfteen large antelop es
— at that distance we could not see what they were .

The sight ﬁlled us with an unreasoning joy.
There

was food in plenty if only we could get it .
But the ques

tion was how to get it.
The beasts were fully si x hundred

yards off, a very long shot, and one not to be depended on
when one

’s life hung on the results .

Rapidly we discussed the advisability of trying to stalk

the game, but ﬁnally reluctantly dismissed it .
To begin

with , the wind was not favorable, and further, we should
be certain to be perceived, however careful we were,
against the blinding background of snow which we Should
be obliged to traverse .

“ Well, we must have a try from where we are,
said

Sir Henry .
Which Shall it be, Quatermain, the repeat

ing riﬂes or the expresses ?

”

Here again was a question .
The Winchester repeaters

—of which we had two , Umbopa carrying poor Ventvo
gel

’s as well as his
own
—were Sighted
u p to a thousand

yards, whereas the expresses were only Sighted
to three

hundred and ﬁf ty, beyond which distance shooting with
them was more
or less guess

-work .
On the other hand

,

if they did hit, the express bullets, being expanding

, were

much more likely to bring the game down .
It was a

knotty point, but I made up my mind that we must risk
it and u se the expresses .

“ Let each of us take the buck opposite to him .

the results
Of over -feeding on starving stomachs, we were

careful not to eat too much, stopping while we were still
hungry .

“ Thank God
said Sir Henry ;
that brute has saved

ou r lives .

I rose and went to look at the antelope, for I was
not

certain .
It was about the Size

The animal was

fairly shot high up in the shoulder, though whose bullet
it was that brought it down we could not, of course , dis

cover .
I believe that Good, m indful
Of his marvellous

shot at the giraffe, secretly set it down to his Own prowess,
and we did not contradict him .

We had been so busy satisfying ou r starving stomachs

that we had hitherto not found time to look about us .
But now, having set Umbopa to cut
off as much
of the

best meat as we were likely to be able to carry, we began
to inspect
ou r surroundings .
The mist had now cleared

away, for it was eight O

up, so we were able to take in all the country before us at

try .
Here were dense patches
of lofty forest, there a

great river wound its silvery way.
To the left stretched

a vast expanse
of rich, undulating veldt or grass land, on

which we could just make
ou t countless herds of game or

cattle, at that distance we could not tell which .
This ex

panse appeared to be ringed in by a wall of distant moun
tains .
To the right the country was
m ore
or less moun

tainou s
, that is, solitary hills stood up from its level, with

stretches of cultivated lands between, among which we
could distinctly see groups
of dome shaped huts .
The

landscape lay before us like a map, in which rivers ﬂashed
like silver snakes, and Alplike peaks crowned with wildly
twisted snow

-wreaths rose in solemn grandeur, while over

all was the glad sunlight and the wide breath of Nature

’s

happy life .

Two curious things struck us as we gazed .
First, that

the country before us must lie at least ﬁve thousand feet
higher than the desert we had crossed, and, secondly, that
all the rivers ﬂowed from south to north .
AS we had pain

ful reason to know, there was no water at all on the south
ern Side
of the vast range
on which we stood, but
on the

northern Side were many streams, most of which appeared
to unite with the great river we could trace winding away
farther than we could follow it .

We sat down for a while and gazed in Silence at this

wonderful view .
Presently Sir Henry spoke .

Great Road ?

” he said .

I nodded, my eyes still looking ou t over the far country.

Well, look
there it is !

” and he pointed a little to ou r

right.

Good and I looked accordingly, and there, winding away

towards the plain, was what appeared to be a wide turn
pike road.
We had not seen it at ﬁrst because it, on reach

ing the plain, turned behind some broken country .
We

did not say anything, at least not much
we were begin

ning to lose the sense
of wonder .
Somehow it did not

seem particularly unnatural that we should ﬁnd a sort
of

Roman road in this strange land .
We accepted the fact,

that was all .

Well,

” said Good,

“ it must be quite near us if we cut

off to the right .
Hadn

’t we better be making a start ?

”

This was sound advice, and so soon as we had washed

ou r faces and hands in the stream we acted
on it .
For

a mile
or SO we made our way over boulders
and
“ across

patches of snow, till suddenly, on reaching the top of the
little rise, there lay the road at ou r feet .
It was a splendid

road cut ou t of the solid rock, at least ﬁfty feet wide, and
apparently well kept
but the odd thing about it was that

it seemed to begin there .
We walked down and stood on

it, but one Single hundred paces behind u s, In the direction

of Sheba

’s breasts, it vanished , the whole surface
of the

mountain being strewed with boulders interspersed with
patches of snow.

“ What do you make of that, Quatermain
asked Sir

Henry .

I shook my head, I could m ake nothing of it.

I have it 1

” said Good ;

“ the road no doubt ran right

over the range and across the desert the other Side

, but

the sand of the desert has covered it up , and above us it
has been obliterated by some volcanic eruption Of molten
lava.

”

This seemed a good suggestion
at any rate , we accepted

it, and proceeded down the mountain .
It was a very dif

isn

’t Egyptian handiwork, all I have to
say is it is very

”

By midday we had advanced sufﬁciently far down the

mountain to reach the region where wood was to be met

with .
First we came to scattered bushes which grew more

and more frequent, till at last we found the road winding
through a vast grove of Silver

-trees similar to those which

are to be seen
on the Slopes of Table Mountain at Cape

Town .
I had never before met with them in all my wan

deri ngs, except at the Cape, and their appearance here as

tonished me greatly .

“ Ah
said Good, surveying these Shining

-leaved trees

with evident enthusiasm,

“ here is lots of wood, let us stop

and cook some dinner ; I have about digested that
r aw

meat .

”

Nobody objected to this, so, leaving the road, we made

ou r way to a stream which was babbling away not far off,
and soon had a goodly ﬁre of dry boughs blazing .
Cutting

off some substantial hunks from the ﬂesh of the inoo which
we had brought with us, we proceeded to toast them on
the ends
of Sharp sticks, as one sees the K afﬁ rsdo, and ate

them with relish .
After ﬁlling ourselves , we lit ou r pipes

and gave ourselves up to enjoyment, which, compared to
the hardships we had recently undergone, seemed almost
heavenly .

The brook, of which the banks were clothed with dense

masses of a gigantic Species of maidenhair fern interspersed

with feathery tufts
of wild asparagu s , babbled away mer

rily at
ou r Side, the soft air murmured through the leaves

of the Silver

-trees, doves cooed around, and bright -winged

birds ﬂashed like living gems from bough to bough .
It

waslike Paradise .

The magic
of the place, combined with the overwhelm

ing sense of dangers left behind and of the promised land
reached at last, seemed to charm u sinto Silence .
Sir Henry

and Umbopa sat conversing in a mixture of broken Eng
lish and Kitchen Zulu in a low voice, but earnestly enough

,

and I lay, with my eyes half shut, upon that fragrant bed

of fern and watched them .
Presently I missed Good, and

looked to see what had become
of him .
AS I did so I ob

served him sitting by the bank of the stream, in which he
had been bathing .
He had nothing
on but his ﬂannel

shirt, and , his natural habits
of extreme neatness having

reasserted themselves , was actively employed in making a
most elaborate toilet .
He had washed his gutta -percha

collar, thoroughly shaken ou t his trousers, coat, and waist
coat, and was now folding them up neatly till he was
ready to put them
on, Shaking his head sadly as he did SO

over the numerous rents and tears in them which had nat

u r ally resulted from ou r frightful journey .
Then he took

his boots, scrubbed them with a handful of fern , and ﬁnally
rubbed them over with a piece of fat which he had care
fully saved from the i nco meat, till they looked, compara

ti vely Speaking, respectable .
Having inspected them j u

di ci ou sly through his eyeglass, he put theyn on and began
a fresh Operation .
From a little bag he carried he pro

du ced a pocket -com b in which wasﬁxed a tiny looking
glass, and in this surveyed himself.
Apparently he was

not satisﬁed, for he proceeded to do his hair with great
care .
Then came a pause while he again contemplated

the effect
still it was not satisfactory .
He felt his chin ,

on which was now the
accumulated scrub
of a ten days

’

beard .
Surely,

” thought I ,

“ he isnot going to try and

shave .
But SO it was .
Taking the piece
of fat with

9 2
KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .

which he had greased his boots, he washed it carefully in
the stream
.
Then diving again into the bag, he brought

ou t a little pocket razor with a guard to it, such as are
sold to people afraid
of cutting themselves , or to those

about to
u ndertake a
sea voyage .
Then he vigorously

scrubbed his face and chin with the fat and began .
B ut

it was evidently a painful process, for he groaned very
much over it, and I was convulsed with inward laughter
as I watched him struggling with that stubbly beard .
It

seemed so very Odd that a man Should take the trouble to
Shave himself with a piece of fat in such a place and under

such circumstances .
At last he succeeded in getting the

worst of the scrub
off the right Side
of his face and chin,

when suddenly I, who waswatching, became aware
of a

ﬂash of light that passed just by his head .

Good Sprang up with a profane exclamation (if it had

n ot been a safety razor he would certainly have cut his
throat) , and
so did I, without the exclamation , and this

was what I saw.
Standing there, not more than twenty

paces from where I was, and ten from Good, was a group

of men .
They were very tall and copper - colored, and

some
of them wore great plumes
of black feathers and

Short cloaks of leopard skins
this was all I noticed at the

moment .
In front of them stood a youth
of about seven

teen, his hand still raised and his body bent forward in
the attitude of a Grecian statue of a spear -thrower.
Evi

dently the ﬂash
of light had been a weapon, and he had

thrown it .

As I looked an Old, soldier

-like looking man stepped

forward ou t of the group, and catching the youth by the
arm said something to him . Then they advanced upon us .

Sir Henry, Good, and Umbopa had by this time seized

I was Slightly staggered at this, more especially as I saw

the hands of some of the party of men steal down to their
Sides, where hung on each what looked to me like a large

What does that beggar say ?

” asked Good .

He says we are going to be scragged,

” I answered,

grimly .

Oh, Lord,

” groaned Good ; and, as was his way when

perplexed, put hishand to his false teeth , dragging the top
set down and allowing them to ﬂy back to his j aw with a
snap .
It was a most fortunate move, for next second the

digniﬁed crowd of K u ku anasgave a simultaneous yell
Of

horror, and bolted back some yards .

“ What

moved them .
Take them ou t, Good, take them
o ut

He obeyed, slipping the set into the Sleeve of his ﬂannel

Shirt .

In another second curiosity had overcome fear, and the

men advanced Slowly.
Apparently they had now forgot

ten their amiable intentions
of doing for us .

How is it, O strangers,

” asked the Old man , solemnly,

“ that the teeth
of the man

nothing
on but a ﬂannel shirt, and had only half ﬁnished

his Shaving)

“ whose body is clothed, and whose legs are

bare, who grows hair on one Side of his sickly face and not
on the other, and who has one shining and transparent eye ,
move of themselves, coming away from the jaws and

turning Of their own will

Open your mouth,

to Good , who promptly

curled up hislips and grinned at the oldgentleman like an

Of gum as utterly innocent

HS audience gasped .

“ Where are his teeth ?

” they shouted ;
with our eyes

we saw them .

”

Turning his head Slowly and with a gesture of ineffable

contempt, Good swept his hand across his mouth .
Then

he grinned again, and lo !there were two rows of lovely
teeth .

The young man who had ﬂ ung the knife threw himself

down
on the grass and gave vent to a prolonged howl of

terror ; and as for the Old gentleman, his knees knocked to
gether with fear .

“ I
see that ye are Spirits,

” he said, falteringly ;

“ did

ever man born of woman have hair on
one Side of his face

and not
on the other, or a round and transparent eye, or

teeth which moved and melted away and grew again ?
Pardon

Here was l uck indeed, and, needless to say, I jumped at

the chance .

“ It is granted,

Nay,

benignly as I uttered that amazing lie .

” I continued ,
ye might think that after

SO long a journey we should ﬁnd it in our hearts to avenge
such a reception , mayhap to strike cold in death the i m
pious hand that— that, in Short— threw a knife at the head

of him whose teeth come and go .

”

Spare him , my lords,

” said the
Old man, in supplica

“ he is the king

’s son, and I am his uncle .
If any

thing befalls him his blood will be required at my hands .

”

“ Yes, that is certainly so ,

” put in the young man with

great emphasis .

You may perhaps doubt ou r power to avenge,

of this by

Stay, I will Show you .

Here, you dog and Slave

a wink towards my express riﬂe .

Umbopa rose to the occasion, and with something as

nearly resembling a grin as I have ever seen on his digui

ﬁ ed face, handed me the riﬂe .

It is here, O lord of lords,
he said, with a deep

Obeisance .

Now, just before I asked for the riﬂe I had perceived a

little klipspringer antelope standing
on a mass Of rock

about seventy yards away, and determined to risk a Shot
at it .

“ Ye see that buck ,

the party before me .
Tell me, is it possible for

and I turned round suddenly to address Good, who was
tramping along sullenly behind, his mind fully occupied

greatest interest to my conversation with I nfadoos

’

I nodded easily, though I was not quite easy in my mind .
About half a mile from the gates of the kraal wasa long

stretch
Of rising ground Sloping gently upward from the

road, and
on this the companies formed.
It wasa splen

did sight to see them , each company about three hundred
strong, charging swiftly up the Slope, with ﬂashing Spears
and waving plumes, and taking their appointed place .
By

the time we came to the Slope twelve such companies, or
in all three thousand si x hundred men , had passed ou t and
taken up their positions along the road .

Presently we came to the ﬁrst company, and were able

to gaze in astonishment
on the most magniﬁcent
set Of

men I have ever seen .
They were all men of mature age,

mostly veterans Of about forty, and
not
one
of them was

under si x
feet in height, while many were si x feet three

or four .
They wore upon their heads heavy black plumes

of Sacab oola feathers, like those which adorned our guides .
Round their waists and also beneath the right knee were
bound circlets Of white
ox

-tails , and in their left hands

were round shields about twenty inches across .
These

shields were very curious .
The framework consisted
of

an iron plate beaten
o ut thin, over which was stretched

milk

-white
c x

-hide .
The weapons that each man bore

were Simple, but most effective, consisting of a Short and
very heavy two

-edged spear with a
wooden Shaft, the

blade being about
six inches across at the widest part .

These Spears were not used for throwing, but, like the
Zulu

“ bangwan,

”
or
stabbing assegai, were for
close

quarters only, when the
wound inﬂicted by them was

terrible .
In addition to these b angwans each man also

carried three large and heavy knives, each knife weighing
about two pounds .
One knife was ﬁxed in the
ox

-tail

girdle , and the other two at the back of the round shield .
These knives, which are called
tollas
by the Kuku anas
,

take the place
of the throwing assegai of the Zulus .
A

Ku ku ana warrior
can throw them with great accuracy at

a distance
of ﬁfty yards, and it i stheir custom on charg

ing to hurl a volley of them at the enemy asthey come to
close quarters .

Each company stood like a collection
of bronze statues

till we were opposite to it, when , at a signal given by its
commanding Ofﬁcer, who, distinguished by a leopard

-skin

cloak, stood some paces in front , every spear was raised
into the air, and from three hundred throats sprang forth
with a sudden roar the royal salute
Of

Then ,

when we
had passed, the company formed behind us

and followed us towards the kraal , till at last the whole
regiment
of the

“ Grays

” (so called from their white

Shields) , the crack corps
of the
Ku ku ana people, was

marching behind us with a tread that shook the ground .

At length , branching
off from Solomon

’s Great Road,

we came to the wide fosse surrounding the kraal, which

was at least a mile round and fenced with a strong pali
sade Of piles formed Of the trunks of trees .
At the gate

way this fosse was spanned by a primitive drawbridge
which was let down by the guard to allow us to pass in .

The kraal was exceedingly well laid
ou t.
Through the

centre
r an a wide pathway intersected at right angles by

other pathways so arranged as to cut the huts into square

blocks

, each block being the quarters
of a company .
The

huts were dome

-Shaped, and built, like those of the Zulus,

of a framework of wattle beautifully thatched with grass

but, unlike the Zulu huts, they had doorways through
which
one could walk .
Also they were much larger, and

surrounded with a veranda about Six feet wide, beautiful

ly paved with powdered lime trodden hard.
All along

each side of the wide pathway that pierced the kraal were
ranged hundreds Of women, brought out by curiosity to
look at us .
These women are , for a native race, exceed

i ngly handsome .
They are tall and graceful, and their

ﬁgures are wonderfully ﬁne .
The hair, though Short, is

rather curly than woolly, the features are frequently
aquiline, and the lips are not unpleasantly thick, as is the
case in most African races .
But what struck us most

was their exceeding quiet, digniﬁed air.
They were as

well

-bred i n their way
as the habi tu és of a fashionable

drawing

-room, and in this respect differ from Zulu women ,

andtheir cousins, the Masai, who inhabit the district b e

Their curiosity had brought them

see us, but they allowed no rude expression of wonder or
savage criticism to pass their lips

Not even when
old Infadoos with a

allow the feeling

mastered their minds to ﬁnd expression .

ceedingly white) , and that was all .
But this was quite

enough for Good, who is modest by nature .

When we got to the centre of the kraal I nfadooshalted

at the door Of a large b u t, which was surrounded at a dis
tance by a circle of smaller ones .

“ Enter, sons
of the stars,

voice,

together with the rest of the party, been overawed by ou r
white appearance and by
ou r magic properties ; but it

seemed to me that on discovering that we ate , drank, and
Slept like other mortals , his awe was beginning to wear off
and be replaced by a sullen suspicion, which made us feel
rather uncomfortable .

In the course
of our meal Sir Henry suggested to me

that it might be well to try and discover if our hosts knew
anything of his brother

’s fate, or if they had ever seen or

heard of him
but, on the whole, I thought that it would

be wiser to say nothing of the matter at that time .

After supper we ﬁlled
ou r pipes and lit them ; a pro

ceedingwhich ﬁlled Infadoosand Scragga with astonish
ment .
The K u ku anaswere evidently unacquainted with

the divine uses
of tobacco

-smoke .
The herb was grown

among them extensively ; but, like the Zulus, they only
used it for snuff, and quite failed to identify it in its new
form .

Presently I asked Infadoos when we were to proceed

on our journey, and was delighted to learn that prepara
tions had been made for
u S to leave
on the following

morning, messengers having already left to inform Twala,
the king, of our coming .
It appeared that Twala was at

his principal place, known as Loo , making ready for the
great annual feast which was held in the ﬁrst week
of

June .
At this gathering all the regiments, with the ex

cepti on
of certain detachments left behind for garrison

purposes, were brought up and paraded before the king,
and the great annual witch

-hunt, of which more by and

by, was held.

We were to start at dawn ; and I nfadoos, who was to

accompany us, expected that we Should, unless we were

KING SOLOMON

’S MIN ES .
111

detained by accident or by swollen rivers, reach Loo
on

the night of the second day .

When they had given us this information
ou r visitors

bade us good

-night
and, having arranged to watch turn

and turn about, three of us ﬂung ourselves down and Slept
the sweet Sleep
of the weary, while the fourth sat up
on

the lookout for possible treachery.

CHAPTER IX .

T W A L A, T H E K I N G.

IT will not be necessary for me to detail at length the

incidents of
ou r journey to Loo .
It took two good days

’

travelling along Solomon

’s Great Road, which pursued its

even course right into the heart of K u ku analand.
Sufﬁce

it to say that as we went the country seemed to grow richer
and richer, and the kraals, with their wide surrounding belts
of cultivation , more and more numerous .
They were all

built upon the same principles as the ﬁrst
one we had

reached, and were guarded by ample garrisons of troops .
Indeed, i n K uku analand, as among the Germans, the Zulus,
and the Masai, every able

-bodied man is a soldier, so that

the whole force of the nation i savailable for its wars , Of
fensive or defensive .
Aswe travelled along we were over

taken by thousands of warriors hurrying up to Loo to be
present at the great annual review and festival,
and a

grander series of troops I never sai

r
At sunset on the

second day we stepped to rest awhile upon the summit of
some heights over which the road ran, and there, on a
beautiful and fertile plain before us, was Loo itself .
For

a native town it was an enormous place , quite ﬁve miles
round, I should say, with outlying kraals jutting out from
it, which served on grand occasions as cantonments for
the regiments, and a curious horseshoe

-shaped hill , with

which we were destined to become better acquainted, about

two miles to the north .
It was beautifully situated, and

114
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

pointed out the mountains .
There are Solomon

’s dia

mond mines,

” I said .

Umbopa was standing with them, apparently plunged

in
one
of the ﬁts of abstraction which were common to

him, and caught my words .

“ Yes, Macu m az ahn,

” he put in, in Zulu,

“ the diamonds

are surely there, and you shall have them , since you white
men are so fond of toys and money .

”

How dost thou know that, Umbopa
I asked, sharply,

for I did not like his mysterious ways.

He laughed ;

“ I dreamed it in the night, white
m en,

and then he too turned upon his heel and went .

Now what,

” said Sir Henry,
is
ou r black fr iend at ?

He knows more than he chooses to say, that is clear .
By

the way, Quatermain, has he heard anything
Of —
of my

brother

“ Nothing ; he has asked every one he has got friendly

with , but they all declare no white man has ever been seen
in the country before .

”

“ D O you suppose he ever got here at all ?

” suggested

Good ;
we have only reached the place by a miracle ; is

it likely he could have reached it at all without the map ?

”

“ I don

’t know,
said Sir Henry, gloomily,

“ but some

how I think that I shall ﬁnd him .

”

Slowly the sun sank, and then suddenly darkness rushed

down on the land like a tangible thing.
There was no

breathing

-place between the day and the night, no soft

transformation scene, for in these latitudes twilight does
not exist.
The change from day to night is as quick and

as absolute as the change from life to death .
The sun

sank and the world was wreathed in shadows .
But not

for long, for see, in the east there is a glow, then a bent

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
115

edge
of silver light, and at last the full how
of the cres

cent moon peeps above the plain and shoots its gleaming
arrows far and wide , ﬁlling the earth with a faint
r efu l

gence, as the glow of a good man

’s deeds shines for a while

upon his little world after his
su n has
set, lighting the

faint

-hearted travellers who follow
on towards a fuller

dawn .

We stood and watched the lovely sight, while the stars

grew pale before this chastened majesty, and felt
ou r

hearts lifted up in the presence of a beauty we could not
realize , much less describe .
Mine has been a rough life,

my reader, but there are a few things I am thankful to
have lived for , and one of them is to have seen that moon
rise over Ku ku analand.
Presently our meditations were

broken
I n upon by ou r polite friend Infadoos
.

If my lords are ready we will journey on to Loo, where

a b u t is made ready for my lords to

-night .
The moon is

now bright, so that we shall not fall On the way .

”

We assented, and in an hour

’s time were at the outskirts

of the town,
of which the extent, mapped out as it was

by thousands
of camp

-ﬁres, appeared absolutely endless .

Indeed, Good , who was always fond of a bad joke, christ

ened it

“ Unlimited Loo .

”
Presently we came to a moat

with a drawbridge, where we were met by the rattling of
arms and the hoarse challenge of a sentry.
Infadoosgave

some password that I could not catch , which was met with
a salute, and we passed
on through the central street
of

the great grass city .
After nearly half an hour

’s tramp

past endless lines
of huts, Infadoos at last halted at the

gate
of a little group
of huts which surrounded a small

courtyard
of powdered limestone, and informed us that

these were to be
ou r
poor

” quarters .

116
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

We entered, and found that a b u t had been assigned to

each of us .
These huts were superior to any which we

had yet seen , and in each was a most comfortable bed
made of tanned skins spread upon mattresses of aromatic
grass .
Food , too, was ready for us, and as soon as we had

washed ourselves with water ,which stood ready in earthen
ware jars , some young women of handsome appearance
brought us roasted meat and mealie cobs daintily served
on wooden platters, and presented it to us with deep chei

sau ces
.

We ate and drank, and then, the beds having by ou r r e

quest been all moved into one hut, a precaution at which
the amiable young ladies smiled, we ﬂung ourselves down
to sleep, thoroughly wearied ou t with our long journey .

When we woke, it was to ﬁnd that the su n was high in

the heavens, and that the female attendants, who did not
seem to be troubled by any false Shame, were already
standing inside the hut, having been ordered to attend and
help us to

“ make ready .

”

“ Make ready, indeed,

” growled Good ;

“ when
one has

only a ﬂannel shirt and a pair of boots, that does not take
long.
I wish you would ask them for my trousers .

”

I asked accordingly, but was informed that those sacred

relics had already been taken to the king , who would see
us in the forenoon .

Having, somewhat to their astonishment and disappoint

ment, requested the young ladies to step outside, we pro

ceeded to make the best toilet that the circumstances
admitted of. Good even went the length of again shaving
the right side of his face ; the left, on which now appeared
a very fair crop
of whiskers, we impressed upon him he

must
on no account touch .
As
for ourselves, we were

118
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

the habitations Of the king

’s wives .
Exactly Opposite the

gateway, on the farther side of the Open space, wasa very
large hut, which stood by itself, in which his majesty
r e

sided .
All the rest was open ground ; that is
to
say, it

would have been Open had it not been ﬁlled by company
after company
of warriors, who were mustered there to

the number of seven or eight thousand . These men stood
still as statues as we advanced through them, and it wou ld
be impossible to give an idea of the grandeur of the spec
tacle which they presented, in their waving plumes, their
glancing spears, and iron

-backed
ox

-hide shields .

The Space in front of the large b u t was empty, but b e

fore it were placed several stools .
On three of these, at a

Sign from Infadoos, we seated ourselves, Umbopa standing
behind us .
AS for Infadoos, he took up a position by the

door of the hut.
So we waited for ten minutes or more in

the midst of a dead silence , but conscious that we were the
Object
of the concentrated gaze of some eight thousand

pairs
of eyes .
It was a somewhat trying ordeal, but we

carried it off as best we could .
At length the door of the

hut opened, and a gigantic ﬁgure, with a splendid tiger
skin kar r ossﬂung over i tsshoulders, stepped ou t, followed
by the boy Scragga, and what

'
appear ed to us to be a with

ered

-u p monkey wrapped in a fur cloak .
The ﬁgure seated

itself upon a stool , Scragga took his stand behind it, and
the withered

- u p m onkey crept
on all fours into the shade

Of the hut and squatted down .

Still there was silence .
Then the gigantic ﬁgure slipped off the karr ossand stood

u p before us, a truly alarming spectacle .
It was that of an

enormou s man with the most entirely repulsive countenance
we had ever beheld .
The lips were asthick as a negro

’s,

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
119

the nose was ﬂat, it had but one gleaming black eye (for
the other was represented by a hollow in the face) , and its
whole expression was cruel and sensual to a degree . From
the large head rose a magniﬁcent plume
of white ostrich

feathers, the body was clad in a shirt
of shining chain

armor, while round the waist and right knee was the usual
garnish
of white
ox
-tails .
In the right hand was a huge

spear.
Round the neck was a thick torque
of gold, and

bound on to the forehead was a single and enormous uncut
diamond .

Still there was silence ; but not for long .
Presently the

ﬁgure, whom we rightly guessed to be the king, raised the
great spear in his hand .
Instantly eight thousand spears

were raised in answer, and from eight thousand throats
rang out the royal sal ute of
K oom
Three times this

was repeated , and each time the earth shook with the noise,
that can only be compared to the deepest notes of thunder .

“ Be humble, O people,

” piped out a thin voice which

seemed to come from the monkey in the shade ;

“ it is the

king .

”

“ I t i sthe ki ng,

” boomed ou t eight thousand throats, in

answer.
B e hu m ble, 0 p eop le;
i t i sthe Ici ng

.

”

Then there was silence again— dead silence.
Presently,

however, it was broken .
A soldier
on
ou r left dropped

his shield, which fell with a clatter on the limestone ﬂoor
ing.

Twala turned his
one cold eye in the direction
of the

noise .

Come hither, thou,

” he said, in a voice of thunder.

A ﬁne young man stepped out of the ranks, and stood

before him .

“ It was thy shield that fell, thou awkward dog.
Wilt

120
KING
SoLOMON

’s MINES .

thou make me a reproach in the eyes of strangers from the
stars
What hast thou to say ?

”

And then we saw the poor fellow turn pale under his

dusky skin .

“ It was by chance, 0 calf of the black cow,

” he mur

mured.

“ Then it is a chance for which thou must pay.
Thou

hast made me foolish ; prepare for death .

”

“ I am the king

’s ox,
was the low answer .

Scragga,

” roared the king,

“ let me see how thou canst

use thy spear.
Kill me this awkward dog .

Scragga stepped forward with an ill

-favored grin, and

lifted his spear.
The poor victim covered his eyes with

his hand and stood still .
Asfor us, we were petriﬁed with

horror.

Once, twice,

” he waved the spear and then struck, ah ,

God !right home— the spear stood out a foot behind the
soldier

’s back.
He ﬂung up his hands and dropped dead .

From the multitude around rose something like a murmur,
it rolled round and round, and died away .
The tragedy

was ﬁnished ; there lay the corpse , and we had not yet real

iz ed that it had been enacted .
Sir Henry sprang up and

swore a great oath , then, overpowered by the sense
of

silence, sat down again .

The thrust was a good one,
said the king ;
take him

away .

Four men stepped out of the ranks , and, lifting the body

of the murdered man, carried it away .

Cover up the blood

-stains, cover them up ,
piped ou t

the thin voice from the monkey

-like ﬁgure ;

“ the king

’s

word is spoken, the king

’s doom is done .

”

Thereupon a girl came forward from behind the hut,

’S MINES .

thee .
What, have not these,
pointing to I nfadoos and

Scragga (who, young villain that he was, was employed
in cleaning the blood
of the soldier
oﬁ his spear) ,

“ told

thee what manner of men we are ?
Hast thou ever seen

the like of us ?

” and I pointed to Good , feeling quite sure

that he had never seen anybody before who looked i n the
least like hi m as he then appeared .

“ It is true, I have not,

” said the king .

Have they not told thee how we strike with death

from afar ?

” I went
on.

“ They have told me, but I believe them not .
Let me

see you kill .
Kill me a man among those who stand yon

der
—and he pointed to the Opposite side
of the kraal

and I will believe .”

“ Nay,

” I answered ;
we shed no blood of man except

in just punishment ; but if thou wilt see, bid thy servants
drive in an ox through the kraal gates, and before he has
run twenty paces I will strike him dead .”

“ Nay,

” laughed the king,

“ kill me a man, and I will

believe .

”

Good, 0 king, so be it,

” I answered, coolly ;
do thou

walk across the open space, and before thy feet reach the
gate thou shalt be dead ; or, if thou wilt not, send thy son
Scragga

” (whom at that moment it would have given me

much pleasure to shoot) .

On hearing this suggestion Scragga gave a sort Of howl,

and bolted into the hut .

Twala frowned majestically ;
the suggestion did not

please him .

“ Let a young
ox be driven in,

” he said.

Two men at once departed, running swiftly.

N ow, Sir Henry,

” said I,
do you shoot.
I want to

KING
SOLOMON

’S MINES .
123

show this ruﬂi an that I am not the only magician of the
party .

”

Sir Henry accordingly took the

“ express,
and made

ready .

“ I hope I shall make a good shot,

” he groaned .

Y ou must,

” I answered .
If you miss with the ﬁrst

barrel , let him have the second .
Sight for
one hundred

and ﬁfty yards , and wait till the beast turns broadside

on .

Then came a pause, till presently we caught sight of an

ox running straight for the kraal gate . It came on through
the gate, and then, catching sight of the vast concourse of
people, stopped stupidly, turned round, and bellowed.

Now

’syour time,

” I whispered .

Up went the riﬂe .
Bang !thud !and the
ox was kicking
on his back , shot

in the ribs .
The semi

-hollow bullet had done its work

well, and a sigh
of astonishment went up from the assem

bled thousands .

I turned coolly round

Have I lied, 0 king ?

”

Nay, white man, it is a truth,

” was the somewhat

awed answer.

“ Listen, Twala,

” I went
on
Thou hast seen .
Now

know we come in peace, not in war. See here
(and I held

up the Winchester repeater) ;
here is a hollow staff that

shall enable you to kill even as we kill, only this charm I
lay upon it, thou shalt kill no man with it .
If thou liftest

it against a man , it shall kill thee . Stay, I will show thee .
Bid a man step forty paces and place the shaft Of a spear

i n the ground so that the ﬂat blade looks towards us .”

In a few seconds it was done .

124
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES.

Now, see, I will break the spear .

Taking a careful sight, I ﬁred. The bullet struck the ﬂat

of the spear and broke the blade into fragments .

Again the Sigh of astonishment went up .

Now, Twala ” (handing him the riﬂe) ,

“ this magic

tube we give to thee, and by and byI will Show thee how
to use it ; but beware how thou usest the magic of the stars
against a man of earth,

” and I handed him the riﬂe .
He

took it very gingerly, and laid it down at his feet.
As he

did so I Observed the wizened, monkey -like ﬁgure creeping
up from the shadow of the hut. It crept on all fours, but
when it reached the place where the king sat it rose upon
its feet, and , throwing the furry covering
off its face,
r e

vealed a most extraordinary and weird countenance .
It

was (apparently) that of a woman of great age, so shrunken
that in Size it was no larger than that of a year

-old child,

and was made up
of a collection of deep , yellow wrinkles .

Set in the wrinkles was a sunken slit that represented the
mouth , beneath which the chin curved outward to a point .
There was no nose to Speak
of ; indeed , the whole coun

tenance might have been taken for that
of a
su n -dried

corpse had it not been for a pair of large black eyes , still
full
of ﬁre and intelligence , which gleamed and played

under the snow

- white eyebrows and the projecting parch

m ent

-colored skull, like jewels in a charnel

-house .
AS for

the skull itself, it was perfectly bare, and yellow i n hue,
while its wrinkled scalp moved and contracted like the
hood of a cobra .

The ﬁgure to whom this fearful countenance, which

caused a shiver of fear to pass through
u saswe gazed ou

'

it, belonged stoodstill for a moment, and then suddenly
~

projected a skinny claw armed with nails nearly an inch

Then she turned her bald, vulture head towards us .

What seek ye, white men of the stars ? Ah , yes, of the

Ye shall
not ﬁnd him

He is not here .
Never for ages upon ages has a

shall ye return whence ye came, or shall ye stop with me

Here the features
of this extraordinary creature became

convulsed, and she fell to the ground foaming in
an epi

lepti c ﬁt and was carried off into the hut.

The king rose up trembling, and waved his hand.
In

stantly the regiments began to ﬁle Off, and in ten minutes,
save for ourselves, the king, and a few attendants, the great

space was left clear.

“ it passes in my mind to kill

I laughed .

“ Be careful , O king, we are not easy to

Thou hast seen the fate of the ox ; wouldst thou be

The king frowned .
It is not well to threaten a king.

We threaten not, we speak what is true .
Try to kill

The great man put his hand to his forehead .

Go in peace,

” he said, at length .

“ To

Ye shall see it .
Fear
not that I shall set a

“ It is well, O king,

and

then , accompanied by Infadoos, we rose and went back to

ON reaching our hut, I motioned to I nfadoos to enter

with

Now, Infadoos,

” I said

“ we wo uld speak with thee .

Let my lords say on .
It seems to us, Infadoos, that Twala , the king, is a

”

“ It is so, my lords .
Alas

will smell that man

Many will die before the moon grows pale to n ight .
It

is ever so .
Perhaps I too Shall be killed.
AS yet I have

been spared , because I am Skilled in war and beloved by
the Soldiers ; but I know not how long I shall live
The

land groans at the cruelties
Of Twala, the king ; it is

wearied of hi m and his red ways .

“ Then why is it, Infadoos, that the people do not cast

him down

“ Nay, my lords, he is the king , and if he were killed

isblacker than the heart of Twala, his father.

For many years he lived there working as a servant

and a soldier, but holding in his heart all that his mother
had told hi m
of his
own place, and casting about in his

mind to ﬁnd how he might get back there to see his own
people and his father

’s house before he died .
For many

years he lived and waited, and at last the time came , as it
ever comes to him who can wait for it, and he m et som e
white men who would seek this unknown land, and joined
himself to them .
The white men started and journeyed

on and
on, seeking for one who is lost.
They crossed the

burning desert, they crossed the snow

-clad mountains, and

reached the land of the Kuku anas, and there they met
thee, oh Infadoos
.

”

Surely thou art mad to talk thus,
said the astonished

old soldier.

Thou thinkest so ; see, I will show thee, O my uncle .

I
am
Ign osi , r ightfu l ki ng of the K u ku anas

Then, with a single
movement, he
slipped
Off
the

moocha,

”
or girdle round his middle, and stood naked

before us .

Look,

” he said ;
what is this ?

” and he pointed to the

mark of a great snake tattooed in blue round his middle,
its tail disappearing in its open mouth just above where
the thighs are set into the body.

Infadooslooked, his eyes starting nearly out of his head,

and then fell upon his knees .

K oom ! K oom !

” he ejaculated ;

“ it is my brother’s

son ; it is the king.

”

“ Did I not tell thee so, my uncle
Rise ; I am not yet

the king, but with thy help , and with the help of these
brave white men, who are my friends, I shall be.
But the

oldwoman Gagool was right ; the land shall run with blood

ﬁrst, and hers shall run with it, for
she killed my father

with her words, and drove my mother forth .
And now,

Infadoos, choose thou .
Wilt thou put thy hands between

my hands and be my man
Wilt thou share the dangers

that lie before me, and help me to overthrow this tyrant
and murderer, or wilt thou not ?
Choose thou ?

”

The
old man put his hand to his head and thought .

Then he rose, and, ad vancing to where Umbopa, or rather

Ignosi , stood, knelt before him and took his hand .

Ignosi , rightful king of the K u ku anas, I put my hand

between thy hands, and am thy man till death .
When

thou wast a babe I dandled thee upon my knee ; now shall
my
old arm strike for thee and freedom .

”

“ It is well, Infadoos; if I conquer, thou shalt be the

greatest man in the kingdom after the king .
If I fail , thou

canst only die, and death is not far off for thee .
Rise, my

uncle .

And ye, white men, will ye help me
What have I to

offer ye
The white stones, if I conquer and you can ﬁnd

them, ye shall have as many as ye can carry hence . Will

I translated this remark .

Tell him,
answered Sir Henry,
that he mistakes an

Englishman .
Wealth is good, and if it comes in ou r way

we will take it ; but a gentleman does not sell himself for
wealth .
But, speaking for myself, I
say this : I have

always liked Umbopa, and so far as in me lies will stand
by him in this business .
It will be very pleasant to me

to try and square matters with that cruel devil, Twala .
What do you say, Good, and you , Quatermain

Well,

” said Good,

I translated these answers .

It is well, my friends,

” said
Ignosi, late Umbopa ;

and what say you , Macu m az ahn ; art thou too with me,

old hunter, cleverer than a wounded buffalo ?

”

I thought awhile and scratched my head .

Umbopa, or Ignosi ,

” I said,
I don

’t like revolutions .

I am a man
of peace, and a bit of a coward

” (here Um

b Opa smiled) ,

“ but,
on the other hand, I stick to my

friends, Ign osi .
You have stuck to us and played the part

of a man, and I will stick to you .
But, mind you , I am a

trader, and have to make my living ; so I accept your offer
about those diamonds, in case we should ever be in a posi
tion to avail ourselves of it.
Another thing : we came, as

you know, to look for Incubu

’s (Sir Henry

’s) lost brother.

You must help u sto ﬁnd him .

”

“ That will I do,

” answered Ignosi .
Stay, Infadoos;

by the Sign of the snake round
m y middle, tell me the

truth .
Has any white man to thy knowledge set his foot

within the land ?

”

“ None, 0 Ignosi .

If any white man had been seen or heard Of, wouldst

thou have known it ?

”

I Should certainly have known .
Thou hear est, In cu b u
said Ignosi to Sir Henry
“ he

”

“ Well, well,

there it is ;

I suppose he never got here .
Poor fellow, poor fellow !

So it has all been for nothing .

formed a mass of links scarcely too big to be covered with
both hands .

Do you make these things in this country, Infadoos?

I asked ;

“ they are very beautiful .

”

“ Nay, my lord ; they come down to us from our fore

fathers .
We know not who made them, and there are but

few left .
None but those of royal blood may wear them .

They are magic coats through which no spear can pass .
He who wears them is well

-nigh safe i n the battle .
The

king is well pleased or much afraid, or he would not have
sent them .
Wear them to -night, my lords .

”

The rest of the day we spent quietly resting and talking

over the Situation, which was sufﬁciently exciting .
At

last the su n went down, the thousand watch

-ﬁresglowed

ou t, and through the darkness we heard the tramp of
many feet and the clashing of hundreds
of spears, as the

regiments passed to their appointed places to be ready for
the great dance .
About ten the full moon came up in

Splendor, and as we stood watching her ascent Infadoos
arrived, clad in f ull war toggery, and accompanied by a
guard of twenty men to escort us to the dance.
We had

already, as he recommended, donned the shirts of chain
armor which the king had sent us, putting them on under

ou r ordinary clothing, and ﬁnding to ou r surprise that they
were neither very heavy nor uncomfortable .
These steel

shirts, which had evidently been made for men of a very
large stature, hung somewhat loosely u pon Good and
m y

self, but Sir Henry

’s ﬁtted his magniﬁcent fram e like a

glove.
Then , strapping our revolvers round our waists,

and taking the battle

-axes which the king had sent with

the armor in our hands, we started .

On arriving at the great kraal where we had that morn

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
13 5

ing been interviewed by the king, we found that it was
closely packed with some twenty thousand men arranged
in regiments round it .
The regiments were in turn di

vided into companies, and between each company was a
little path to allow free passage to the witch -ﬁndersto
pass up and down .
Anything more imposing than the

sight that was presented by this vast and orderly
c on

course of armed men it is impossible for
one to conceive.

There they stood perfectly silent, and the moonlight
poured its light upon the forest
of their raised spears,

u pon their majestic forms, waving plumes, and the har

m oniou s shading
of their various

-colored shields . Wher

ever we looked was line upon line of set faces surmounted
by range upon range Of glittering spears .

Surely,

” I said to Infadoos,
the whole army is here ?

”

Nay, Macu m az ahn,

” he answered,

“ but a third part of

it .
One third part is present at this dance each year, an

other third part is mustered outside in case there should
be trouble when the killing begins, ten thousand more
garrison the outposts round Loo, and the rest watch at
the kraals in the country .
Thou seest it is a very great

people .

”

They are very silent ,

” said Good ;
and, indeed, the in

tense stillness among such
a vast concourse
of living men

was almos t overpowering .

“ What says B ou gwan
asked Infadoos
.

I translated .

Those over whom the shadow
of death is hovering

are silent,

” he answered, grimly.

“ Will many be killed ?

”

Very m any .
It seems,

” I said to the others,
that we are going to

assist at a gladiatorial Show arranged regardless of
ex

pense.

”

Sir Henry shivered , and Good said that he wished that

we could get ou t of it.

Tell me ,

” I asked Infadoos
,
are we in danger ?

”

I know not , my lords— I trust not ; but do not seem

afraid .
If ye live through the night all may go well .

The soldiers murmur against the king .

”

All this while we had been advancing steadily towards

the centre
of the Open space, in the midst
of which were

placed some stools .
AS we proceeded we perceived an

other small party coming from the direction of the royal
hut .

It is the king, Twala, and Scragga his son , and Gagool

the
Old, and see, with them are those who slay,

” and he

pointed to a little group of about a dozen gigantic and
savage looking men, armed with spears in
one hand and

heavy kerries in the other.

The king seated himself upon the centre stool, Gagool

crouched at his feet, and the others stood behind .

Greeting, white lords,
he cried , as we came up ;
b e

seated , waste
not the precious time— the night is
all too

Short for the
deeds that must be done .
Ye come in
a

good hour, and Shall see a glorious Show.
Look round

,

white lords ; look round ,

” and he rolled his one wicked eye

from regiment to regim ent .
Can the stars Show ye such

a sight as this
See how they Shake in their wickedness

,

all those who have evil in their hearts and fear the judg
ment of
Heaven above .

’

“ B egi n ! begi n !

” cried
ou t Gagool, i n her thin

“ the hyenas are hungry, they b owl for food .

Then for a moment there was intense

forked wand .
In all there were ten of them.
When

theyarrived in front
of us they halted, and
one
of them,

pointing with her wand towards the crouching ﬁgure
Of

Gagool, cried out

“ Mother, old mother, we are here .

Good! good! good!

” piped
ou t that aged iniquity.

Are your eyes keen, Isanu sis
(witch doctresses) ,

“ ye

”

Mother, they are keen .

”

“ Mother, they are Open .

”

Good! good! good! Are your senses awake, Isanu sis

Are ye ready to do the justice of

“ Mother, we can .

Then go
Tarry not, ye vultures ; see the Slayers

pointing to the ominous group
of executioners behind

make Sharp their Spears ; the white men from afar are

Go .

”

With a wild yell the weird party broke away in every

direction , like fragments from a shell , and, the dry bones
round their waists rattling as they ran, made direct
for

various points
of the dense human circle .
We could not

watch them all, so ﬁxed ou r eyes upon the Isanu si
nearest

us .
When she came within a few paces of the warriors,

She halted and began to dance wildly, turning round and
round with an almost incredible rapidity , and shrieking

ou t sentences such as

“ I smell him, the evil -doer !
”
He

is near, he who poisoned his mother
I hear the

thoughts
of him who thought evil of the king !

”

Quicker and quicker she danced , till
She lashed herself

into such a frenzy
of excitement that the foam ﬂew in

ﬂecks from her gnashing jaws, her eyes seemed to start
from her head, and her ﬂesh to quiver visibly .
Suddenly

She stopped dead, and stiﬁ ened all over, like a pointer dog

when he scents game, and then with outstretched wand
began to creep stealthily towards the soldiers before her.
It seemed to us that as She came their stoicism gave way,
and that they shrank from her.
AS for ourselves, we fol

lowed her
m bvem entswith a horrible fascination .
Pres

ently, still creeping and crouching like a dog, she was b e
fore them .
Then she stopped and pointed, and then again

crept on a pace or two .

Suddenly the end came .
With a shriek She sprang in

and touched a tall warrior with the forked wand .
In

stantly two
of his comrades, those standing immediately

next to him, seized the doomed man , each by one arm, and
advanced with him towards the king.

He did not resist, but we saw that he dragged his limbs

as though they were paralyzed, and hisﬁngers, from which
the Spear had fallen, were limp as those
of a man newly

dead .

AS he came, two
of the villainous executioners stepped

forward to meet him .
Presently they met, and the exe

c u tionersturned round towards the king as though for or
ders .

K

i ll
said the king.

K i ll!

” squeaked Gagool.

Ifi ll
r e -echoed Scragga, with a hollow chuckle .

140
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

Almost before the words were uttered, the horribl e deed

was done .
One man had driven his spear into the victim

’s

heart, and, to make assurance doubly sure, the other had
dashed ou t his brains with his great club .

One,

” counted Twala, the king, just like a black Madam e

Defarge, as Good said, and the body was dragged a few,
paces away and stretched
ou t.

Hardly was this done before another poor wretch was

brought up , like an
ox
to the slaughter.
This time we

could see , from the leopard

-Skin cloak, that the man was

a person of rank .
Again the awful syllables were spoken,

and the victim fell dead .

Two,

” counted the king.

And so the deadly game went
on, till some hundred

bodies were stretched in rows behind u s
.
I have heard of

the gladiatorial shows
of the C aesars, and
of the Spanish

-ﬁghts, but I take the liberty of doubting if they were

not the case here .
The most conﬁrmed sensation -monger

would ﬁght shy
of sensation if he knew that it waswell

on the cards that he would, in his own proper person, be
the subject
of the next

“ event .

Once we rose and tried to remonstrate, but were sternly

repressed by Twala.

“ Let the law take its course, white men .
These dogs

are
m agicians and evil

-doers ; it is well that they should

die,

” was the only answer vouchsafed to us .

About midnight there was a pause .
The witch -ﬁnders

gathered themselves together, apparently exhausted with

their bloody work, and we thought that the whole per

In
a moment all doubts were set at rest, for the old

woman had rushed in and to uched Umbopa, alias Ignosi,

on the shoulder.

I smell him
ou t,

” she shrieked .
Kill him, kill him,

he is full of evil
kill him, the stranger, before blood ﬂows

for him .
Slay him, O king .

There was a pause, which I instantly took advantage of.

O king,

” I called
ou t, rising from my seat,

“ this
m an

is the servant
of thy guests , he is their dog ; whosoever

sheds
the blood of our dog sheds
ou r blood .
By the sa

cred law of hospitality I claim protection for hi m
.

”

Gagool, mother of the witch doctors, has smelled him

ou t ; he must die, white men,

” was the sullen answer.

“ Nay, he Shall not die,

” I replied ;

“ he who tries
to

touch him Shall die indeed .

“ Seize him !

” roared Twala, to the executioners , who

stood around red to the eyes with the blood
of their vic

tims .

They advanced towards us, and then hesitated .
As for

Ignosi , he raised his Spear, and raised it as though deter
mined to sell his life dearly.

“ Stand back, ye dogs,

” I sho uted,

“ if ye would see to

morrow

’s light .
Touch one hair of his head and your king

dies,

” and I covered Twala with my revolver.
Sir Henry

and Good also drew their pistols , Sir Henry pointing his
at the leading executioner, who was advancing to carry out
the sentence, and Good taking a deliberate aim at Gagool .

Twala winced perceptibly, as my barrel came in a line

with his broad chest .

Well,

” I said,

“ what is it to be, Twala

Then he spoke .

P ut away your magic tubes,

jured me in the name of hospitality, and for that reason,
but not from fear
of what ye can do, I spare him .
Go i n

peace!

’

It is well,

” I answered, unconcernedly ;
we are weary

of slaughter, and would Sleep .
Is the dance ended ?”

“ It is ended,

” Twala answered, sulkily .

“ Let these

dogs,

” pointing to the long rows of corpses,

“ be ﬂung ou t

to the hyenas and the vultures,

” and he lifted his spear.

Instantly the regiments began in perfect silence to deﬁle

off through the kraal gateway, a fatigue party only
r e

maining behind to drag away the corpses of those who had
been sacriﬁced .

Then we too rose, and, making our salaam to his m ajesty,

which he hardly deigned to acknowledge, departed to ou r
kraal .

Well ,

” said Sir Henry, as we sat down, having ﬁrst lit

a lamp
of the sort u sed by the K uku anas
, of which the

wick is made of the ﬁbre of a species of palm leaf and the

oil of clariﬁed hippopotamus fat,
well, I feel uncommon

ly inclined to be sick .

”

“ If I had any doubts about helping Umbopa to rebel

against that infernal blackguard,

” put in Good,

“ they are

gone now.
It was as much as I could do to sit still while

that slaughter was going
on .
I tried to keep my eyes

shut, but they would Open just at the wrong time .
I won

Umbopa, my friend, you ought to

be grateful to us ; your skin came near to having an air

“ I am grateful, B ougwan, was U m b Opa

I had translated ,

“ and I shall not forget .
As for Infa

We must wait.

SO we lit ou r pipes and waited.

CHAPTER XI .

W E G I V E A S I G N .

FOR a long while— two hours I should think— we sat

there in silence , for we were too overwhelmed by the rec

ollecti on of the horrors we had seen to talk .
At last, just

as we were thinking of turning in— for already there were
faint streaks
of light i n the east ern Sky— we heard the

sound
of steps .
Then came the challenge
of the sentry

who was posted at the kraal gate , which was apparently
answered, though not in an audible tone, for the steps
came on ; and in another second I nfado oshad entered the
hut, followed by some half a dozen stately

-looking chiefs .

“ My lords,

” he said ,

“ I have come , according to my

word .
My lords and Ignosi , rightful king of the Kuku

anas, I have brought with me these men,

” pointing to the

r ow of chiefs,

“ who are great men among u s, having each

one of them the command of three thousand soldiers, who
live but to do their bidding , under the king

’s .
I have told

them of what I have seen , and what my ears have heard .

N ow let them also see the sacred snake around thee , and
hear thy story , Ignosi, that they may say whether or no
they will make cause with thee against Twala the king .

”

q
answer, Ignosi again stripped off his girdle and ex

hibited the snake
tattooed

‘

ar ou nd him .
Each chief in

turn drew near and examined it by the dim light
of the

lamp, and without saying a word passed on to the other
Side .

plex ity to Sir Henry and Good, and explained the situa
tion .

“ I think I have it,

” said Good, exultingly ;
ask them

to give us a moment to think .

”

I did so, and the chiefs withdrew.
AS soon as they

were gone, Good went to the little box in which his medi
cines were, unlocked it, and took out a note

-book, in the

front of which was an almanac.

“ N ow, look here, you

fellows, isn

’t to -morrow the fourth of June ?

”

We had kept a careful note of the days, so were able to

answer that it was .

“ Very good ; then here we have
it
June, total

eclipse of the sun commences at
Greenwich time,

visible in these islands, Af r i ca, etc .

’
There

’s a Sign for

you .
Tell them that you will darken the sun to

-morrow .

”

The idea was a splendid
one ; indeed, the only fear

about it was a fear lest Good

’s almanac might be incor

rect.
If we made a false prophecy on such a subject, ou r

prestige would be gone forever, and so would Ignosi

’s

chance of the throne of the Kuku anas
.

“ Suppose the almanac is wrong ?

” suggested Sir Henry

to Good, who was busily employed in working out some
thing ou the ﬂy

-leaf of the book .

“ I don

’t
see any reason to suppose anything of the

sort,
was his answer.
Eclipses always come up to

time ; at least, that is my experience of them, and it
es

pecially states that it will be visible in Africa.
I have

worked ou t the reckonings as well as I can without know
ing our exact position ; and I make out that the eclipse
Should begin here about
one o

’clock to -morrow, and last

till half

-past two .
For half an hour or more there should

be total darkness .

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
147

Well,

” said Sir Henry,
I suppose we had better risk

I acquiesced, though doubtfully, for eclipses are queer

cattle to deal with, and sent Umbopa to summon
the

chiefs back .
Presently they came, and I addressed them

thus

“ Great men
of the Kuku anas, and thou , Infadoos
, lis

ten .
We are not fond of showing ou r powers, Since to do

so is to interfere with the course of nature, and plunge
the world into fear and confusion ; but as this matter is
a great
one, and as we are angered against the king b e

cause
of the slaughter we have seen, and because
of the

act of the Isanu si Gagool, who would have put ou r friend

Ignosi to death , we have determined to do so, and to give
such a Sign as all men may see .
Come thither,

” and I led

them to the door of the hut and pointed to the ﬁery ball
Of the rising sun

“ what see ye there

“ We see the rising sun,

” answered the spokesman
of

the party.

“ It is so.
Now tell me, can any mortal man pu t ou t

that sun, so that night comes down on the land at mid
day ?

”

The chief laughed a little .
No, my lord, that no man

can do
The sun is stronger than man who looks on

him .

Ye say SO.
Yet I tell you that this day, one hour af

ter midday, will we put
ou t that sun for a space
of an

hour

, and darkness shall cover the earth, and it shall be

for a Sign that we are indeed men of honor, and that Ig
nosi is indeed king of the Kuku anas
.
If we do this thing

will it satisfy ye

“ Yea

, my lords,

” answered the
old chief with a smile,

148
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

which was reﬂected on the faces
of his companions ;
if

ye do this thing we will be satisﬁed indeed .

”

It shall be done : we three, I ncub u the Elephant, Boug

wan the clear-eyed, and Macu m az ahn, who watches in the
night, have said it, and it shall be done .
Dost thou hear,

Infadoos

“ I hear, my lord, but it is a wonderful thing that ye

promise, to put
ou t the sun, the father of all things, who

shines forever .

”

“ Yet shall we do it, I nfadoos
.

It is well, my lords .
TO

-dav, a little after midday,

will Twala send for my lords to witness the girls dance,
and ~one hour after the dance begins shall the girl whom
Twala thinks the fairest be killed by Scragga, the king

’s

son , as a sacriﬁce to the Silent stone ones, who sit and keep
watch by the mountains yonder,

” and he pointed to the

three strange

-looking peaks where Solomon

’s Road was

supposed to end .
Then let my lords darken the su n, and

save the maiden

’s life , and the people will indeed believe

“ Ay,

” said the old chief, still smiling a little,

“ the peo

ple will believe, indeed .

”

“ Two miles from Loo,
went
on Infadoos,

“ there is a

hill curved like the new moon, a stronghold, where my
regiment, and three other regiments which these men com
mand, are stationed .
This morning we will make a plan

whereby other regiments , two
or three , may be moved

there also .
Then, if my lords can indeed darken the sun

,

in the darkness I will take my lords by the hand and lead
them out
of Loo to this place, where they shall be safe

,

and thence can we make war upon Twala, the king .

“ It is good,

” said I.
Now leave us to sleep awhile

and make ready ou r magic .

distressed to observe presented a remarkably healthy ap

o

pearance, without a Sign of an eclipse anywhere about it.

“ I hope it will come
off ,

” said Sir Henry, doubtfully.

False prophets Often ﬁnd themselves in painful posi

tions .

”

If it does not, it will soon be up with us,

” I answered,

mournfully ;

“ for so sure as we are living men , some
of

those chiefs will tell the whole story to the king, and then
there will be another sort of eclipse, and one that we shall

not like .

Returning to the b u t, we dressed ourselves, putting on

the mail shirts which the king had sent us as before .
Scarcely had we done
so when a messenger came from

Twala to bid us to the great annual

“ dance
of girls

”

which was about to be celebrated.

Taking ou r riﬂes and ammunition with us so as to have

them handy in case we had to ﬂy, as suggested by Infa
doos, we started boldly enough , though with inward fear
and trembling.
The great space in front
of the king

’s

kraal presented a very different appearance from what it
had done
on the previous e vening.
In the place
of the

grim ranks of serried warriors were company after com
pany of K uku ana girls , not overdressed, SO far as clothing
went, but each crowned with a wreath
of ﬂowers, and

holding a palm leaf in one hand and a tall white lily (the
arum) in the other.
In the centre of the Open space sat

Twala, the king, with
old Gagool at hi sfeet, attended by

Infadoos, the boy Scragga, and about a dozen guards .
There were also present about a score
of chiefs, among

whom I recognized most of ou r friends of the night before .

Twala greeted us with much apparent cordiality, though

I saw him ﬁx his one eye viciously on Umbopa.

AS the prospect did n ot seem to be without attractions

t o Good, who was, like most sailors , of a susceptible nat
ure, I, being elderly and wise, and foreseeing the endless
complications that anything
of the sort would involve

(for women bring trouble as s urely as the night follows
the day) , put in a hasty answer

“ Thanks , O king, but we white men wed only with

white women like ourselves .
Your maidens are fair, but

they are

The king laughed .
It is well .
In

proverb which says ,

“ Woman

of them, either in

grace, skill, or personal attractions, came up to the ﬁrst .

At length the king lifted his hand .

Which think ye the fairest, white men ?” he asked .
The ﬁrst,

” said I, unthinkingly.
Next second I
re

gr etted it, for I remembered that Infadooshad said that
the fairest woman was offered
asa sacriﬁce .

Then is my mind as your minds, and my eyes as your

eyes .
She is the fairest ; and a sorry thing it is for her,

for she must die

“ Ay,
m u st di e !

” piped out Gagool, casting a glance

from her quick eyes in the direction of the poor girl, who,

I saw Good

’s hand creep to his revolver.
The poor girl

caught the glint
of the cold steel through her tears, and

it sobered her anguish . She ceased struggling, but merely
clasped her hands convulsively, and stood shuddering
from head to foot .

“ See,

” cried Scragga, in high glee ,

“ she shrinks from

the sight of my little plaything even before She has tasted
it,

” and b e tapped the broad blade of the spear.

If I ever get the chance, you shall pay for that, you

young hound !

” I heard Good mutter beneath his breath .

“ Now that thou art quiet, give us thy name, my dear.

Come, speak up, and fear not,

” Said Gagool in mockery .

Oh, mother,

” answered the girl in trembling accents,

my name is Foulata, of the house of Suko .
Oh, mother,

why must I die
I have done no wrong

“ Be comforted,

” went
on the
old woman , in her hate

ful tone
of mockery;
Thou must die, indeed, as a sacri

ﬁce to the
old ones

” who sit yonder
(and she pointed to

the peaks) ;

“ but it is better to sleep in the night than to

toil in _the day

-time ; it is better to die than to live, and

thou shalt die by the royal hand of the king

’s
own son .

”

The girl Foulata wrung her hands in anguish , and cried

out alo ud :
Oh , cruel ; and I so young ! What have I

done that I should never again see the sun rise ou t Of the
night, or the stars come following on his track in the even

dew is heavy, or listen to the laughing of the waters !
Woe is me, that I shall never see my father

Woe is me, that no lover Shall put his arm around me and

Oh, cruel, cruel !

turned her tear

She was indeed

Prince Arthur

’s appeal to the r uﬂianswho came

to blind him was
not more touching than this savage

But it did not move Gagool or Gagool

’smaster, though

I saw signs of pity among the

' guard behind and
on the

faces Of the chiefs ; and as for Good, he gave a sort of
snort
of indignation, and made a motion as though to go

to her .
With all a woman

’s quickness, the doomed girl

interpreted what was passing in hismind, and with a sud
den movement ﬂung herself before him, and clasped his

beautiful White legs ” with her hands .

Oh , white father from the stars
she cried,

“ throw

over me the mantle
of thy protection ; let me creep into

the shadow
of thy strength, that I may be saved.
Oh,

“ All right, my hearty, I

Good, in nervous Saxon .

Twala turned and motioned to his son, who
advanced

with his spear lifte

‘d .

Now

” whispered Sir Henry to me ;

are you waiting for ?

”

“ I am waiting for the eclipse,

” I answered ;

“ I have

had my eye
on the su n for the last half

-hour, and I never

saw it look healthier.

”

Well, you mu st risk it now
or the girl will be killed.

Twala is losing patience .

”

15 6
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

Recognizing the force
of the argument, having cast

one more despairing look at the bright face Of the sun,

for never did the most ardent astronomer with a theory
to prove await a celestial event with such anxiety, I

stepped, with all the dignity I could command, between
the prostrate girl and the advancing spear of Scragga.

King,

” I said ;
this Shall not be ; we will not tolerate

such a thing ; let the girl go in safety .

”

Twala rose from his seat in his wrath and astonishment,

and from
the chiefs and serried ranks of girls, who had

slowly closed in upon
u s in anticipation of the tragedy,

came a murmur of amazement .

“ Shall n ot be, thou white dog, who yaps at the lion in

his cave
shall not be ! Art thou mad ?
Be careful lest

this chicken

’s
fate overtake thee and those with thee .

How canst thou prevent it ?
Who art thou , that thou

standest between me and my will ?
Withdraw, I say .

Scragga, kill her .
HO, guards
seize these men .

”

At his cry armed men came running swiftly from b e

hind the hut, where they had evidently been placed b e
forehand .

Sir Henry, Good, and Umbopa ranged themselves along

side of me and lifted their riﬂes .

Stop
I shouted, boldly, though at the moment my

heart was in my boots .
Stop !we, the white men from

the stars, say that it shall
not be .
Come but
on e pace

nearer and we will put out the su n and plunge the land in
darkness .
Ye shall taste of

My threat produced an effect ; the men halted, and

Scragga stood still before
u s, hisSpear lifted .

“ Hear him !hear him !

” piped Gagool ;

“ hear the liar

who says he will put ou t the su n like a lamp .

Keep it up , Good ; I can

’t remember any more poetry.

Good responded nobly to the tax upon his inventive

faculties .
Never before had I the faintest conception
of

the breadth and depth and height
of a naval ofﬁcer

j u rgatory powers .
For ten minutes he went
on without

stopping, and he scarcely ever repeated himself .

Meanwhile the dark ring crept on .
Strange and unholy

shadows encroached upon the sunlight, an ominous quiet
ﬁlled the place, the birds chirped out frightened notes and
then were still ; only the cocks began to crow .

On, yet on, crept the ring of darkness ; it was now more

than half over the reddening
orb .
The air grew thick

and dusky .
On, yet on, till we could scarcely see the ﬁerce

faces of the group before us .
No sound
now rose from

the spectators, and Good stopped swearing .

The sun is dying— the wizards have killed the sun ,

yelled
ou t the boy Scragga at last
We shall all die in

the dark,

” and, animated by fear
or fury, or both , he lift

ed his spear and drove it with all his force at Sir Henry

’s

broad chest .
But he had forgotten the mail shirts that

the king had given us, and which we wore beneath
ou r

clothing .
The steel rebounded harmless, and before he

could repeat the blow Sir Henry had snatched the Spear
from
his hand and sent it straight through him .
He

dropped dead .

At the sight, and driven mad with fear at the gathering

gloom, the companies of girls broke up in wild confusion
and ran screeching for the gateways .
N or did the panic

stop there .
The king himself, followed by the guards,

some Of the chiefs, and Gagool, who hobbled away after
them with mar vellous alacrity, ﬂed for the huts, so that

Now, chiefs,

“ we have given you the Sign .

If ye are satisﬁed, let us ﬂy swiftly to the place ye spoke

of.
The charm cannot now be stopped . It will work for

an hour.
Let us take advantage of the darkness.

”

Come,

” said I nfadoos, turning to go, an example which

was followed by the awed chiefs, ourselves, and the girl
Foulata, whom Good took by the hand .

Before we reached the gate
of
the kraal the sun went

ou t altogether.

Holding each other by the hand we stumbled on through

the darkness .

CHAPTER XII .

B A T T L E .

LU GK I LY for us, Infadoosand the chiefs knew all the

pathways of the great town perfectly, so that,
notwith

standing the intense gloom, we made fair progress .

For an hour or more we journeyed on, till at length the

eclipse began to pass, and that edge of the sun which had

disappeared the ﬁrst became again visible .
In another

ﬁve minutes there was sufﬁcient light to
see
ou r where

abouts, and we then discovered that we were clear of the
town of Lo ri ,
and approaching a large, ﬂat
- topped hill,

meas uring some two miles in circumference .
This bill,

which was of a formation very common in Southern Afri
ca, was not very high ; indeed , its greatest elevation was
not more than two hundred feet, b u t it was shaped like a
horseshoe, and itssides were rather precipitous and strewn
with boulders .
On the grass table

-land at the top was

ample camping

-ground, which had been utilized asa mili

tary cantonment of no mean strength .
Its ordinary gar

rison was one regiment
of three thousand men , but as we

toiled
u p the steep Side
of the hill in the returning day

light we perceived that there were many more warriors
than that upon it .

Reaching the table

-land at last, we found crowds Of

men huddled together in the utmost consternation at the
natural phenomenon which they were witnessing. Passing
through these without a word , we gained a hut in the cen

wife and child driven ou t to starve.
Then he pointed out

how the land suffered and groaned under Twala

’s cruel

ru

‘le, Instancing the proceedings
of the previous night,

when, under pretence of their being evil

-doers, many
of

the noblest in the land had been hauled

‘
forth and cruelly

done to death .
Next he went
on to
say that the white

lords from the stars, looking down on the land, had per

ceived its trouble, and determined, at great personal i n
convenience, to alleviate its lot ; how they had accordingly
taken the real king of the country, Ign osi, who was lan

gu ishingin exile, by the hand and led him over the moun
tains ; how they had seen the wickedness of Twala

’sdo

ings, and for a Sign to the wavering, and to save the life

of the girl Foulata , had actually, by the exercise
of their

high magic, put
ou t the
su n and slain the young ﬁend,

Scragga ; and how they were prepared to stand by them,
and assist them to overthrow Twala, and set up the right
ful king, Ignosi , in his place .

He ﬁnished his discourse amid a murmur
of
appr ob a

tion, and then Ignosi stepped forward and began to speak .
Having reiterated all that Infadoos
, his uncle, had said, he

concl uded a powerful speech in these words

O chiefs, captains, soldiers, and people, ye have heard

my words .
Now must ye make choice between me and

him who sits upon my throne, the uncle who killed his
brother, and hunted his brother

’s child forth to die in the

cold and the night .
That I am indeed the king these

pointing to the chiefs
can tell ye , for they have seen

the snake about m y middle .
If I were not the king, would

these white men be on my Side, with all their magic
Trem

ble, chiefs, captains, soldiers, and people ! Is not the dark
ness they have brought upon the land to confound Twala,
and cover our ﬂight, yet before your eyes ?”

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
163

It is,
answered the soldiers .

I am the king ; I say to ye, I am the king

,
went on

Ignosi , drawing up his great stature to its full, and lifting
his broad

-bladed battle

-axe above his head .
If there be

any man among ye who says that it is not
so, let hi m

stand forth , and I will ﬁght him now, and his blood shall
be a
r ed token that I tell ye true.
Let him stand forth

, I

say ;

” and he shook the great axe till it ﬂashed in the su n

light.

As nobody seemed inclined to respond to this heroic

version
of

“ Dilly, Dilly, come and be killed,

”
ou r late

henchman proceeded with his address.

“ I am indeed the king, and if ye do stand by my side

in the battle, if I win the day ye shall go with me to vic
tory and honor.
I will give ye oxen and wives, and ye

shall take place of all the regiments ; and if ye fall I will
fall with ye.

And behold, this promise do I give ye, that when I sit

upon the seat of my fathers, bloodshed shall cease in the
land .
No longer shall ye cry for justice to ﬁnd slau ghter,

no longer shall the witch

-ﬁ nder hunt ye ou t so that ye be

Slain without a cause .
N o man shall die save he who
of

fendeth against the laws.
The
eating up
of your kraals

shall cease ; each shall sleep secure in his own b u t and fear
not, and justice Shall walk blind throughout the land . Have
ye chosen , chiefs, captains, soldiers, and people ?

”

We have chosen, O king,
came back the answer .

It is well .
Turn your heads and
see how Twala

’s

messengers go forth fro m the great town , east and west,
and north
and south, to gather a mighty army to slay me

and ye, and these my friends and my protectors.
To

-mor

r ow, or perchance the next day, will he come with all who

164
KING SOLOMON

are faithful to him .
Then shall I see the man who isi n

deed my man , the man who fears not to die for his cause ;
and I tell ye he Shall not be forgotten in the time of spoil.
I have Spoken , O chiefs, captains, soldiers, and people.
Now go to your huts and make you ready for war.

There was a pause, and then
on e
of the chiefs lifted

his hand , and out rolled the royal salute,

“ K oom
It

was a Sign that the regiments accepted Ignosi as their
king .
Then they marched off in battalions .

Half an hour afterwards we held a council
of war, at

which all the commanders of regiments were present .
It

was evident to us that before very long we Should be
at

tacked i n overwhelming force.
Indeed, from ou r point of

vantage
on
the hill we could
see troops
m astering, and

m essengers going forth from Loo in every direction, doubt
less to summon regiments to the king

’s assistance .
We

had on our side about twenty thousand men , composed of
seven
of the best regiments in the country .
Twala had,

so Infadoos and the chiefs calculated, at least thirty to
thirty -ﬁ ve thousand on whom he could rely at present
assembled in Loo , and they thought that by midday on the
morrow he would be able to gather another ﬁve thousand

or more to his
aid.
It was
, of course, possible that some

of his troops would desert and come over to us , but it was
not a contingency that could be reckoned on .
Meanwhile,

it was clear that active preparations were being made to
subdue us .
Already strong bodies
of armed men were

patrolling round and round the foot of the hill, and there
were other signs of a coming attack .

Infadoos and the chiefs, however, were
of Opinion that

no attack would take place that night, which would b e

has been torn from the black bull, and the king drives him
bleeding about the camp .

”

“ What are Twala

’sterms ?

” I asked, for curiosity.

His terms are merciful, worthy of a great king. These

are the words of Twala, the one

-eyed, the mighty, the hus

band of a thousand wives, lord of the Ku ku anas, keeper of
the great road (Solomon

’s Road) , beloved
of the strange

ones who sit in silence at the mountains yonder (the Three
Witches) , calf
of the black cow, elephant whose tread

shakes the earth , terror of the evil

-doer, ostrich whose feet

devour the desert, huge one, black one, wise one, king from
generation to generation !these are the words
of Twala :

I will have mercy and be satisﬁed with a little blood .

One in every ten shall die, the rest Shall go free ; but

the white man Incub a, who slew Scragga, my son , and

Infadoos
, my brother, who brews rebellion against me,

these shall die by torture as an offering to the silent ones .

’

Such are the merciful words
o f Twala .

”

After consulting with the others a little I answered him

in a loud voice, so that the soldiers might hear, thus

Go back, thou dog, to Twala, who sent thee, and say

that we, Ignosi , veritable king
of the Kuku anas, Incub u ,

reign in his stead .

’
Now go, ere we whip thee away, and

beware how ye lift a hand against such as we .

”

The herald laughed loud.
Ye frighten not men with

such swelling words,

” he cried out .
Show yourselves as

bold to

-morrow, O ye who darken the sun . Be bold, ﬁght,

and be merry, before the crows pick your bones till they
are whiter than your faces .
Farewell ; perhaps we may

meet in the ﬁght ; wait for me, I pray, white m en .

”
And

with this Shaft of sarcasm he retired, and almost im m edi

ately the sun sank .

That night was a busy one for us, for, as far as was pos

sible by the moonlight, all preparations for the morrow

’s

ﬁght were continued . Messengers were constantly coming
and going from the place where we
sat in council .
At

last, about an hour after midnight, everything that could
be done was done, and the camp, save for the occasional
challenge
of a sentry, sank into sleep .
Sir Henry and I,

accompanied by Ignosi and
one
Of the chiefs, descended

the hill and made
the round
of the vedettes .
As we

went, suddenly, from all sorts of unexpected places, spears
gleamed out in the moonlight, only to vanish again as we
uttered the password .
It was clear to us that none were

sleeping at their posts .
Then we returned, picking our

way through thousands
of Sleeping warriors, many
of

whom were taking their last earthly rest .

The moonlight ﬂickered along their spears, and played

upon their features and
m ade them ghastly ; the chilly

night wind tossed their tall and hearselike plumes .
There

they lay in wild confusion , with arms outstretched and
twisted limbs ; their stern, stalwart forms looking weird

and unhuman in the moonlight .

How many of these do you suppose will be alive at

thistime to m orrow
asked Sir Henry.

168
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

I shook my head and looked again at the sleeping m en,

and to my tired and yet excited imagination it seemed as
though death had already touched them .
My mind

’s eye

singled out those who were sealed to slaughter, and there
rushed in upon my heart a great sense of the mystery of
human life, and an overwhelming sorrow at its futility and
sadness .
To

-night these thousands slept their healthy

sleep ; to

-morrow they, and many others with them,
ou r

selves perhaps among them, would be stiﬂ

’eningin the cold ;

their wives would be widows, their children fatherless, and
their place know them no more forever.
Only the oldmoon

would shine serenely
on, the night wind would stir the

grasses, and the wide earth would take its happy rest, even
as it did
eeonsbefore these were, and will do
aeons after

they have been forgotten .

Yet man dies
n ot while the world, at once his mother

and his monument , remains .
His name is forgotten, in

deed, but the breath he breathed yet stirs the pine -tops on
the mountains, the sound of the words he Spoke yet echoes

on through space ; the thoughts his brain gave birth to
we have inherited to

-day ; his passions are
ou r cause
of

life ; the joys and sorrows that he felt are our familiar
friends— the end from which he ﬂed aghast will surely
overtake us also.

Truly the universe isfull of ghosts ; not sheeted, church

yard spectres, but the inextinguishable and immortal ele o
ments
of life, which, having once been,
can never

though they blend and change and change again for
ever.

All sorts
of reﬂections of this sort passed through my

mind— for as I get older I regret to say that a detestable
habit of thinking seems to be getting a hold of me— while

170
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

We got up and dressed ourselves for the fray, each put

e

ting
on his chain -armor Shirt, for which at the present

juncture we felt exceedingly thankful .
Sir Henry went

the whole length about the matter, and dressed himself
like a native warrior .
When you are in K u ku analand,

do as the Ku ku anasdo ,

” he remarked , ashe drew the Shin

ing steel over his broad Sho ulders , which it ﬁtted like a
glove .
Nor did he stop there .
At his request, Infadoos

had provided him with a complete set
of war uniform .

Round his throat he fastened the leopard

-skin cloak
of a

commanding Ofﬁcer, on hisbrows he bound the plume of
black ostrich feathers worn only by generals of high rank,
and round his centre a magniﬁcent moocha
of white
ox

tails .
A pair
of sandals, a leglet
of goat

’s hair, a heavy

“

battle

-axe with a rhinoceros

-horn handle, a round iron

shield covered with white
ox

-hide, and the regulation

number
of tollas, or throwing

-knives, made up his equip

ment, to which , however, he added his revolver.
The dress

was, no doubt, a savage one ; but I am bound to say I
never saw a ﬁner sight than Sir Henry C urtis presented in
this guise .
It Showed off his magniﬁcent physique to the

greatest advantage, and when Ignosi arrived, presently, ar
rayed in Similar costume, I thought to myself that I never
before saw two such Splendid men .
Asfor Good and m y

s elf, the chain armor did not suit us nearly so well .
To

begin with, Good insisted upon keeping
on his trousers,

and a stout , Short gentleman with an eye

-glass, and
one

half of his face shaved, arrayed in a mail shirt carefully
tucked into a very seedy pair of corduroys, looks more
striking than imposing .
As for myself, my chain Shirt

being
too big for me, I put it
on over all my clothes,

which caused i t to bulge
ou t in a somewhat ungainly

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
1

fashion .
I discarded my trousers, however, determined to

go into battle with bare legs, in order to be the lighter in
case it became necessary to retire quickly, retaining only
my veldtschoons
.
This , a Spear, a Shield, which I did not

know how to use, a couple of tollas, a revolver, and a huge

plume , which I pinned into the top
of my shooting -hat in

order to give a bloodthirsty ﬁnish to my appearance, com

pleted my modest equipment.
In addition to all these ar

ti cles, of course we had ou r riﬂes, but as amm unition was
scarce, and they would be useless in case
of a charge, we

had arranged to have them carried behind us by bearers .

As soon as we had equipped ourselves we hastily swal

lowed some food, and then started
ou t to see how things

were progressing .
At
one point in the table

-land
of the

mountain there was a little koppie of brown stone, which
served for the double purpose
of headquarters and a con

ning tower.
Here we found Infadoossurrounded by his

own regiment, the Grays, which was undoubtedly the
ﬁnest in the K uku ana army, and the same which we had
ﬁrst seen at the outlying kraal .
This regiment, now three

thousand ﬁve hundred strong, was being held in reserve,
and the men were lying down on the grass in companies,
and watching the king

’s forces creep
ou t
of Loo in long,

ant -like columns .
There seemed to be no end to those

columns— three in all, and each numbering at least eleven

or twelve thousand men .

As soon as they were clear of the town, they formed up .

Then one body marched
off to the right, one to the left,

and the third came Slowly on towards us .

Ah

,

” said Infadoos
,

“ they are going to attack us on

three sides at once .

”

This was rather serious news, for as
ou r position on the

172
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

top of the mountain, which was at least a mile and a half
in circumference, was an extended
one, it was important

to us to concentrate
ou r comparatively small defending

force as much as possible .
But, as it was impossible for us

to dictate in what way we should be attacked, we had to
make the best of it, and accordingly sent orders to
the

various regiments to prepare to receive the separate

slaughts
.

17 4
KING SOLOMON

him half-way down the neck, which ought, I calculated, to

ﬁnd him in the chest.
He stood quite still and gave
m e

e very opportunity, but whether it was the excitement
or

the wind, or the fact of the man being a long Shot, I don

’t

know, but this was what happened .
Getting dead
on, as

I thought , a ﬁne sight, I pressed, and when the puff
of

smoke had cleared away I, to my disgust, saw my man
standing unharmed, while his orderly, who was at least
three paces to the left, was stretched upon the ground, ap

parently dead .
Turning swiftly, the
oﬂi cer I had aimed

at began to r u n towards his force, in evident alarm .

Bravo , Quatermain
sang ou t Good ;
you

’ve fright

ened him .

”

This made me very angry, for if possible to avoid it, I

hate to miss in public .
When one can only do
one thing

well,
one likes to keep up
one

’

S reputation in that thing.

Moved quite
ou t
of myself at my failure, I did a rash

thing .
Rapidly covering the general as he ran, I let drive

with the second barrel .
The poor man threw up his arms

and fell forward on his face .
This time I had made
no

mistake ; and— I say it as a proof of how little we think of
others when
ou r own pride or reputation are in question

—I was brute enough to

‘feel delighted at the sight .

The regiments who had seen the feat cheered wildly at

this exhibition of the white man

’s magic, which they took

asan omen of Success, while the force to which the gen
eral had belonged— which, indeed, as we afterwards asoer

tained, he had commanded— began to fall back in
confu

sion .
Sir Henry and Good now took up their riﬂes
and

began to ﬁre, the latter industriously

“ browning ” the

dense mass before him with a Winchester repeater, and I
also had another shot or two, with the result that, so far

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
175

aswe could judge, we put some eight
or ten men hors

’ de

com bat before they got ou t of range .

Just as we stopped ﬁring there came an ominous roar

from ou r far right, then a Similar roar from ou r left.
The

two other divisions were engaging us .

At the sound the mass
of men before us Opened ou t a

little, and came
on towards the hill up the Spit
of bare

grass

-land at a Slow trot, singing a deep -throated song as

they advanced .
We kept up a steady ﬁre from ou r riﬂes

as they came, Ignosi joining in occasionally, and accounted
for several men, but Of course produced no more effect

u pon that mighty rush of armed humanity than he who
throws pebbles does on the advancing wave .

On they came, with a shout and the clashing
of spears ;

now they were driving in the outposts we had placed
among the rocks at the foot
of the hill .
After that the

advance was a little Slower, for though as yet we had of

fer ed no serious opposition , the attacking force had to
come up hill, and came Slowly to save their breath .
Our

ﬁrst line
of defence was about half

-way up the side, our

second ﬁfty yards farther back, while
ou r third occupied

the edge of the plain .

On they came, shouting their war

-cry,
Twala

(Twala ! Twala

.

“ I gn osi ! Ign osi ! C

” answered
ou r
peo

ple .
They were quite close now, and the tollas, or throw

ing -knives, began to ﬂash backward and forward, and now
with an awful yell the battle closed in .

To and fro swayed the mass of struggling warriors, men

falling thick as leaves in an autumn wind ; but before
long the superior weight
of the attacking force began to

tell

, and ou r ﬁrst line of defence was slowly pressed back,

17 6

’S MINES .

till it merged into the second.
Here the struggle was very

ﬁerce, but again
ou r people were driven back and up, till

at length , within twenty minutes of the commencement of
the ﬁght, our third line came into action .

But by this time the assailants were much exhausted,

and had, besides, lost many men killed and wounded, and to
break through that third impenetrable hedge of Spears
proved beyond their powers .
For a while the dense mass

of struggling warriors swung backward
and forward in

the ﬁerce ebb and ﬂow of battle, and the issue was doubt
ful .
Sir Henry watched the desperate struggle with a

kindling eye , and then without a word he rushed
off, fol

lowed by Good , and ﬂung himself into the hottest
of the

fray.
As for myself, I stopped where I was.

The soldiers caught sight of his tall form as he plunged

into the battle , andthere rose a cry of

“ N anz i a I ncu bu
(Here i sthe Elephant
Chi elé!

Chi cle .

From that moment the issue was no longer in doubt.

Inch by inch , ﬁghting with desperate gallantry, the attack
ing force was pressed back down the hillside, till at last it
retreated upon its reserves in som ething like confusion .
At that moment , too, a messenger arrived to say that the
left attack had been repulsed, and I was just beginning
to congratulate myself that the affair was over for the
present, when , to
ou r horror, we perceived our men who

had been engaged in the right defence being driven tow
ards us across the plain, followed by swarms of the enemy,
who had evidently succeeded at this point .

Ignosi, who wasstanding by me , took in the situ ati en

at a glance, and issued a rapid order .
Instantly the

of time .
How has it

ended ?

”

They are repulsed at every point for the time .
The

loss is dreadfully heavy ; we have lost quite two thousand
killed and wounded, and they mu st have lost three .
Look,

there

’s a sight !

” and he pointed to long lines
of men
ad

vanci ng by fours .
In the centre
of, and being borne by,

each group of four was a kind of hide tray, of which a

Kuku ana for ce always carried a quantity, with a loop for
a handle at each corner .
On these trays— and their num

ber seemed endless—lay wounded men , who as they ar
rived were hastily examined by the medicine

-men , of

whom ten were attached to each regiment .
If the wound

Wasnot
of a fatal character the sufferer was taken away

and attended to as carefully as circumstances would allow.
But if, on the other hand, the wounded man

’s condition

was hopeless, what followed was very dreadful, though
doubtless it was the truest mercy .
One of the doctors,

under pretence of carrying
ou t an examination, swiftly

Opened an artery with a sharp knife , and in a minute
or

two the sufferer expired painlessly.
There were many

cases that day in which this was done .
In fact, it was

done in most cases when the wound was in the body, for
the gash made by the entry of the enormously broad spears
used by the K uku anasgenerally rendered recovery hope
less .
In most cases the sufferers were already unconscious,

and in others the fatal

“ nick

”
of the artery was done so

swiftly and painlessly that they did not seem to notice it.
Still it was a ghastly sight, and
one from which we were

glad to escape ; indeed, I never re m ember
one which
af

fected me more than seeing those gallant soldiers thus
put out of pain by the red -handed medicine -m en, except,

indeed, on an occasion when, after an attack, I saw a force

of Swazis burying their hopelessly wounded ali ve.

Hurrying from this dreadful scene to the farther Side of

the koppie, we found Sir Henry (who still held a bloody
battle

-axe in his hand) , Ignosi , Infadoos, and one
or two

of the chiefs in deep consultation .

Thank heavens, here
you are, Quatermain ! I can

’t

make ou t what Ignosi wants to do .
It seems that, though

we have beaten
Off the attack, Twala is now receiving

large reinforcements , and is showing a disposition to i n

vest us, with a view of starving us out .

”

That

’s awkward .

”

Yes
especially as Infadoos says that the water sup

ply has given ou t.

”

My lord, that is so,
said Infadoos;

“ the Spring can

not supply the wants
of so great a multitude, and is fail

ing rapidly .
Before night we shall all be thirsty.
Listen,

Macu m az ahn .
Thou art wise, and hast doubtless seen

many wars in the lands from whence thou camest— that is
if, indeed, they make wars in the stars .
Now tell us, what

shall we do ?
Twala has brought up many fresh men to

take the place
of those who have fallen .
But Twala has

learned a lesson ; the hawk did not think to ﬁnd the heron
ready ; but our beak has pierced his breast ; he will
not

strike at us again .
We , too, are wounded, and he will

wait for us to die
he will wind himself round us like a

snake round a buck, and ﬁght the ﬁght of

’

I hear you ,

” I said .

SO, Macu m az ahn, thou seest we have no water here,

and but a little food, and we must choose between these
three things— to languish like a starving lion in his den,

or to strive to break away towards the north, or

here he rose and pointed towards the dense mass
of
ou r

foes
to launch ourselves straight at Twala

’s throat.

Incu b u , the great warrior — for to

-day he fought like a

buffalo in a net, and Twala

’s soldiers went down before

his axe like corn before the b ail; with these eyes I saw it

“
Incub u says

’ but the Elephant is ever prone

to charge .
Now what says Macu m az ahn, the wily old fox ,

who has seen much and loves to bite hi s enemy from b e

The last word is in Ignosi, the king, for it
a

king

’s right to speak
of war ; but let us hear thy voice,

0 Macu m az ahn, who watchest by night, and the voice too

of him of the transparent eye .

”

What sayest thou, Ign osi
I asked .

Nay, my father,

” answered our quondam servant, who

now , clad as he was in the full panoply Of savage war,
looked every inch a warrior king,

“ do thou speak, and let

me, who am but a child in wisdom beside thee, hearken to
thy words .

”

Thus abjured, I, after taking hasty counsel with Good

and Sir Henry, delivered my Opinion brieﬂy to the effect
that, being trapped, ou r best chance, especially in view
of

the failure
of our water supply, was to initiate an attack

upon Twala

’sforces , and then I recommended that the at

tack should be delivered
at once,

“ before
ou r wounds

grew stiff ,

” and also before the sight of Twala

’s over ~

powering force caused the hearts of our soldiers
to wax

small like fat before a ﬁre .

”
Otherwise, I pointed
ou t,

som e of the captains might change their minds, and, mak

ingpeace with Twala, desert to him, or even betray us into
his hands .

This expression
of Opinion seemed, on the whole

, to be

favorably received; indeed, among the K uku anasmy utter

stroyed, as it may happen, there
m ay yet be a king left

to ﬁght for ; and with me shall come Macu m az ahn
the

wise .

It is well, O King, said Infadoos, apparently contem

plating the certainty
of the complete annihilation of his

regiment with perfect calmness .
Truly these K u ku anas

are a wonderful people .
Death has no terrors for them

when it is incurred in the course of duty.

“ And while the eyes
of the multitude of Twala

’sregi

ments are thus ﬁxed upon the ﬁght,

” went on Ignosi ,
be

(i . e.,

about six thousand)
shall creep along the right horn of the

hill and fall upon the left ﬂank of Twala

’sforce, and one

third shall creep along the left horn and fall upon Twala

’s

right ﬂank .
Andwhen I see that the horns are ready to toss

Twala, then will I , with the men who are left to me, charge
home in Twala

’sface, and if fortune goes with us the day

will b e Ours, and before Night drives her horses from the
mountains to the mountains we shall sit in peace at Loo .
And now let us eat and make ready ; and, Infadoos, do
thou prepare, that the plan be carried
ou t ; and stay, let

my white father, B ou gwan, go with the right horn , that his

shining eye m ay give courage to the men .

”

The arrangements for the attack thus brieﬂy indicated

were set in motion with a rapidity that spoke well for the
perfection of the K uku ana military system .
Within little

more than an hour rations had been served
ou t to the men

and devoured, the three divisions were formed, the plan
of attack explained to the leaders, and the whole force ,
with the exception of a guard left with the wounded, now
numbering about eighteen thousand men in all, wasready
to b e pu t in motion.

Presently Good came up and Shook hands with Sir

Henry and myself.

Good

-bye, you fellows,

” he said,

“ I am
off with the

right wing, according to orders ; and so I have come to

shake hands in case we should not meet again, you know,

”

he added, Signiﬁcantly .

We shook hands in silence, and
not without the ex hibi

tion of as much emotion as Englishmen are wont to Show.

“ It is a queer business,

” said Sir Henry, his deep voice

shaking a little,
and I confess I never expect to see to

morrow

’s su n.
As far as I can make out, the Grays, with

whom I am to go, are to ﬁght until they are wiped ou t in

Well, so be it ; at any rate, it will be a man

and gone ; and then Infadooscame up andled Off Sir Henry
to his place in the forefront of the Grays, while, with many
misgivings, I departed with Ignosi to

IN a few more minutes the regiments destined to carry

ou t
th e ﬂanking movements had tramped
off in Silence,

keeping carefully under the lee
of the rising ground in

order to conceal the movement from the keen eyes of

Twala

’s scouts .

Half
an hour
or more was allowed to elapse between

the setting

of the horns
or wings
Of the army before

any movement was made by the Grays and the support

i ng regiments, known as the B u ﬂ aloes, which formed its
chest, and which were destined to bear the brunt
of the

battle .

Both of these regiments were almost perfectly fresh ,

and of full strength, th e Grays having been in reserve in
the morning, and having lost but a small number of men
in sweeping back that part of the attack which had proved
successful in breaking the line
of defence on the occasion

when I charged with them and got knocked silly for my
pains .
As for the Buffaloes, they had formed the third

line of defence on the left, and as the attacking force at
that poi nt had not succeeded in breaking through the sec

ond, had scarcely come into action at all.

Infadoos, who was a wary
old general, and knew the

absolute importance of keeping up the spirits
of his men

on the eve of such a desperate encounter

, employed the

pause in addressing his

There was a moment

’s pause, then suddenly there rose

from the serried phalanxes before
u s a m urmur, like the

distant whisper
of the sea, caused by the gentle tapping

of the handles of six thousand spears against their holders

’

shields .
Slowly it swelled, till itsgrowing volume deep

ened and widened into a roar of rolling noise, that echoed
like thunder against the mountains, and ﬁlled the air with
heavy waves
of sound .
Then it decreased and Slowly

died away into nothing, and suddenly
ou t crashed the

royal salute .

Ignosi, I thought to myself, might well be a proud man

that day, for no Roman emperor ever had such a saluta
tion from gladiators
about to die .

”

Ignosi acknowledged this magniﬁcent act of homage by

lifting his battle

-axe, and then the Grays ﬁled
Off in a

triple

-line formation, each line containing about one thou

sand ﬁghting men, exclusive of Ofﬁcers . When the last line
had gone some ﬁve hundred yards, Ignosi put himself at
the head
of the Buffaloes, which regiment was drawn up

in a similar three

-line
formation , and gave the word to

march , and
off we went, I, needless to
say, uttering the

most heartfelt prayers that I might come out
of that j ob

with a whole skin .
Many ii que er position have I found

myself in, but never before in one quite so unpleasant as
the present, or
on e in which my chance of coming off safe

was so small .

By the time that we reached the edge of the plateau the

Grays were already half

-way down the Slope ending in the

tongue of grass

-land that ran up into the bend of the moun

tain , somethi ng as the frog
of a horse

’s foot runs up into

the shoe .
The excitement in Twala

’s camp on the plain

beyond was very great, and regiment after regiment was
starting forward at a long swinging trot in order to reach
the root of the tongue
of land before the attacking force

could emerge into the plain
of Loo,

This tongue
of land , which was some three hundred

yards in depth, was, even at its root
or widest part, not

more than three hundred and ﬁfty paces across, while at

i ts tip it scarcely
m easured ninety .
The Grays, who, in

passing down the side of the hill and on to the tip of the
tongue, had formed in column, on reaching the spot where
it broadened
o u t again reassumed their triple

-line forma

tion and halted dead .

Then we
that is, the Buffaloes — moved down the tip

of the tongue and took ou r stand in reserve, about one hun
dred yards behind the last line of the Grays, and on slight

ly higher ground .
Meanwhile we had leisure to observe

Twala

’s entire force, which had evidently been reinforced

since the morning attack, and could not now, notwithstand
ing their losses, number less than forty thousand, moving
swiftly up towards u s
.
But as they drew near the root of

the tongue they hesitated, having discovered that only one
regiment could advance into the gorge at a time , and that
there, some seventy yards from the mouth of it, u nassaila
ble except in front, on account of the high walls of boul

der

-strewn ground
on either side, stood the famous regi

ment of Grays, the pride and glory of the Kuku ana army,

ready to hold the way against their forces as the three

188
KING SOLOMON

Romans Once held the bridge against thousands .
They

hesitated, and ﬁnally stopped their advance ; there was no
eagerness to cross spears with those

‘ three lines of grim

warriors who stood so ﬁrm and ready. Presently, however,
a tall general, with the customary head

-dress
of nodding

ostrich plumes, came running up , attended by a group
of

chiefs and orderlies, being, I thought, none other than
Twala him self, and gave an order, and the ﬁrst regiment
raised a shout, and charged
u p towards the Grays, who r e

mained perfectly still and silent until the attacking troops
were within forty yards, and a volley of tollas, or throw
ing

-knives, came rattling among their ranks .
Then suddenly, with a bound
and a roar, they sprang

forward with uplifted spears, and the two regiments met
in deadly strife .
Next second the roll
of the meeting

shields came to
ou r ears like the sound
of thunder, and

the whole plain seemed to be alive with ﬂashes
of light

reflected from
the stabbing spears .
To and fro swu ng

the hea ving mass
of struggling, stabbing humanity, but

not for long. Suddenly the attacking lines seemed to grow
thinner, and then with a slow, long heave the Grays passed
over them, just as a great wave heaves up and passes over
a sunken ridge .
It was done ; that regiment was com

pletely destroyed, but the Grays had but two lines left
now ; a third of their number were dead .

Closing up shoulder to shoulder once more, they halted

in silence and awaited attack ; and I was rejoiced to catch
sight of Sir Henry

’s yellow heard as he moved to and fro,

arranging the ranks .
So he was yet alive

Meanwhile we moved up on
to the ground
of the
en

counter, which was cumbered by about fou r thousand pros
trate human beings, dead, dying, and wounded , and literally

190

Then came a change ; the Grays ceased to give ; they stood
still as a rock, against which the furious waves of spear
men broke again and again, only to recoil .
Presently they

began to move again— forward this time ; as they had no
ﬁrearms there was no smoke, so we could see it all.
Ah

other minute and the onslaught grew fainter.

“ Ah , they are
m en indeed ; they will conquer again ,

called
o ut Ign osi , who was grinding his teeth with ex

ci tem eu t at my Side .
See, i t is done

Suddenly, like puffs of smoke from the mouth of a can

non, the attacking regiment broke away in ﬂying groups,
their white head

-dresses streaming behind them in
. the

wind, and left their opponen ts victors, indeed , but, alas !no

m ore a regiment .
Of the gallant triple line, which , forty

minutes before had gone into action three thousand strong,
there remained at most some si x hundred blood

-bespattered

men ; the rest were under foot . And yet they cheered and
waved their spears in triumph, and then , instead of falling
back upon us as we expected, they ran forward, for a hun
dred yards or SO , after the ﬂying groups
of foemen, took

possession of a gently
rism g knoll
of ground, and , resum

ing the oldtriple formation , formed a threefold ring around
it.
And then, thanks be to God, standing on the top of a

mound for a minute, I saw SII

‘ Henry, apparently unharmed,

and with him
ou r old friend
Infadoos
.
Then Twala

’s

regiments rolled down upon the doomed band, and once
more the battle closed in.

As those who read this history will probably long ago

have gathered, I am, to be honest, a bit
of a coward , and

certainly in no way given to ﬁghting, tho ugh, someho w, it

it, and kept my own blood as undiminished in quantity as
possible, sometimes by a judicious u se of my heels . At this
moment, however, for the ﬁrst time in my life, I felt my bos

om burn with martial ardor.
Warlike fragments from the

“ Ingoldsby Legends,

” together with numbers
of sangui

nary verses from the Old Testament, sprang up in my brain
like mushrooms in the dark ; my blood, which hitherto had
been half-frozen with horror, went beating through
m y

veins, and there came upon me a savage desire to kill and
spare not. I glanced round at the serried ranks of warriors
behind us, and somehow, all in an instant, began to won
der if my face looked like theirs . There they stood, thei r
heads craned forward over their shields , the hands twitch
ing, the lips apart, the ﬁerce features instinct with the hun
gry lust
of battle, and in the eyes a look like the glare

of a bloodhound when he Sights his quarry.

Only Ignosi

’sheart seemed, to judge from his compara

tive self-possession , to all appearance, to beat as calmly as
ever beneath his leopard

-skin cloak, though even he still

kept on grinding his teeth .
I could stand it no longer.

ripe moment ; let

As he spoke a fresh regiment rushed past the ring u pon

the little mound, and, wheeling round, attacked it from the
hither side .

Then, lifting his bat tle -axe, Ignosi gave the signal to ad

vance, and, raising the Ku ku ana battle

-cry, the B uﬂ

’aloes

charged home with a rush like the rush
of the sea .

All I can remember is a wild yet ordered

rushing, that seemed to shake the ground ; a sudden change

of front and forming up on
the part of the regiment

against which the charge was directed ; then an awful
Shock, a dull roar
of voices, and a continuous ﬂashing
of

Spears, seen through a red mist of blood .

When my mind cleared I found myself standing inside

the remnant of the Grays near the top of the mound, and
just behind no less a person than Sir Henry himself. How
I got there I had, at the moment , no idea, but Sir Henry
afterwards told me that I was borne up by the ﬁrst furi

o u scharge
of the B u ﬁ aloes almost to his feet, and then

left, as they in turn were pressed back . Thereon he dashed

o u t of the circle and dragged me into it .

As for the ﬁght that followed, who can describe it ?

the plumes of charging warriors .
The ou tﬂanking squad~

rons had come to our relief.
The time could not have

been better chosen .
All Twala

’sarmy had, as Ignosi had

predicted would be the case, ﬁxed their attention on the
bloody struggle which was raging round the remnant
of

the Grays and the Buffaloes, who were now carrying on a
battle of their
own at a little distance, which two regi

ments had formed the chest of our army.
It was not u n

til the horns were about to close upon them that they had
dreamed of their approach .
And now, before they could

even assume a proper formation for defence, the
o utﬂank

ing Impis had leaped, like greyhounds, on their ﬂanks .

In ﬁve minutes the fate
of the battle was decided.

Taken on both ﬂanks, and dismayed by the awful slaughter
inﬂicted upon them by the Grays and Buffaloes, Twala

’s

regiments broke into ﬂight, and soon the whole plain b e
tween us and Loo was scattered with groups of ﬂying sol
diers, making good their retreat .
As for the forces that

had so recently surrounded us and the Buffaloes, they
melted away as though by magic, and presently we were
left standing there like a rock from which the sea has
r e

treated .
But what a sight it was ! Around us the dead

and dying lay in heaped

- up masses, and
of the gallant

Grays there remained alive but ninety -ﬁve men .
More

than two thousand nine hundred had fallen in this one
regiment most
of them never to rise again .

Men,
said Infadoos
, calmly, as between the intervals

of binding up a wound in his arm b e surveyed what r e
mained to him
of his corps,

“ ye have kept up the repu

tati on
of your regiment, and this day

’s ﬁghting will be

spoken of by your children

’s children.

”
Then he turned

round and shook Sir Henry Curtis by the hand
.

“ Thou

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
195

art a great man, Incu b u ,

” he said , simply ;
I have lived a

long life among warriors , and known many a brave one,
yet have I never seen a man like thee .

”

At this moment the Buffaloes began to march past
ou r

position on the road to Loo , and as they did so a message
was brought to us from Ignosi requesting Infadoos, Sir
Henry, and myself to join him .
Accordingly, orders hav

ing been issued to the remaining ninety men of the Grays
to employ themselves in collecting the wounded, we joined

Ignosi , who informed us that he was pressing on to Loo to
complete the victory by capturing Twala, if that should
be possible .
Before we had gone far we suddenly dis

covered the ﬁgure
of Good sitting
on an ant

-heap about

one hundred paces from us .
Close beside him was the

body of a Ku ku ana.

He must be wounded,

” said Sir Henry, anxiously .

As he made the remark, an untoward thing happened. The
dead body
of the Ku ku ana soldier,
or rather what had

appeared to be his dead body, suddenly sprang up, knocked
Good head over heels off the ant

-heap, and began to spear

him .
We rushed forward in terror,
and as we drew near

we saw the brawny warrior making dig after dig at the
prostrate Good, who at each prod jerked all his limbs into
the air .
Seeing us coming, the K u k u ana gave
one ﬁnal

m ost vicious dig, and with a shout of

“ Take that, wizard ,

”

bolted off.
Good did not move, and we concluded that

ou r poor comrade was done for .
Sadly we came towards

him, and were indeed astonished to ﬁnd him pale and faint
indeed, but with a serene smile upon his face, and his eye
glass still ﬁxed in his eye .

“ Capital armor this,

” he murmured, on catching sight

of ou r faces bending over him

ered that he had been seriously wounded in the leg by a
tolla in the course
of the pursuit, b ut that the chain

-armor

had prevented his last assailant

’s spear fro m
doing any

thing more than bruise him badly .
It was a merciful
es

cape .
AS nothing could be done for him at the moment,

he was placed
on
on e
of the wicker Shields used for the

wounded, and carried along with
u s
.

On arriving before the nearest gate of Loo we found

one of our regiments watching it i n obedience to orders
received from Ignosi .
The remaining regiments were in

the same way watching the other exits to the town .
The

ofﬁcer i n command of this regiment coming up, saluted Ig
nosi as king, and informed him that Twala

’s army had

taken refuge in the town, whither Twala himself had also
escaped, but that he thought they were thoroughly de
moralized, and would surrender .
Thereupon Ign osi, after

taking counsel with us, Sent forward heralds to each gate
ordering the defenders to Open , and promising on his royal
word life and forgiveness to every soldier who laid down
his arms .
The message wasnot without its effect .
Pres

ently, amid
the Shouts and cheers
of
the Buffaloes, the

bridge was dropped across the fosse , and the gates upon
the farther Side ﬂung open .

Taking due precautions against treachery, we marched

on into the town .
All along the roadways stood dejected

warriors , their heads drooping and their shields and spears
at their feet, who,
as Ign osi passed, saluted him as king.

On we marched , straight to Twala

’s kraal .
“ Then we

reached the great space, where a day or two previously
we had seen the review and the witch

-hunt, we found it

deserted.
N o, not quite deserted, for there, on the farther

sinks in blood,

” and he pointed with his red battle

-ax e

towards the ﬁery
orb now going down

“ it is well that

my sun should sink with it .
And now, O king !I am

ready to die, but I crave the b e en
of the K u ku ana royal

house
to die ﬁghting .
Thou canst not refuse it, or even

those cowards who ﬂed tod ay will hold thee shamed .

”

“ It is granted .
Choose— with whom wilt thou ﬁght ?

Myself, I cannot ﬁght with
thee, for the king ﬁghts not

except in war .

”

Twala

’s sombre eye ran up and down our ranks, and I

felt, as for a moment it rested on myself, that the position
had developed a n ew horror.
What if he chose to begin

by ﬁghting
m e
What chance should I have against a

desperate savage six feet ﬁve high , and broad in propor
tion
I might aswell commit suicide at once .
Hastily I

made up my mind to decline the combat , even if I were
hooted
ou t
of K u ku analand as a consequence .
It is, I

think, better to be hooted than to be quartered with a
battle

-axe .

Presently he Spoke .

Incub u , what sayest thou , shall we end what we began

tod ay, or shall I call thee coward , white— even to the
liver

“ Nay,
interposed Ignosi , hastily ;

“ thou shalt not ﬁght

with Incu b u .

”

Not if he is afraid,

” said Twala .

Unfortunately Sir Henry understood this remark, and

the blood ﬂamed up into hischeeks .

It isa law am ong the Ku ku anasthat no m an
of the
royal blood can

b e pu t to death
u nless by his own
consent, which is, however, never
r e

fu sed.
He isallowed to choose a succession of antagonists, to b e approved

by the king, with whom he ﬁghtsuntil one of them killshim
.

I will ﬁght him,

” he said ;

“ he shall
see if I
am

afraid .

”

“ For God

’s sake,

” I entreated,

“ don

’t risk your life

against that
of a desperate man .
Anybody who saw you

tod ay will know that you are not a coward .

”

I will ﬁght him,

” was the sullen answer.
N O living

man Shall
call

‘

m e a coward .
I am ready now !

” and he

stepped forward and lifted his axe .

I wrung my hands over this absurd piece of Quixotism ;

but if he was determined on ﬁghting, of course I could
not stop him .

Fight not, my white brother,
said Ign osi , laying his

hand affectionately on Sir Henry

’s arm ;
thou hast fought

enough , and if aught befell thee at hishands it would cut
my heart in twain .

”

I will ﬁght, Ignosi ,
was Sir Henry

’s answer .

It is well, Incu b u ; thou art a brave man .
It will b e

a good ﬁght .
Behold , Twala, the Elephant is ready for

thee .

”

The ex

-king laughed savagely, and stepped forward and

faced Curtis .
For a moment they stood thus , and the set

ting sun caught their stalwart frames and clothed them
both in ﬁre .
They were a well

-matched pair .

Then they began to circle round each other, their battle

axes raised .

Suddenly Sir Henry sprang forward and struck a fear

ful blo w at Twala, who stepped to one side .
So heavy was

the stroke that the striker half over

-balanced himself, a

circumstance of which his antagonist took a prompt
ad

vantage .
Circling his heavy battle

-axe round his head, he

brought it down with tremendous force .
My heart jumped

into my mouth ; I thought the affair was already ﬁnished.

200
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

But no ; with a quick upward movement
of the left arm

Sir Henry interposed his shield between himself and the
axe, with the result that its outer edge wasshor n clean

Off , the axe falling on his left shoulder, but not heavily
enough to do any serious damage .
In another second Sir

Henry got in another blow, which was also recei ved by
Twala upon his shield .
Then followed blow upon blow,

which were, in turn, either received upon the Shield or
avoided.
The excitement grew intense ; the regiment

which was watching the encounter forgot its discipline,
and, drawing near, shouted and groaned at every stroke .
Just at this time, too, Good, who had been laid
upon the

ground by me, recovered from his faint, and, sitting up ,
perceived what was going on .
In an instant he was up,

and, catching hold
of my arm, hopped about from place

to place
on
one leg, dragging me after him, yelling
ou t

encouragements to Sir Henry

“ Go it,
old fellow !

” he halloed .
That was a good

one
Give it him amidships,

” and so on .

Presently Sir Henry, having caught a fresh stroke upon

his shield, hit
ou t with all his force .
The stroke cut

through Twala

’
S shield and through the tough chain armor

behind it, gashing hi m
in the shoulder .
With a yell
of

pain and fury Twala returned the stroke with interest

,

and, , su ch was his strength, shore right through the rhinoc
eros

-horn handle
of his antagonist

’s battle -axe, strength

ened as it was with bands of steel, wounding Curtis in the
face .

A cry of dismay rose from the Buffaloes as
ou r hero ’s

broad axe

-head fell to the ground ; and Twala, again rais

ing his weapon , ﬂew at him with a shout.
I Shut my eyes .

When I Opened them again, it was to see Sir Henry

came rolling and bounding along the ground towards Ig

~

nosi, stepping just at his feet .
For a second the corpse

stood upright, the blood spouting i n fountains from the
severed arteries ; then with a d ull crash it fell to the earth ,
and the gold torque from the neck went rolling away across
the pavement .
As it did so Sir Henry, overpo wered by

faintness and loss of blood , fell heavily across it .

In a second he was lifted up , and eager hands were pour

ing water on his face .
Another minute, and the great

gray eyes opened wide .

He was not dead .
Then I, just as the su n sank, stepping to where Twala

’s

head lay in the dust, unloosed the diamond from the dead
brows and handed it to Ignosi .

“ Take it,

” I said,

“ lawful king of the K u ku anas
.

Ignosi bound the diadem
upon his brows, and then ad

vancing placed his foot upon the broad chest of his head
less foe and broke out into a chant, or rather a p aean
of

victory, so beautiful, and yet so utterly savage , that I de
spair of being able to give an adequate idea of it .
I once

heard a scholar with a ﬁne

‘ voice read aloud from the Greek

poet Homer, and I remember that the sound of the rolling
lines seemed to make my blood stand still .
Ign osi

’schant ,

uttered as it was in a language as beautiful and sonorous
as the old Greek , produced exactly the same effect on me,
although I was exhausted with toil and many emotions .

N ow,

” he began ,

“ now is our rebellion swallowed up

i n victory, and ou r evil

-doing justiﬁed by strength.

In the morning the Oppressors rose up and shook them

selves ; they bound on their plumes
and made them ready

for war.

“ They rose up and grasped their spears : the soldiers

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
203

called to the captains,
Come, lead us — and the captains

cried to the king,

‘ Direct thou the battle .

’

They rose up in their pride, twenty thousand men, and

yet a twenty thousand .

Their plumes covered the earth as the plumes of a bird

cover her nest ; they shook their spears and shouted, yea,
they hurled their spears into the sunlight ; they lusted for
the battle and were glad .

They came up against me ; their strong ones came

running swiftly to crush me
they cried,

‘ Ha !ha!he is

as
one already dead .

’

“ Then breathed I
on them, and my breath was as the

breath of a storm, and lo !they were not .

My lightnings pierced them ; I licked up their strength

with the lightning of m y spears ; I shook them to the earth
with the thunder of my shouting .

“ They broke— they scattered— they were gone as the

mists
of the morning.

“ They are food for the crows and the foxes, and the

place of battle is fat with their blood .

Where are the mighty ones who rose up i n the m om

Where are the proud ones who tossed their pl umes and

cried,
He is as one already dead

’ ?

“ They bow their heads, but not in sleep ; they are

stretched out, but not in sleep .

“ They are forgotten ; they have gone into the black

ness, and Shall not return ; yea, others shall lead away
their wives, and their children shall remember them no
more .

“ And I— I !the king— like an eagle have I found my

eyrie .

204
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

Behold !far have I wandered in the night -time, yet

have I returned to my little ones at the daybreak .

“ Creep ye under the shadow of my wings, O people,

and I will comfort ye, and ye shall not be dismayed .

Now is the good time , the time of spoil .
Mine are the cattle in the valleys, the virgins in the

kraals are mine also .

The winter is overpast, the summer is at hand .
Now shall Evil cover up her face, and prosperity shall

bloom i n the land like a lily .

“ Rejoice, rejoice, my people ! let all the land rejoice

in that the tyranny is trodden down, in that I am the
king .

”

He paused, and out of the gathering gloom there came

back the deep reply

Thou art the king .

Thus it was that my prophecy to the herald came true,

and within the forty

-eight hours Twala

’sheadless em pire

was stiffening at Twala

’sgate.

206
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

bruises, and I was by no means free.
As a remedy Fou

lata brought us some pounded green leaves with an
ar c

matic odor, which , when applied as a plaster, gave us
considerable relief.
But though the bruises were painful,

they did not give
u s such anxiety as Sir Henry

’s
and

Good

’s wounds .
Good had a hole right through the ﬂeshy

part of his

“ beautiful white leg ,

” from which he had lost

a great deal of blood ; and Sir Henry had a deep cut over
the jaw, inﬂicted by Twala

’s battle

-axe .
Luckily Good

was a very decent surgeon, and as soon as his small box of
medicines was forthcoming, b e, having thoroughly cleansed
the wounds, managed to stitch up ﬁrst Sir Henry

’s and

then his own pretty satisfactorily, considering the imper

fect light given by the primitive K u ku ana lamp i n
the

hut .
Afterwards he plentifully smeared the wounds with

some antiseptic ointment, of which there was a pot in the
little box, and we covered them with the remains
of a

pocket

-handkerchief which we possessed .

Meanwhile Foulata had prepared
u ssome strong broth ,

for we were too weary to eat .
This we swallowed, and

then threw ourselves down on the piles
of
m agniﬁcent

karosses, or fur rugs, which were scattered about the dead
king

’s great hut .
By a very strange instance of the irony

of fate, it was
on Twala

’s own couch , and wrapped in

Twala

’s own particular kaross, that Sir Henry, the man

who had slain him, slept that night.

I say slept ; but after that day

’s work Sleep was
i n

deed diﬂi cult.
To begin with, in very truth the air was

full

Of farewellsto the dying

And m ourningsfor the dead.

From every direction came the sound
of the wailing
of

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
207

women whose husbands, sons, and brothers had perished
in the ﬁght .
No wonder that they wailed, for over twenty

thousand men , or nearly a third of the K u ku ana army, had
been destroyed in that awful struggle .
It was heart -rend

ing to lie and listen to their cries fer those who would
never return ; and it made
one realize the full horror of

the work done that day to further man

’s ambition .
Tow

ards midnight, ho wever, the ceaseless crying of the women
grew less frequent, till at length the silence was only
broken at intervals
of a few minutes by a long, piercing

howl that came from a hut in
ou r immediate rear, and

which I afterwards discovered proceeded fro m
Gagool

wailing for the dead king, Twala .

After that I got a little ﬁ tfu l sleep , only to wake from

time to time with a start, thinking that I was once more
an actor in the terrible events
of the last twenty

-four

hours .
Now I seemed to see that warrior, whom my hand

had sent to his last account, charging at me on the moun
tain

-top ;
n ow I was once more i n that glorious ring
of

Grays , which made its immortal stand against all Twala

’s

regiments , upon the little
m ound ; and
n ow again I
saw

Twala

’s plumed and gory head roll past my feet with

gnashing teeth and glaring eye .
At last, somehow
or

other, the night passed away ; but when dawn broke I
found that my com panions had slept no better than
m y

self .
Good, i ndeed, was
-i n a high fever, and very soon

afterwards began to grow light

-headed, and also, to my

alarm, to spit blood , the result , n o doubt, of some internal
injury inﬂicted by the desperate efforts made by the K u
kuana warrior on the previous day to get his big Spear
through the chain armor .
Sir Henry, however, seemed

pretty fresh , notwithstanding the wound on his face, which

208
KING SOLOMON

'S MINES .

made eating difﬁcult and laughter an impossibility , though
he wasso sore and stiff that he could scarcely stir.

About eight o

’clock we had a visit from I nfadoos, who

seemed but little the worse— tough
old warrior that he

was— for his exertions on the previous day, though he i h
formed
u she had been up all night .
He wasdelighted to

see
u s, though much grieved at Good

’s condition, and

shook hands cordially ; but I noticed that he addressed
Sir Henry with a kind
of reverence, as though he were

something more than man ; and, indeed, as we afterwards
found
o u t, the great Englishman was looked on through

ou t K u ku analand as a supernatural being .
No man, the

soldiers said , could have fought as he fought, or could, at

the end of a day of s uch toil and bloodshed, have slain
Twala, who , in addition to being the king, was supposed
to be the strongest warrior in K u ku analand, in single com
bat, sheering through his bull

-neck
at a stroke .
Indeed .

that stroke became proverbial in K uku analand, and
any

extraordinary blo w or feat
of strength was thenceforth

kno wn as
Incubu

’s blow .

”

I nfadoos told us also that all Twala

’s regiments had

submitted to Ignosi , and that like submissions were begin
ning to arrive from chiefs i n the country .
Twala

’s death

at the hands
of Sir Henry had put an end to all further

chance of disturbance ; for Scragga had been his only son ,
and there wasno rival claimant left alive .

I remarked that Ignosi had swum to the throne through

blood .
The
old chief shrugged his shoulders .

“ Yes

,

” he

answered ;

“ but the K uku ana people can only be kept

cool by letting the blood ﬂow sometimes .
Many were

killed , indeed, but the women were left, and others would
soon grow up to take the places of the fallen .
After this

the land would be quiet for a while .

210
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

After Ignosi

’svisit I went to see Good, and found him

quite delirious . The fever from
hiswound seemed to have

taken a ﬁrm hold Of his system, and to be complicated by
an internal injury .
For four or ﬁve days hiscondition was

most critical ; indeed, I ﬁrmly believe that had it nOt been

for Foulata

’sindefatigable nursing he must have died.

Women are women , all the world over, whatever their

color . Yet someho w it seemed curious to watch this dusky
beauty bending night and day over the fevered man

’s

couch, and performing all the merciful errands Of the sick
room as swiftly, gently, and with
asﬁne
an instinct as a

trained hospital nurse .
For the ﬁrst night or two I tried

to help her, and so did Sir Henry so soon
as his stiff ness

allowed hi m to move , but She bore
ou r interference with

i m patience, and ﬁnally insisted upon
ou r leaving him to

her, saying that
ou r movements
m ade him restless, which

I think was true .
Day and night she watched and tended

him , giving him his only medicine a native cooling drink
made
Of milk, in which was infused the juice Of the bulb

Of a species Of tulip , and keeping the flies from settling

on him .
I can see the whole picture now as it appeared

night after night by the light
Of o u r primitive lamp, Good

tossing to and fro , his features emaciated, hiseyes Shining
large and luminous, and jabbering nonsense by the yard ;
and seated on the ground by his side, her back resting
against the wall Of the hut, the soft

-eyed, shapely K u ku ana

beauty, her whole face, weary as it was, animated by a

lo6k Of inﬁnite compassion— or was it something more than
compassion

For two days we thought that he must die, and crept

about with heavy hearts .
Only Foulata would not b e

lieve it .

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
211

He will live ,

” she said .

For three hundred yards or more around Twala

’s chief

b u t, where the sufferer lay , there was silence ; for by the
king

’s order all who lived in the habitations behind it had,

except Sir Henry and myself, been removed, lest any noise
Should come to the sick man

’s ear .
One night, it was the

ﬁfth night Of his illness, as was my habit I went across to

see how he was getting
on before turning in for a few

hours .

I entered the hut carefully.
The lamp placed upon the

ﬂoor showed the ﬁgure
Of Good, tossing no more, but ly

ing quite still .

SO it had come at last
and in the bitterness Of my heart

I gave something like a sob .

“ Hush— h— h
came from the patch
Of dark shadow

behind Good

’s head .

Then , creeping closer, I saw that he was not dead, but

sleeping soundly, with
Fou lata

’s taper ﬁngers clasped

tightly in hispoor white hand . The crisis had passed, and
he would live .
He slept like that for eighteen hours ; and

I scarcely like to say it , for fear I Should not be believed,
but during that entire period did that devoted girl sit by

hi m
, fearing that if she moved and drew away her hand

it would wake him .
What she must have suffered from

cramp , stiﬁ ness
, and weariness, to say nothing Of want of

food, nobody will ever know ; but it is a fact that, when
at last he woke, she had to be carried away— her limbs
were SO stiff that She could not move them .

After the turn had once been taken, Good

’s recovery

was rapid and complete .
It was not till he was nearly

well that Sir Henry told him Of all he owed to Foulata ;
and when he came to the story Of how she sat by his side

212
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

for eighteen hours, fearing lest by moving she should
wake him, the honest sailor

’s eyes ﬁlled with tears .
He

turned and went straight to the b u t where Foulata was
preparing the midday meal (we were back in
ou r Old

quarters now) , taking me with him to interpret in case he
could not make his meaning clear to her, though I am
bound to say She understood him marvello usly as a rule,
considering how extremely limited was his foreign vocab
ulary.

Tell her,
said Good,
that I owe her my life, and that

I will never forget her kindness .

”

I interpreted, and under her
dark skin
She actually

seemed to blush .

Turning to him with
one of those swift and graceful

motions that in her always reminded me Of the flight Of a
wild bird, she answered softly, glancing at him with her
large brown eyes

“ Nay, my lord ; my lord forgets
Did he not save m y

life , and am I not my lord

’s handmaiden

It will be Observed that the young lady appeared to

have entirely forgotten
the share which Sir Henry and

myself had had in her preservation from Twala

’sclutches .

But that is the way Of women
I remember my dear wife

was just the same.
I retired from that little interview

sad at heart .
I did not like Miss Fou lata

’s soft glances,

for I knew the
fatal amorous propensities Of sailors in

general, and Good i n particular .

There are two things in the world, as I have found it,

which cannot be prevented : you cannot keep a Zulu from
ﬁghting, or a sailor fro m falling in love upon the slightest
provocation

It was a few days after this last occurrence that Ignosi

214
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

Natal speak
Of at Kimberley . There , too, in the Place Of

Death is a secret chamber, known to none but the king
and Gagool .
But Twala, who knew it, is dead, and
I

know it not, nor know I what is in it .
But there is a

legend in the land that once,
m any generations gone, a

white man crossed the mountains, and was led by a wom
an to the secret chamber and Shown the wealth, but before
he could take it she betrayed him, and he was driven by
the king Of the day back to the mountai ns, and Since then
no man has entered the chamber.

”

The story is surely true, Ignosi , for
on the mountains

we found the white man ,

” I said .

Yes, we found him . And now I have promised ye that

if ye can ﬁnd that chamber, and the stones are there

The stone upon thy forehead proves that they are

there,

” I put in , pointing to the great diamond I had taken

from Twala

’sdead brows .

Mayhap ; if they are there,

” he said,
ye shall have as

many as ye can take hence
if, indeed, ye would leave
m e,

my brothers .

”

First we must ﬁnd the chamber,
said I .

There is b u t one who can Show it to thee

-
Gagool .

And if she will not ?

”

Then Shall She die,
said Ignosi , sternly .
I have

saved her alive but for this .
Stay,
she Shall choose

,

”

and, calling to a messenger, he ordered Gagool to be
brought .

In a few minutes she came, hurried along by two guards

,

whom she was cursing as She walked .

“ Leave her,

” said the king to the guards .

As soon
as their support was withdrawn the withered

Old bundle, for
she looked more like a bundle than any

215

thing else, sank into a heap on the ﬂoor, out Of which her
two bright, wicked eyes gleamed like a snake

’s .

What will ye with me, Ignosi
she piped .

“ Ye dare

not touch
m e .
If ye touch me I will blast ye as ye sit.

Beware Of my magic .

”

“ Thy magic could n ot save Twala, Old she

-wolf, and it

cannot hurt me,

” was the answer .
Listen : I will this Of

thee, that thou reveal where is the chamber where are the
shining stones .

”

“ Ha !ha !

” she piped,

“ none know but I, and I will

never tell thee .
The white devils Shall go hence empty

handed)

’

Thou wilt tell me .
I will make thee tell me .

How , 0 king ?

”
Thou art great, but can thy power

wring the truth from a woman ?

”

It is difﬁcult, yet will I do it .
How, O king ?

”

Nay, thus ; if thou tellest not thou shalt slowly die .
Die !

” she shrieked, in terror and fury ;

“ ye dare
not

touch me— man , ye know not who I am .
How Old think

ye am I ?
I knew your fathers , and your fathers

fathers .
When the country was young I was here, when

I cannot die

“ Yet will I slay thee .

art SO Old thou canst no longer love thy life .
What can

life be to such a hag as thee, who hast no Shape, nor form,
nor hair, nor teeth— hast naught, save wickedness and evil
eyes

‘P
It will be mercy to slay thee, Gagool .

”

“ Thou fool,

” shrieked the Old ﬁend,
thou accursed fool,

thinkest thou that life is sweet only to the young
It is

not SO, and naught thou knowest Of the heart
Of man to

think it.
TO the young, indeed, death is sometimes wel

come, for the young can feel .
They love and su ffer, and

it wrings them to
see their beloved pass to the land
of

shadows .
B u t the Old feel not, they love not, and , ha !ha !

they laugh to see another go out into the dark ; ha !ha !
they laugh to see the evil that is done under the su n . All
they love is life, the warm, warm sun , and the Sweet, sweet
air. They are afraid of the cold ; afraid Of the cold and the
dark, ha !ha !ha !

” and the Old hag writhed in ghastly

merriment on the ground .

“ Cease thine evil talk and answer me,
said Ignosi,

angrily

“ Wilt thou Show the place where the stones are,

or wilt thou not ? If thou wilt not, thou diest, even n ow,

”

and he seized a Spear and held it over her .

I will not Show it ; thou dar est not kill me, dar est not

He who slays me will be accursed forever .

”

Slowly Ignosi brought down the spear till it pricked the,

prostrate heap
Of rags .

With a wild yell she sprang to her feet, and then again

fell and rolled upon the ﬂoor .

Nay ; I will Show it . Only let me live, let me sit in the

su n and have a bit Of meat to suck, and I will Show thee .

”

“ It is well .
I thought I should ﬁnd a way to reason

with thee .
To

my white brothers
to the place, and beware
how thou

failest, for if thou

I will not fail, Ignosi .
I always keep my word : ha !

Once a woman showed the place to a white man

“ Her name was Gagool, too.

described in the previous chapter, when we camped in
some huts at the foot Of the

Of mountains was called to which Solomon

Our party consisted
of
ou r three selves and

Foulata
, who waited on u s— especially on Good— Infadoos,

Gagool , who was borne along in a litter, inside which she
could be heard muttering and cursing all day long, and a
party Of guards and attendants . The mountains, or rather
the three peaks Of the mountains , for the whole mass evi

dently consisted Of a solitary upheaval , were, as I have
said, i n the form of a triangle , Of which the base was tow
ards us ,
one peak being
On o u r right,

and
one straight i n front of us .
Never shall I forget the

sight afforded by those th ree towering peaks in the early
sunlight
of the following morning.
High , high above us,

up into the blue air, soared their twisted snow

-wreaths .

Beneath the snow the peaks were purple with heath , and
so were the wild moors that ran up the slopes towards
them .
Straight before us the white ribbon of Solomon

’s

Great Road stretched away u p

-hill to the foot Of the centre

peak, about ﬁve miles from us, and then stopped.
It was

its terminus .

I had better leave the feelings Of intense excitement with

which we set out on our march that morning to the imagi

nation
Of those who read this history .
At last we were

drawing near to the wonderful mines that had been the
cause Of the miserable death Of the Old Portuguese don,
three centuries ago,
of my poor friend, his ill

- starred de

scendant, and also, as we feared, Of George Curtis, Sir
Henry

’s brother.
Were we destined, after all that we had

gone through, to fare any better ?
Evil befell them, as

that Old ﬁend, Gagool , said ; would it also befall us
Some

how, as we were marching up that last stretch Of beauti
ful road, I could not help feeling a little superstitious about
the matter, and SO, I think, did Good and Sir Henry .

For an hour and a half
or more we tramped on u p the

heather

-fringed road, going so fast in ou r excitement that

the bearers with Gagool

’s hammock could scarcely keep

pace with us, and itsoccupant piped out to us to stop .

GO more slowly, white

” she said, projecting her

hideous , shrivelled countenance between the curtains, and
ﬁxing her gleaming eyes
u pon us
why will ye run to

meet the evil that shall befall ye, ye seekers after treas
ure
and she laughed that horrible laugh which al ways

sent a cold shiver down my back , and which for a while
qui te took the enthusiasm
ou t Of u s
.

However, on we went, till we saw before us, and between

ourselves
and the peak, a vast circular hole with Sloping

sides, three hundred feet or mor e in depth, and quite half
a mile round .

Can

’t you guess what this is ?

” I said to Sir Henry and

Good , who were staring in astonishment down into the
awful pit before u s
.

They shook their heads .

Then it is clear that you have never seen the diamond

mines at Kimberley .
You may depend
on it that this is

220
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

Solomon

’s diamond mine ; look there ,

” I said, pointing to

the stiff blue clay which was yet to be seen among the
grass and bushes which clothed the sides Of the pit,

“ the

formation is the same .
I

’ll be bound that if we went

down there we should ﬁnd

‘ pipes

’ Of soapy, brecciated

rock .
Look , too,

” and I pointed

‘ to a series
of worn, ﬁ at

slabs Of rock which were placed
on a gentle Slope below

the level Of a watercourse which had in some past age been
cut
ou t
of the solid rock ;

“ if those are not tables once

used to wash the

‘ stuff,

’ I

’m a D utchman .

”

At the edge of this vast hole, which was the pit marked

on the Old don

’s map, the great road branched into two

and circumvented it .
In many places this circumventing

road wasbuilt entirely Of vast blocks Of stone, apparently
with the Object of supporting the edges Of the pit and pre
venting falls Of reef .
Along this road we pressed, driven

by curiosity to see what the three towering Objects were

which we could discern from the hither side Of the great
hole .
As we got nearer we perceived that they were

colossi Of some sort
or another, and righ tly conjectured

that these were the three
Silent Ones

” that were held in

such awe by the Ku ku ana people .
But it wasnot until we

got quite close that we recognized the full majesty Of these

Silent Ones .

”

There, upon huge pedestals Of dark rock, sculptured in

unknown characters, twenty paces between each , and look
ing down the road which crossed some sixty miles Of plain
to LOO, were three colossal seated forms— two males and

on e female— each measuring about twenty feet from the
crown Of the head to the pedestal .

The female form, which was nude, was of great though

severe beauty, but unfortunately the features were injured

222
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

Before we had ﬁnished examining these extr aordinary

relics
Of remote antiquity, I nfadoos came up, and, having

saluted the
Silent Ones

” by lifting hisspear, asked us if

we intended entering the
Place Of Death

” at once, or if

we would wait till after we had taken food at midday.
If we were ready to go at once, Gagool had announced her
willingness to guide us .
As it was not more than eleven

O

’clock, we— driven to it by a burning curiosity— announced

ou r intention Of proceeding at once , and I suggested that,
in case we should be detained in the cave, we should take
some food with us .
Accordingly
Gagool

’s litter was

brought up, and that

. lady herself assisted
ou t Of it ; and

meanwhile Foulata, at my request, stored some biltong,

or dried game

-ﬂesh, together with a couple
Of gourds Of

water in a reed basket .
Straight in front Of us, at a dis

tance Of some ﬁfty paces from the backs Of the colossi, rose
a sheer wall
Of rock, eighty feet
or more in height, that

gradually Sloped up till it formed the base
of the lofty

snow

-wreathed peak

i
which soared up into the air three

thousand feet above us .
As soon as she was clear
Of her

hammock Gagool cast
one evil grin upon us, and then,

leaning
on a stick, hobbled Off towards the sheer face Of

the rock . We followed her till we came to a narrow portal
solidly arched, that looked like the opening Of a gallery Of
a mine .

Here Gagool was waiting for us, still with that evil grin

upon her horrid face .

“ N ow, white men from the stars,

” she piped ;

“ great

warriors, Incub u , B ougwan, and Macu m az ahn the wise,
are ye ready ?
Behold, I am here to do the bidding Of my

lord the king, and to Show ye the store of bright stones .

We are ready,

” I said .

At thy hands will I require them, and

if a hair Of them be hurt, Gagool, be thou ﬁfty times a

”

I hear, Infadoos; I know thee, thou didst ever love big

words ; when thou wast a babe I remember thou didst
threaten thine own mother.
That was but the other day .

But fear not, fear not ; I live but to do the bidding Of the
king.
I have done the bidding
Of many kings, Infadoos,

till in the end they did mine.

sh e drew a great gourd

“ Art thou coming, Foulata

”

Nay, my lord, whither thou goest, there will I go also .
The deuce you will !

” thought I to myself ;

“ that will

be rather awkward if ever we get ou t Of this .

”

Without further
ado Gagool plunged into the passage,

which was wide enough to admit Of two walking abreast,
and quite dark, we following her voice as she piped to us
to come
on , in some fear and trembling, which was

'

not

allayed by the sound Of a sudden rush of wings .

224
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

Hallo !what

’s that ?

” halloed Good;

“ somebody hit

me in the face .

”

Bats,

” said I ;

“
on you go .

When we had, as far as we could judge, gone some ﬁfty

paces we perceived that the passage was growing faintly
light .
Another minute, and we stood in the most wonder

ful place that the eyes Of living man ever lit on .

Let the reader picture to himself the hall Of the vastest

cathedral he ever stood in, windowless, indeed, but dimly
lighted fro m above (presumably by shafts connected with
the outer air and driven in the roof, which arched away a
hundred feet above
ou r heads) , and he will get some idea

of the size Of the enormous cave in which we stood, with
the difference that this cathedral designed
of nature was

loftier and wider than any built by man .
But itsstup on

dous size was the least Of the wonders Of the place, for,
running in rows adown its length were gigantic pillars of
what looked like ice, but were, in reality , huge stalactites .
It is impossible for me to convey any idea Of the over
powering beauty and grandeur Of these pillars
Of white

sp ar, some
Of which were not less than twenty feet in

diameter at the base, and sprang up in lofty and yet deli
cate beauty Sheer to the distant roof .
Others again were

in process
Of formation .
On the rock ﬂoor there was in

these cases what looked , Sir Henry said , exactly like a
broken column i n an Old Grecian temple, while hi gh above,
depending from the roof, the point
Of a huge icicle could

be dimly seen .
And even as we gazed we could hear the

process going
on, for presently with a tiny splash a drop

Of water would fall from the far

below .
On some columns the drops only fell once in two

or three minutes, and in these cases it would form an i n

her handiwork by the same unvarying laws, utterly irre

‘

Spective of size— were tiny.
One little nook , for instance,

was no larger than an unusu ally big doll

’s house, and yet

it might have been the model Of the whole place, for the
water dropped, the tiny icicles hung, and the spar columns
were forming in just the same way .

We had not time, however, to examine this beautiful

place as thoroughly as we Should have liked to do, for
unfortunately Gagool seemed to be indifferent to stalac

tites, and only anxious to get her business over.
This an

noyed me the more, as I was particularly anxious to dis
cover, if possible, by what system the light was admitted
into the place, and whether it was by the hand
of man or

Of nature that this was done ; also if it had been used in
any way in ancient times, as seemed probable .
However,

we consoled ourselves with the idea that we would examine
it thoroughly On our return, and followed On after ou r u n
canny guide .

On she led
u s, straight to the top of the vast and silent

cave, where we found another doorway, not arched as the
ﬁrst was, but square at the top , something like the door
ways
Of Egyptian temples.

Are ye prepared to enter the Place Of Death ?

” asked

Gagool, evidently with a view to making us feel
u ncom

for tab le.

“ Lead
on, Macduff,

” said Good, solemnly, trying to

look as though he was not at all alarmed, as indeed did we
all except Foulata, who caught Good by the ar m for pro

tecti on .

This is getting rather ghastly,

” said Sir Henry, peep

ing into the dark doorway .

“ Come
on, Quatermain

.
Don

’t keep the Old lady waiting !

”
and

KING SOLOMON

227

he politely made way for me to lead the van, for which I
inwardly did not bless him .

Tap , tap , went Old Gagool

’s stick down the passage,

as She trotted along, chuckling hideously ; and, still over
come by some unaccountable presentiment of evil, I hung

‘

back .

Come, get on, Old fellow,
said Good,
or we shall lose

ou r fair guide .

”

Thus adjured, I started down the passage, and after

about twenty paces found myself in a gloomy apartment
some forty feet long by thirty broad and thirty high ,
which in some past age had evidently been hollowed , by

hand

-labor, ou t of the mountain .
This apartment was not

nearly so well lighted as the vast stalactite ante -cave, and
at the ﬁrst glance all I could make ou t was a m assiv e stone
table running its length, with a colossal white ﬁgure at its
head, and life

-Sized white ﬁgures all round it .
Next I

m ade
ou t a brown thing, seated on the table in the centre,

and in another moment my eyes grew accustomed to the
light, and I saw what all these things were, and I was tail
ing out of it as hard as my legs would carry me .
I am not

a nervous man , in a general way, and very little troubled
with superstitions, Of which I have lived to see the folly ;
but I am free to
own that that sight quite upset me, and

had it not been that Sir Henry caught me by the collar
and held me, I do honestly believe that in another ﬁve
minutes I should have been outside that stalactite cave, and
that the promise Of all the diamonds in Kimberley would
not have induced me to enter it again .
But he held me

tight, SO I s topped because I could n ot help myself.
But

next second his eyes got accustomed to the light, too, and

he let go Of me and began to mop the perspiration

his forehead .
Asfor Good, he swore feebly, and Foulata

threw her arms round hisneck and shrieked .

Only Gagool chuckled loud and long.
It was a ghastly sight .
There at the end Of the long

stone table, holdi ng in his skeleton ﬁngers a great white
Spear, sat D eath himself, shaped in the form of a colossal
human Skeleton , ﬁfteen
feet
or more in height .
High

above hi shead he held the spear, as though in the act of
striking ; one bony hand rested
on the stone table before

him , in the position a man assumes on rising from his seat,
while his frame was bent forward so that the vertebrae Of
the neck and the grinning, gleaming skull projected tow
ards us and ﬁxed its hollow eye -places upon us, the jaws
a little Open , as though it were about to speak

Great heavens
said I, faintly, at last,
what can it

And what are
those thi ngs?

” said Good, pointing to

the white company round the table .

“ And what on earth is
that
thi ng?

” Said Sir Henry,

pointing to the brown creature seated on the table .

“ Hee ! hee !hee
laughed Gagool .
TO those who

enter the Hall Of the Dead, evil comes .
Hee

”

Come, Incuba , brave in battle, come and see him thou

Slewest ;

”
and the
Old creature caught his coat in her

Skinny ﬁngers, and led him away towards the table .
We

followed.

Presently She stopped and pointed at the brown Object

seated
on the table .
Sir Henry looked, and started back

with an exclamation ; and no wonder, for there seated,
quite naked ,
on the table, the head which Sir Henry’s

battle

-axe had Shorn from the body resting on its knees,

That the practice Of thus preserving their kings must have
been an ancient
one is evident from the number, which ,

allow
ing for an average reign Of ﬁfteen year
,s would, sup

posing that every king who reigned wasplaced here— an
improbable thing, as Some are sure to have perished in
battle far from home— ﬁx the date
of its commencement

at four and a quarter centuries back .
But the colossal

/far Older than

that, and, unless I am much mistaken , owes his origin to
the same artist who designed the three colossi .
He was

hewn
ou t of a single stalactite, and, looked at as a work

Of art, was most admirably conceived and executed . Good,
who understood anatomy, declared that, SO far ashe could

see, the anatomical design Of the Skeleton was perfect down
to the smallest bones .

My own idea is that this terriﬁc Object was a freak Of

fancy on the part Of some Old

-world sculptor, and that its

presence had suggested to the K uku anasthe idea of plac

i ng their royal dead under its awful presidency.
Or per.

haps it was placed there to frighten away any marauders

who might have designs upon the treasure

I cannot say.
All I can do is to describe it as it is, and the

reader must form his own conclusion .

Such, at any rate, was the white Death and such were the

CHAPTER XVII .

SOLOMON

’S TREASURE

-CHAMBER .

WHILE we had been engaged i n getting over ou r fright,

and in examining the grisly wonders
of the place, Gagool

had been differently occupied . Somehow or other— for she
was marvellously active when she chose— she had scrambled

on to the great table and made her way to where
ou r de

parted friend Twala was placed under the drip , to see,
suggested Good, how he was pickling,

” or for some dark

purpose of her own .
Then she came hobbling back , stop

ping now
and again to address a remark (the tenor Of

which I could not catch) to
one or other
of the shrouded

forms, just as you
or I might greet an Old acquaintance .

Having gone through this mysterious and horrible cere
mony, she squatted herself down on the table immediately

u nder the white Death, and began, so far as I could
m ake

out, to Offer up prayers to it .
The spectacle of this wicked

Old creature pouring out supplications (evil ones, no doubt)
to the arch
- enemy
of mankind was so uncanny that it

caused us to hasten our inspection .

“ Now, Gagool,

” said I, in a low voice— somehow one

did not dare to speak above a whisper in that place
lead

u sto the chamber.

”

The Old creature promptly scrambled down Off the table .

My lords are not afraid ?

” she said , leering up into m y

Lead on .

23 2
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

Good, my lords
and she hobbled round to the back

of the great Death .
Here is the chamber ; let my lords

light the lamp , and enter,

” and She placed the gourd full

of Oil upon the ﬂoor, and leaned herself against the side
Of the cave.
I took out a match, Of which we still had a

few in a box, and lit the rush wick, and then looked for
the doorway , but there was nothing before us but the solid
rock .
Gagool grinned .
The way is there , my lords .

”

D O not jest with us,

” I said, sternly.

I jest not, my lords .
See !

” and
she pointed at the

rock .

AS she did so, on holding up the lamp we perceived that

a mass Of stone was slowly rising from the ﬂoor and van

ishing into the rock above, where doubtless there was a
cavity prepared to receive it .
The mass was of the width

of a good

-sized door, about ten feet high and not less than

ﬁve feet thick .
It m ust have weighed at least twenty or

thirty tons, and was clearly moved upon some simple bal
ance principle, probably the same as that upon which the
opening and shutting
of an ordinary
m odern window is

arranged.
How the principle was set in motion, of course

none Of us saw ; Gagool was careful to avoid that ; but I
have little doubt that there was some very simple lever,
which was moved ever
so little by pressure on a secret

Spot , thereby throwing additional weight on to the hidden
counterbalances , and causing the whole huge mass to be
lifted from the ground .
Very Slowly and gently the great

stone raised itself, till at last it had vanished altogether,
and a dark hole presented itself to us in the place which
it had ﬁlled .

Our excitement was
so intense, as we saw the way to

Solomon

’s treasure

-chamber at last thrown open, that I for

sharply ; and then, Without waiting for an answer, went

on

None knew what happened ; but it came about that

the white man was frightened, for he ﬂung down the goat

stone that thou, Macu m az ahn, didst take from Twala

”

Have none entered here since ?

” I asked, peering again

down the dark passage .

“ None, my lords .
Only the secret of the door hath

been kept, and every king hath Opened it, though he hath
not entered .
There is a saying, that those who enter there

will die within a moon, even asthe white man died in the
cave upon the m ou ntai n,wher e ye found him, Macu m az ahn.
Ha !ha !mine are true words .

Our eyes met as she said it, and I turned Sick and cold .

How did the Old hag know all these things

“ Enter, my lords .
If I speak truth the goat

-skin with

the stones will lie upon the ﬂoor ; and if there is truth as
to whether it is death to enter here, that will ye learn af

terwards
.
Ha !ha !ha !

”
And She hobbled through the

doorway, bearing the light with her ; b u t I confess that
once more I hesitated about following .

“ Oh, confound it all l

” said Good,

“ here goes .
I am

not going to be frightened by that Old devil
and, followed

by Foulata, who, however, evidently did not at all like the
job, for she was Shivering with fear, he plunged into the
passage after Gagool— an example which we quickly fol
lowed .

A few yards down the passage, in the narrow way hewn

KING SOLOMON

23 5

ou t Of the living rock, Gagool had paused, and was waiting

for us .

See, my lords,

” she said , holding the light before her,

those who stored the treasure here ﬂed in haste, and b e

thought them to guard against any who should ﬁnd the
secret Of the door, but had not the time ,

” and she pointed

to large sq uare blocks Of stone, which had, to the height

of two courses (about two feet three) , been placed across
the passage with a view to walling it up .
Along the side

of the passage were similar blocks ready for use, and, most
curious Of all, a heap
of mortar and a couple
of trowels,

which, so far as we had time to examine them, appeared
to be Of a similar Shape and make to those used by work
men of this day.

Here Foulata, who had throughout been in a state
of

great fear and agitation, said that She felt faint and could
go no farther, but would wait there .
Accordingly we

set her down on the unﬁnished wall, placing the basket
of

provisions by her side, and left her to recover.

Following the passage for about ﬁfteen paces farther, we

suddenly came to an elaborately painted wooden door.
It

was standing wide Open .
Whoever was last there had

either
not had the time, or had forgotten to shut it .

A cr oss the thr eshold lay a shi rt bag, f or m ed of
a goat

ski n , that app ear ed to be f u ll of p ebbles
.

“ Hee !hee !white men,

” sniggered Gagool, as the light

from the lamp fell upon it .
What did I tell ye, that the

white man who came here ﬂed in haste, and dropped the

Woman

’s bag— behold it !

”

Good stooped down and lifted it .
It was heavy and

j ingled.

“ By Jove !I believe it

” he said, in

23 6
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

an awed whisper ; and , indeed, the idea
of a small goat

Skin full of diamonds is enough to awe anybody.

GO on,
said Sir Henry, impatiently .
Here, Old lady,

give me the lamp ,

” and , taking it from Gagool

’shand, he

stepped through the doorway and held it high above his
head .

We pressed in after him, forgetful, for the moment, of

the bag
of
diamonds , and found ourselves in Solomon

’s

treasure

-chamber.

At ﬁrst, all that the somewhat faint light given by the

lamp revealed wasa room hewn ou t of the li ving rock, and
apparently not more than ten feet square .
Next there

came into sight, stored one
on the other as high as the

roof, a splendid collectio n
Of elephant

-tusks .
How many

Of them
there were we did not know, for
of course we

could not see how far they went back, but there could not
have been less than the ends of four or ﬁve hundred tusks
Of the ﬁrst quality visible to ou r eyes .
There , alone, was

enough ivory before us to
m ake a
m an wealthy for life .

Perhaps, I thought, it wasfrom this very store that Solo
mon drew his material for his

“ great throne of ivory,

”
of

which there wasnot the like made in any kingdom .

On the Opposite side Of the chamber were about a score

of wooden boxes, something like Martini
- Henry ammu

niti on boxes, only rather larger, and painted red .

There are the diamonds,

” cried I

“ bring the light .

”

Sir Henry did
so, holding it close to the top box,
of

which the lid, rendered rotten by time even in that dry
place, appeared to have been smashed in, probably by Da
Silvestra himself.
Pushing my hand through the hole in

the lid I drew it
ou t full , not
of diamonds, but
of gold

pieces , of a shape that none
of us had seen before

, and

23 8

the open chest.
We looked, and for a moment could make

nothing ou t, on account of a silvery sheen that dazzled us .
When ou r eyes got used to it we saw that the chest was
three -parts full
Of uncut diam onds, most
of them
Of con

sider able size .
S tooping, I picked some up .
Yes, there

was no mistake about it, there was the unmistakable soapy
feel about them .

I fairly gasped as I dropped them .

We are the richest men in the whole world,

” I said.

Monte Cristo is a fool to us .

”

We shall ﬂood the market with di amonds,

” said Good .

Got to get them there ﬁrst,

” suggested Sir Henry.

And we stood with pale faces and stared at each other,

with the lantern in the middle , and the glimmering gems
below, as though we were conspirators about to commit
a crime, instead
Of being, as we thought, the three most

fortunate men on earth .

“ Hee !hee !hee
went
Old Gagool behind us, as she

ﬂitted about like a vampire bat .

“ There are the bright

stones that ye love, white men, as many as ye will
take

them, run the m
through your ﬁngers, eat
of them, hee !

dr ink of them, ha

There was something
so ridiculous at that moment to

my mind in the idea of eating and drinking diamonds , that
I began to laugh outrageously, an example which the oth
ers followed, without knowing why.
There we stood and

shrieked with laughter over the gems which were ours,
which had been found for
as thousands
of years ago by

the patient delvers in the great hole yonder, and stored
for asby Solomon

chance, was written in the characters stamped on the faded
wax that yet adhered to the lids

on the other two, ﬁ rst— not without a feeling of sacrilege

—breaking the seals that fastened them .

; at least

the second one was ; no wretched Da Silvestra had been
ﬁlling goat

-skins
ou t of that .
As for the third chest, it

was only about a fourth full, but the stones were all picked
ones ; none less than twenty carats, and some Of them as
large as pigeon

-eggs .
Some
of these biggest ones, how

ever, we could see by holding them up to the light, were a
little yellow,
Off colored,

” as they call it at Kimberley .

What we did
n ot see, however, was the look
of fearful

malevolence that Old Gagool favored us with as she crept,

crept like a snake, ou t of the treasure

-chamber and down

the passage towards the massive door of solid rock .

Hark ! Cry upon cry comes ringing
u p the vaulted

path .
It is Fou lata

’svoice

“ oh, B ougwan ! help ! help ! the r ockf alls!

Leave go, girl
Then

H élp ! help ! she hasstabbed m e

By now we are running down the passage, and this is

what the light from the lamp falls
on .
The door Of rock

is slowly closing down
it is not three feet from the ﬂoor.

240
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

Near it struggle Foulata and Gagool .
The red blood
Of

the former runs to her knee, but still the brave girl holds
the Oldwitch , who ﬁghts like a wildcat .
Ah
she is free

Foulata falls, and Gagool throws herself on the ground , to
twist herself like a snake through the crack of the closing
stone .
She is u nder— ah,God !too late
too late ! The

stone nips her, and she yells in agony.
Down, do wn, it

comes, all the thirty tons
Of it, slowly pressing her
Old

body against the rock below .
Shriek upon shriek, such as

we never heard, then a long, sickening cr u nch, and the door
was shut j ust as we, rushing down the passage, hurled ou r
selves against it.

It was all done in four seconds .
Then we turned to Foulata .
The poor girl was stabbed

in the body, and could not, I saw, live long.

Ah
B ougwan, I die
gasped the beautiful creature .

She crept ou t— Gagool
I did not see her, I was faint

and the door began to fall
then she came back, and was

looking up the path— and I saw her come in through the
slowly falling door, and caught her and held her, and She
stabbed me, and I di e, B ou gwan .

”

“ Poor girl ! poor girl !

” Good cried
and then, as he

could do nothing else , he fell to kissing her.

“ B ougwan ,

” she said, after a pause,

“ is Macu m az ahn

there ? it grows so dark , I cannot see.

”

Here I am, Foulata .

”

Macu m az ahn, be my tongue for a moment, I pray thee

,

for B ougwan cannot understand me, and before I go into
the darkness— I would speak a word .

”

a Say on , Fo ulata, I will render it .

”

Say to my lord, B ou gwan, that— I love him, and that

I am glad to die because I know that he cannot cumber

242
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

miserable end that awaited
u s was overpowering .
We

saw it all now ; that ﬁend, Gagool , had planned this snare
for us from the ﬁrst .
It would have been just the jest that

her evil mind would have rejoiced in , the idea of the three
white men, whom, for some reason of her own, she had al
ways hated, slowly perishing
of thirst and hunger in the

company of the treasure they had coveted .
I
saw the

point of that sneer Of hers about eating and drinking the
diamonds now .
Perhaps somebody had tried to ser ve t he

poor Old don i n the same way, when he abandoned the skin
full of jewels .

This will never do,
said Sir Henry, hoarsely ;

“ the

lamp will soon go
ou t.
Let us see if we can

’t ﬁnd the

Spring that works the rock .

”

We sprang forward with desperate energy, and, stand

ing i n a bloody ooze, began to feel
u p and down the door

and the sides Of the passage .
But no knob or spring could

we discover.

“ Depend on it,

” I said,

“ it does not work from the i n

side ; if it did Gagool would not have risked trying to
crawl underneath the stone .
It was the knowledge of this

that made her try t o escape at all hazard , curse her .

”

At all events, said Sir Henry, with a hard little laugh ,

retribution was swift ; hers was almost as awful an end

as ours is likely to be .
We can do nothing with the door

let us go back to the treasure - room .

”
We turned and

went, and as we did so I perceived by the unﬁnished wall
across the passage the basket of food which poor Foulata
had carried .
I took it up and brought it with me back to

that accursed treasure

-chamber that was to be our grave.

Then we went back and reverently bore in Foulata

’scorpse,

laying it on the ﬂoor by the boxes of coin.

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
243

Next we seated ourselves, leaning ou r backs against the

three stone chests Of priceless treasures .

“ Let us divide the food ,

” said Sir Henry,
so as to

make it last as long as possible .

”
Accordingly we did so .

It would, we reckoned, make four i nﬁnitesim ally small
meals for each Of us ; enough, say, to support life for a
couple Of days .
Besides the biltong, or dried game -ﬂesh,

there were two gourds
of water, each holding about a

quart .

Now,
said Sir Henry,

“ let us eat and drink, f or to

morrow we die .

We each ate a small portion Of the biltong, and drank

a sip of water.
We had, needless to say, but little
appe

tite, though we were sadly in need of food, and felt better
after swallowing i t.
Then we got up and made a sys

tem ati c exam ination
of the walls
of
ou r prison

-house, in

the faint hope
of ﬁnding some means Of exit, sounding

them and the ﬂoor carefully .

There was none .
It was not probable that there would

be one to a treasure

-cham ber.

The lamp began to burn dim .
The fat was nearly ex

hansted .

Quatermain ,
said Sir Henry,
what is the time— your

watch goes ?

”

I drew it
ou t and looked at it .
It was six O

’clock ; we

had entered the cave at eleven .

Infadoos will miss us ,

” I suggested .
If we do
not

return
to

-night he will search
for us in the morning,

Curtis .

”

“ He may search in vain .
He does not know the secret

of the door, nor e ven where it is .
N O living person knew

it yesterday, except Gagool .
TO

-day no
one knows it.

244
KING SOLOMON

’S MINE S .

Even if he found the door he could not break it down .
All the K uku ana army could not break through ﬁ ve feet

of living rock .
My friends, I see nothing for it but to

bow ourselves to the will of the Almighty .
The search

for treasure has brought many to a bad end ; we shall go
to s well their number .

”

The lamp grew dimmer yet .
Presently it ﬂared up
and showed the whole scene in

strong relief, the great mass
Of white tusks, the boxes full

of gold, the corpse Of poor Foulata stretched before them,
the goat

-skin full Of treasure, the
dim
glimmer Of the

diamonds, and the wild, wan faces of us three white men

seated there awaiting death by starvation .

Suddenly it sank, and expired.

246
KING SOLOMON

’S MINE S .

me .
There around us lay treasures enough to pay
off a

moderate national debt, or to build a ﬂeet
of iron

-clads,

and yet we would gladly have bartered them all for the
faintest chance of escape .
Soon , doubtless, we should b e

glad to exchange them for a bit of food or a cup
Of water,

and, after that, even for the speedy close to ou r sufferings .
Truly wealth , which men spend all their lives in acquiring,
is a valueless thing at the last .

And so the night wore on .

“ Go od,

” said Sir Henry

’s voice at last, and it sounded

awful in the intense stillness,

“ how many matches have

you in the box ?

”

Eight, Curtis .

“ Strike one, and let us see the time .
He did SO , and in contrast to the dense darkness the

ﬂame nearly blinded us .
It wasﬁve O

’clock by my watch .

The beautiful dawn was now blushing on the snow

-wreaths

far over
ou r heads, and the breeze would be stirring the

night mists in the hollows.

We
had better eat something
and keep
up
our

strength ,

” said I .

What is the good Of eating ?

” answered Good

“ the

sooner we die and get it over the better .

”

While there is life there is hope,

” said Sir Henry .

Accordingly we ate and sipped some water, and another

period
of time passed, when somebody suggested that it

might be as well to get as near to the door as possible and
hallo, on the faint chance
of somebody catching a sound

outside .
Accordingly Good, who, from long practice at

sea, has a ﬁne, piercing note, groped his way down the pas

sage and began, and I must say he made a most diabolical

noise
I never heard such yells ; but it might have been

a m osquito buzzing for all the effect it produced.

K IN G
SOLOMON

’S MINES.
247

After a while he gave it up , and came back very thirsty,

and had to have some water.
After that we gave up yell

ing, as it encroached on the supply of water .

So we all sat down once more against ou r chests of use

less diamonds in that dreadful inaction which was one
of

the hardest circumstances
Of our fate ;
and I am bound to

say that, for my part, I gave way in despair.
Laying my

head against Sir Henry

’s broad shoulder, I burst into tears ;

and I think I heard Good gulping away on the other side,
and swearing hoarsely at himself for doing so.

Ah , how good and brave that great man was ! Had we

been two frightened children, and he our nurse, he could
not have treated us more tenderly .
Forgetting his
own

share
Of miseries, he did allhe could to soothe our broken

nerves, telling stories
of men who had been in somewhat

similar circumstances and miraculously escaped ; and when
these failed to cheer us, pointing ou t how, after all, it was
only anticipating an end that must come to us
all, that i t

would soon be over, and that death from exhaustion was a
merciful one (which is not true)

.
Then , In a diﬂident sort

of a way, as I had once before heard him do, he suggested
that we should throw Ourselves on the mercy of a higher
Power, which , for my part, I did with great vigor.

His is a beautiful character, very quiet, b ut very strong .
And so somehow the day went as the
night had gone

(if

, indeed , one can use the terms where all was densest

night) , and when I lit a match to see the time it was seven
O

’clock .

Once more we ate
and drank, and as we did so an idea

occurred to me .

“ How is it,

” said I,

“ that the air in this place keeps

fresh ?
It is thick and heavy, b u t it isperfectly fresh .

”

248
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

Great heavens !” said Good, starting up ,

“ I never

thought of that .
It can

’t come through the stone door,

for it is air -tight, if ever a door was .
It must come from

somewhere .
If there were no current of air in the place

we should have been stiﬂed when we ﬁrst came in .
Let

us have a look .

”

It was wonderful what a change this mere spark of hOpe

wrought i n us .
In a moment we were all three groping

about the place
on
ou r hands and knees, feeling for the

slightest indication of a draught.
Presently my ardor r e

cei ved a check .
I put my hand
on something cold .
It

was poor Fou lata

’sdead face .

For an hour
or more we went on feeling about, till at

last Sir Henry and I gave it up in despair, having got con
siderably hurt by constantly knocking
ou r heads against

tusks, chests, and the sides Of the chamber .
But Good

still persevered, saying, with an approach to cheerfulness,
that it was better than doing nothing.

I say, you fellows,

” he said, presently, in a constrained

sort Of voice,
come here.

”

Needless to say we scrambled over towards him quick

enough .

Quatermain , put your hand here where mine is .
Now,

do you feel anything ?

”

I thi nk I feel air coming up .

N ow listen .

”
He rose and stamped upon the place,

and a ﬂame of hope shot up in
ou r hearts .
I t
r ang

hollow.

With trembling hands I lit a match .
I had only three

left, and we saw that we were in the angle
of the far cor

ner of the chamber, a fact that accounted for ou r not hav
ingnoticed the hollow ring of the place during our form er

25 0
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

there came a parting sound, then
a rush
Of air, and we

were all
on
ou r backs
on the ﬂoor with a great ﬂag

-stone

on the top of us .
Sir Henry

’s strength had done it, and

never did muscular power stand a man in better stead .

“ Light a match , Quatermain,

” he said, as soon
as we

had picked ourselves up and got
one breath ;

“ carefully

now.

I did so, and there before us was, God be praised !the

ﬁ rst step
of
a stone stai r .

Now what is to be done ?

” asked Good.

Follow the stair, of course, and trust to Providence .
Stop !

” said Sir Henry ;

“ Quatermain, get the bit of

biltong and the water that is left ; we may want them .

I went creeping back to our place by the chests for that

purpose, and as I was coming away an idea struck me .
We had not thought much of the diamonds for the last
twenty -four hours or so ; indeed, the idea Of diamonds
was nauseous, seeing what they had entailed upon us ;
but, thought I, I may as well pocket a few in case we ever
should get
ou t Of this ghastly hole .
SO I j u st stuck my

ﬁst into the ﬁrst chest and ﬁlled all the available pockets

of my Shooting

-coat, topping up— this was a happy thought

— with
a couple of handfuls of big ones
ou t
of the third

chest.

“ I say, you fellows,

” I sung
ou t,
won

’t you take some

diamonds with you ?
I

’ve ﬁlled my pockets .

”

“ Oh !hang the diamonds !
” said Sir Henry.

that I may never see another.

”

As for Good, he made
n o answer.
He was, I think,

taking a last farewell
of all that was left of the poor girl

who loved him so Well .
And, curious
asit may seem to

you, my reader, sitting at home at ease and reﬂecting
on

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
25 1

the vast, indeed, the immeasurable, wealth which we were
thus abandoning, I can assure you that if you had passed
some twenty

-eight hours with next to nothing to eat and

drink in that place, you would not have cared to cumber

yourself with diamonds while plunging down into the nu
known bowels
Of the earth , in the wild hope
of escape

from an agonizing death .
If it had not, from the habits

of a lifetime, become a sort
of second nature with me

never to leave anything worth having behind if there was
the slightest chance Of my being able to carry it away, I
am sure I should not have bothered to ﬁll my pockets.

“ Come
on, Quatermain,
said Sir Henry, who was
al

ready standing on the ﬁrst step Of the stone stair.

“ Steady,

I will go ﬁrst .

”

“ Mind where you put your feet ; there may be some

awful hole underneath ,

” said I.

“ Much
more likely to be
another room,
said Sir

Henry, as he slowly descended, counting the steps as he

Went .

When he got
to

“ ﬁfteen ” he stopped .
Here

’s the

bottom,

” he said .
Thank goodness !I think it

’s a pas

sage .
Come on down .

”

Good descended next, and I followed last, and on reach

i ng the bottom lit
one
of the two remaining matches .

By its light we could just see that we were standing i n a
narrow tunnel, which ran right and left at right angles to
the staircase we had descended .
Before we could make

ou t any more the match burned my ﬁngers and went ou t.
Then arose the delicate question Of which way to turn .
Of course it was impossible to know what the tunnel was

or where it ran to, and yet to turn
one way might lead us

to safety, and the other to destruction .
We were utterly

25 2
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

perplexed , till suddenly it struck Good that when I had lit
the match the draught of the passage blew the ﬂame to

the left .

“ Let us go against the draught,

” he said ;

“ air draws

inward, not outward .

”

We took this suggestion,
and, feeling along the wall

with the hand, while trying the ground before at every
step, we departed from that accursed treasure

-chamber
on

ou r terrible quest.
If ever it Should be entered again by

living man, which I do not think it will be, he will ﬁnd a
token
of our presence in the Open chests
of jewels, the

empty lamp , and the white bones
of poor Foulata .

When we had groped our way for about a quarter of an

hour along the passage it suddenly took a sharp turn, or
else was bisected by another, which we followed , only in
course
Of time to be led into a third .
And so it went
on

for some hours .
We seemed to be in a stone labyrinth

which led nowhere .
What all these passages
ar e,
of

course I cannot say, but we thought that they must be the
ancient workings of a mine, of which the various shafts
travelled hither and thither as the ore led them .
This is

the only way in which we could account for such a multi
tude of passages .

At length we halted, thoroughly worn ou t with fatigue,

and with that hope deferred which maketh the heart sick,
and ate up ou r poor remaining piece of biltong, and drank

ou r last sup
of water, for
ou r throats were like lime -kilns .

It seemed to us that we had
escaped Death in the dark

ness of the chamber only to meet him in the darkness of
the tunnels .

As we stood, once more utterly depressed, I thought I

caught a sound, to which I called the attention of the

25 4
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

stretched hand, and we had p ulled him up high and dry
into the tunnel .

“ My word !

” he said, between his gasps,

“ that was

touch and go .
If I hadn

’t caught that rock, and known

how to swim, I should have been done .
It runs like a

mill

-race, and I could feel no bottom .

”

It was clear that this would not do ;
so after Good had

rested a little, and we had drunk our ﬁll from the water

of the subterranean river, which was sweet and fresh , and
washed our faces, which sadly needed it, as well as we
could, we started from the banks
of this African Styx, and

began to retrace our steps along the tunnel, Good drip
ping unpleasantly in front
of us .
At length we came to

another tunnel leading to o u r right.

“ We may as well take it,

” said Sir Henry, wearily ;

all roads are alike here ; we can only go
on till we

drop .

”

Slowly, for a long, long while, we stumbled, utterly

weary, along this
new tunnel, Sir Henry leading now.

Suddenly he stopped, and we bumped up against him .

Look !

” he whispered,

“ is my brain going, o r is that

light ?

”

We stared with all
ou r eyes, and there, yes, there, far

ahead
of us, was a faint glimmering spot, no larger than

a cottage window

- pane .
It was
so faint that I doubt

if any eyes, except those which, like ours, had for days
seen nothing but blackness, could have percei ved it at
all .

With a sort
of gasp
of hope we pushed on .
In ﬁve

minutes there was no longer any doubt : it wasa patch of
faint light.
A minute more and a breath Of real live air

was fanning us .
On we struggled .
All at once the tun

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
25 5

nel narrowed .
Sir Henry went
on his knees .
Smaller

yet it grew, till it was only the size
of a large fox ’s earth

- it was earth now, mind you ; the rock had ceased.

A squeeze, a struggle, and Sir Henry was
o u t, and so

was Good, and so was I, and th e

re above us were the

blessed stars, and in our nostrils was the sweet air ; then
suddenly
something gave, and we were all rolling over

and over and over through grass and bushes and soft

, wet

soil

I
caught at something and stopped .
Sitting
u p, I

halloed lustily .
An answering Shout came from just b e

low, where Sir Henry

’s wild career had been stopped by

some level ground .
I scrambled to hi m
, and found him

unhurt, though breathless .
Then we looked for Good .

A little way
off we found him , to o, jammed in a forked

root .
He was a good deal knocked about, b ut soon

cam e to .

We sat down together there on the grass, and the r ev ul

sion
of feeling was so great that I really think we cried

for joy .
We had escaped from that awful dungeon , that

was SO near to becoming
ou r grave .
Surely some merci

ful Power must have guided
ou r footsteps to the jackal

hole at the termination Of the tunnel (for that is what it
must have been) .
And see, there on the mountains, the

dawn we had never thought to look upon again was blush
ing rosy red .

Presently the gray light stole down the slopes, and we

saw that we were at the bottom, or , rather, nearly at the
bottom

’

,
of the vast pit in front of the entrance to the

cave .
N ow we could make ou t the dim forms of the three

colossi who sat upon its verge .
Doubtless those
awrul

passages, along which we had wandered the ii vei ong m ghz,

25 6
KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .

had originally been, in some way, connected with the great
diamond mine .
As for the subterranean river in the bow

els of the mountain, Heaven only knows what it was
, or

whence it ﬂows, or whither it goes .
I, for one, have no

anxiety to trace its course .

Lighter it grew, and lighter yet .
We could see each

other now, and such a spectacle as we presented I have
never set eyes on before or since .
Gaunt

-checked, hollow

eyed wretches, smeared all over with dust

’ and mud,

bruised, bleeding, the long fear
of imminent death yet

written
on our countenances, we were, indeed, a sight to

frighten the daylight.
And yet it is a solemn fact that

Good

’s eye

-glass was still ﬁxed in Good

’s eye .
I doubt

whether he had ever taken it out at all .
Neither the

darkness, nor the plunge in the subterranean river, nor the
roll down the Slope, had been able to separate Good and
his eye

-glass .

Presently we rose, fearing that
ou r limbs would stiffen

if we stopped there longer, and commenced with slow and
painful steps to struggle up the sloping sides Of the great
pit.
For an hour
or more we toiled steadfastly
u p the

blue clay, dragging ourselves
on by the help
of the roots

and grasses with which it was clothed .

At last it was done, and we stood
on the great road , on

the Side of the pit opposite to the colossi .

By the side of the road, a hundred yards
Off, a ﬁre was

burning in front
of some huts, and round the ﬁre were

ﬁgures .
We made towards them, supporting one another

,

and halting every few paces .
Presently, one of the ﬁg

ures rose, saw us, and fell on to the ground , crying
ou t for

fear.

Infadoos

CHAPTER

r G N O S I

’ S
F A R E W E L L.

TE N days from that eventful morning found us once

more in our old quarters at Loo ; and, strange to say, b ut
little the worse for ou r terrible experience, except that my
stubbly hair came
ou t of that cave about three shades

grayer than it went in, and that Good never was quite the
same after Fou lata

’s death , which seemed to move him

very greatly.
I am bound

“to say that, looking at the

thing from
the point of view of an Oldish man of the

world, I consider her r em ovalw asa fortunate occurrence,
Since, otherwise, complications would have been sure
to

ensue .
The poor creature was no ordinary native girl,

but a person
of great, I had almost said stately, beauty,

and of considerable reﬁnement of mind .
But no amount

of beauty or reﬁnement could have made an entanglement
between Good and herself a desirable occurrence ; for, as
she herself put it,

“ Can the sun mate with the darkness,

or the white with the black ?

”

I need hardly state that we never again penetrated into

Solomon

’s treasure chamber .
After we had recovered

from our fatigues, a process which took us forty
- eight

hours, we descended into the great pit in the hope of
ﬁnding the hole by which we had crept out of the moun
tain, but with no success .
To begin with, rain had fallen,

and obliterated
ou r Spoor ; and what is more, the sides of

the vast pit were full of ant -bear and other holes.
It was

KING SOLOMO N

’S MINES .
5 9

impossible to say tOwhich
of these we owed
ou r salva

tion .
We also, on the day before we started back to LOO,

made a further examination
of the wonders of the stalac

tite cave, and, drawn by a kind
of restless feeling, even

penetrated once more into the Chamber of the Dead ; and,
passing beneath the Spear of the white Death , gazed, with
sensations which it would be quite impossible for me to
describe, at the mass
of rock which had shut us
off from

escape, thinking, the while, of the priceless treasures b e
yond, Of the mysterious
old hag whose ﬂattened frag

ments lay crushed beneath it, and of the fair girl of whose
tomb it was the portal .
I say gazed at the

“ rock ,

” for

examine as we would we could ﬁnd no traces
Of the join

of the sliding door ;
nor , indeed, could
we hi t upon the

secret, now utterly lost , th
worked it, though we tried

for an hour
or more .
It w s certainly a marvellous bit

of mechanism
, characteristic, in its massive and yet inscr u

table simplicity, of the age which produced it ; and I doubt
if the world has such another to show .

At last we gave it up in disgust ; though , if the mass

had suddenly risen before
ou r eyes, I doubt if we Should

have screwed
u p courage to step over Gagool

’s mangled

remains and once more enter the treasure

-chamber, even

in the sure and certain hope of unlimited diamonds .
And

yet I could have cried at the idea of leaving all that treas
ure, the biggest treasure probably that has ever in the
world

’s history been accumulated in one spot .
But there

wasno help for it.
Only dynamite could force its way

through ﬁve feet of solid rock .
And so we left it .
Per

haps, in some remote unborn century, a more fortunate
explorer may hit upon the
Open Sesame,

” and ﬂood the

world with gems .
But, myself, I doubt it .
Somehow, I

260
KING
S OLOMON

’S
m

.

see m to feel that the millions
Of pounds

’ worth of gems

that lie in the three stone coffers will never shine round
the neck
of an earthly beauty. They and Fou lata

’sbones

will keep cold company till the end of all things .

With a sigh of disappointment we made
ou r way back,

and next day started for LOO.
And yet it was really very

ungrateful
of us to be disappointed ; for, as the reader

will remember, I had, by a lucky thought, taken the pre
caution to ﬁll the pockets
of my
Old shooting

-coat with

gems before we left our prison

-house .
A good many of

these fell out in the course of ou r roll down the side of the
pit, including most of the big ones, which I had crammed
in on the top .
But, comparatively speaking, an enormous

quantity still remained, including eighteen large stones
ranging from about one hundred to thirty carats in weight.
My Old shooting

-coat still held enough treasure to make

us all, i f not millionaires , at least exceedingly wealthy
men , and yet to keep enough stones each to make the three
ﬁnest sets
of gems in Europe.
So we had
not done so

badly.

On arriving at LOO we were most cordially received by

Ignosi, whom we found well , and busily engaged in con
solidating his power and reorganizing the regiments which

had suffered most in the great struggle with Twala .

He listened with breathless interest to our wonderful

story ; but when we told him of old Gagool

’sfrightful end,

he grew thoughtful .

“ Come hither,

” he
called, to a very
old Induna (coun

cillor) , who was sitting with others in a circle round the
king, but ou t of ear

-shot .
The Old man rose, approached,

saluted, and seated himself.

“ Thou art 0 1
said Ignosi .

262
K ING SOLOM ON

’S MI N E S .

Ignosi covered hisface with his hands for a while before

answering .

“ My heart is sore,

” he said at last ;
your words split

my heart in twain .
What have I done to ye, Incub a,

Macu m az ahn, and B ou gwan, that ye should leave me des
olate ?
Ye who stood by me in rebellion
and battle, will

ye leave me in the day of peace and victory ?
What will

ye— wives ?
Choose from ou t the land !

' A place to live

in ?
Behold, the land isyours as far as ye can see .
The

Ye shall teach my people how to

build them .
Cattle for beef and milk ?
Every married

man Shall bring ye an ox or a cow.
Wild game to hunt ?

Does

—not the elephant walk through my forests , and the

river

-horse sleep i n the re eds ? Would ye make war ?
My

Impis (regimen ts) wait your word .
If there is a nything

more that I can gi ve, that will I give ye .

”

“ Nay, Ignosi , we want
not these
things,

” I answered ;

we would seek our own place .

“ Now do I perceive,

” said
Ignosi , bitterly, and with

ﬂashing eyes ,

“ that it is the bright stones that ye love

more than me, your friend .
Ye have the stones ; now

would ye go to Natal and across the black

'

water and sell

them , and be rich, as it is the desire of a white man

’s heart

to be ,
Cursed for your sake be the stones , and cursed he

who seeks them .
Death shall it be to him who sets foot

i n the Place of Death to seek them
. I have Spoken, white

m en ; ye can go .

I laid my hand upon his arm .
Ignosi ,

” I said,

“ tell

u s, when thou didst wander in Zululand, and among the
white men in Natal , did
not thine heart turn to the land

thy mother told thee of, thy native land, where thou didst

see the light , and play when thou wast little, the land where
thy place was ?

KIN G SOLOMON

263

It was even so, Macu m az ahn .
Then thus does our heart turn to ou r land and to our

own place .

”

Then cam e a pause .
When Ignosi broke it, it was in a

different voice .

I do perceive that thy words are, now as ever, wise

and full
of reason , Macu m az ahn ; that which ﬂies in the

air loves not to run along the ground ; the white man loves
not to live
on the level of the black .
Well, ye must go,

and leave my heart sore , because ye will be as dead to me,
since from where ye will

!be no tidings can come to m e .

But listen , and let all the white men know my words .

No other white man shall cross the mountains, even if any
may live to come so far.
I will see no traders with their

guns and rum .
My people shall ﬁght with the spear and

drink water, like their forefathers before them .
I will

have no praying

-men to put fear Of death into men

’s hearts ,

to stir them u p against the king, and make a path for the
white men who follow to run on .
If a white man comes

to my gates I will send him back ; if a hundred come, I
will push them back ; if an army comes, I will
m ake war

on them with all my strength , and they shall
not prevail

against me .
None shall ever come for the Shining stones ;

n o, n ot an army, for if they come I will send a regiment
and ﬁll up the pit, and break down the white columns in
the caves
and fill them with
rocks, so that none can come

even to that door Of which ye speak, and whereof the way
to move it is lost.
But for ye three, Incub u , Macu m az ahn,

and B ougwan, the path is always Open ; for behold, ye are
dearer to me than aught that breathes .

“ And ye would go .
Infadoos, my uncle, and m y In

There is, as I have learned, another way across

the mountains that he Shall Show ye . Farewell, my broth

ers, brave white men . See me no more, for I have no heart
to bear it .
Behold, I make a decree, and it shall be pub

Incub u , Macu m az ahn, and B ou gwan, Shall be as the names

of dead kings, and he who Speaks them shall die .! So shall
your memory be preserved in the land forever.

“ GO, now, ere my eyes rain tears like a woman

’s .
At

times when ye look back down the path of life, or when
ye are Old and gather yourselves together to crouch before
the ﬁre, because the su n has no more heat, ye will think of
how we stood shoulder to shoulder in that great battle that

of how thou wast

”

He rose, looked earnestly at us for a few seconds, and

then threw the corner of his kaross over his head, so as to
cover his face from us.

We went in silence .
Next day at dawn we left LOO, escorted by our oldfriend

I nfadoos, who was heart—broken at ou r departure , and the

parent eye,

” they wearied more
or less, but
of his legs,

never.

As we travelled, I nfadoostold us that there was another

pass

' over the mountains to the north of the
one followed

by Solomon

’s Great Road, or rather that there was a place

where it was possible to climb down the wall of cliff that
separated K uku analand from the desert, and was broken

hy

' the towering shapes of Sheba

’s breasts.
It appeared,

too, that rather more than two years previously a party of

Ku ku ana hunters had descended this path into the desert
in search
of ostriches, whose plumes were much prized

among them for war head dresses, and that in the course
of their hunt they had been led far from the mountains,
and were much troubled by thirst .
Seeing, however, trees

on the horizon , they made towards them, and discovered a
large and fertile oasis of some miles in extent, and plenti
fully watered.
It was by way of this oasis that he suggest

ed that we should return , and the idea seemed to us a good
one, as it appeared that we Should escape the rigors of the
mountain pass, and as some of the hunters were in attend
ance to guide us to the oasis, from which, they stated, they
could perceive m ore fertile spots far away in the desert .!

It
often pu z zled all
of
us to
u nderstand how it was p ossible that

Ignosi

’s m other , beari ng
the
child with her, should have
su rvi ved the

dangersof the j ou rney acrossthe m ou ntainsand the desert, dangerswhich

so
nearly proved fatal to
ourselves
.
It has since occu rred to

gi ve the idea to the reader for what it isworth, that she m ust have taken

this second route, and wandered out like Hagar into the deser t.
If she

did so, there is no longer
anything inexplicable ab ou t the story, since she

m ay well, asIgnosi him self related, have been picked u p by som e ostrich

huntersbefore she
or the
child were
exhau sted, and led by them
to the

oasis, and thence by stagesto the fertile country, and so on by slow de
grees southward to Zululand—A. Q.

Travelling easily, on the night of the fourth day

’s jour

ney we found ourselves once more
on the crest
of the

mountains that separate K u ku an aland from the desert

,

which rolled away in sandy billows at ou r feet, and about
twenty

-ﬁve miles to the north of Sheba

’s breasts .

At dawn
on the following day we were led to the
com

m encem ent
of a precipitous descent, by which we were to

descend the precipice, and gain the desert two thousand
and more feet below .

Here we bade farewell to that true friend and sturdy Old

warrior, Infadoos, who solemnly wished all good upon
u s,

and nearly wept with grief.
Never, my lords,

” he said,

shall mine
Old eyes see the like
of ye again .
Ah !the

way that Incu b u cut his men down in the battle ! Ah !

for the sight
of that stroke with which he swept
Off my

brother Twala

’s head ! It was beautiful— beautiful ! I

may never hOpe to see such another, except perchance in
happy dr eams .

”

We were very sorry to part from him ; indeed, Good was

SO moved that he gave him as a souvenir— what do you
think
— an eye

-glass
.
(Afterwards we discovered that it

was a Spare one .)
Infadooswas delighted, foreseeing that

the possession of such an article would enormously increase
his prestige, and after several vain attempts actually su c

ceeded in screwing it into his
own eye .
Anything more

incongruous than the Old warrior looked with an eye -glass
I never saw .
Eye

-glasses don

’t go well with leopard-skin

cloaks and black ostrich plumes .

Then, having seen that ou r guides were well laden with

water and provisions , and having received a thundering
farewell salute from the Buffaloes, we wrung the Old war

rior

’s hand, and began
ou r downward climb .
A very

268

arduous business it proved to be, but somehow that even
ing we found ourselves at the bottom without accident.

D O you know,

” said Sir Henry that night, as we sat

by
ou r ﬁre and gazed up at the beetling cliffs above us,

I think that there are worse places than K uku analandin

the world, and that I have Spent unhappier tim es than the
last month
or two, though I have never spent such queer

ones .
Eh !you fellows ?

”

I almost wish I were back,

” said Good, with a sigh .

As for myself, I reﬂected that all

’s well that ends well ;

but in the course of a long life of Shaves I never had such
shaves as those I had recently experienced.
The thought

of that battle still makes me feel cold all over, and as for

ou r experience in the treasure

-chamber

Next morning we started on a toilsome march across the

desert, having with us a good supply of water carried by

ou r ﬁve guides, and camped that night in the Open, start
ing again at dawn on the morrow .

By midday of the third day

’s journey we could see the

trees
of the oasis
of which the guides Spoke, and by an

hour before sundown we were once more walking upon
grass and listeningto the sound of running water.

great cry, and came hobbling towards us .
When he got

close he fell down in a sort of faint.

With a spring Sir Henry was by his Side .

Great Powers
he cried,
i t i s m y br other George !

”

At the sound of the disturbance another ﬁgure, also clad

in skins, emerged from the b u t with a gun in his hand, and
came running towards us .
On seeing me he too gave a cry .

Macu m az ahn,

” he halloed,

“ don

’t you know me, Baas

I

’m Jim, the hunter.
I lost the note you gave me to give

to the Baas, and we have been here nearly two years .”

And the fellow fell at my feet and rolled over and over,
weeping for joy .

”

You careless scoundrel
I said ;

“ you ought to be

well hided .

”

Meanwhile the m an with the black beard had recovered

and got up , and he and Sir Henry were pump

-handling

away at each other, apparently without a word to say .
But whatever they had quarrelled about in the past (I
suspect it was a lady, though I never asked) , it wasevi

dently forgotten now.

“ My dear
Old fellow,
burst out Si r Henry at last,
I

thought that you were dead .
I have b een over Solomon

’s

Mountains to ﬁnd you , and now I come across you perched
in the desert, like an old Aas gel

I tried to go over Solomon

’s Mountains nearly two

years ago, was the answer, spoken in the hesitating voice

of a man who has had little recent opportunity of using his
tongue,

“ but when I got here , a boulder fell on my leg and

crushed it, and I have been able to go neither forward nor
back .

”

Then I came up .
How do you do, Mr. Neville ?

” I

said ;
do you remember me

KING SOLOMON

’S MINES .
27 1

Why,

” b e said,

“ isn

’t it Quatermain , eh , and Good, too ?

Hold
on a minute, you fellows, I am getting dizzy again .

It is all so very strange, and, when a man has ceased to hope

,

SO very happy .

”

That evening, over the camp

-ﬁr e, George Curtis told us

his story, which, in its way, was almost as eventful as ou r

own, and amounted, Shortly, to this . A little short of two
years before, he had started from Sitanda

’s Kraal , to try

and reach the mountains.
As for the note I had sent him

by Jim, that worthy had lost it, and he had never heard of
it till to

-day . But, acting upon information he had received

from the natives, he made, not for Sheba

’s breasts , but for

the ladder

-like descent
of the mountains down which we

had just come, which was clearly a better route than that
marked
ou t in
Old Don Silvestra

’splan .
In the desert he

and Jim suffered great hardships, but ﬁnally they reached
this oasis, where a terrible accident befell George Curtis.
On the day
of their arrival he was sitting by the stream,

and Jim was extracting the honey from the nest of a sting
less bee, which is to be found in the desert, on the top of
the bank immediately above him . In so doing he loosed a
great boulder of rock, which fell upon George Curtis

’s right

leg , crushing it frightfully .
From that day he had been SO

dreadfully lame that he had found it impossible to go either
forward or back, and had preferred to take the chances of

dying on the oasis to the certainty of perishing in the desert .

As for food , however, they had got on pretty well, for

they had a good supply of ammunition , and the oasis was
frequented, especially at night, by large quantities of game,
which came thither for water .
These they shot, or trapped

in pitfalls, using their ﬂesh for food and, after their clothes

Wore out, their hides for covering .

272
KING SOLOMON

‘ S MINE S .

And so,

” he ended,
we have lived for nearly two years,

like a second Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday, hoping
against hOpe that some natives might come here and help
us away, but none have come .
Only last night we settled

that Jim should leave me and try to reach Sitanda

’sKraal

and get assistance.
He was to go to

-morrow, but I had

little hOpe Of ever seeing him back again .
And now you ,

of all the people in the world, you who I fancied had long
ago forgotten all about me , and were living comfortably
in Old England, turn up in a promiscuous way and ﬁnd me
where you least expected.
It is the most wonderful thing

I ever heard of, and the most merciful, too .”

Then Sir Henry set to work and told him the main facts

Of our adventures, sitting till late into the night to do it.

“ By Jove
he said, when I showed him some
of the

diamonds ;
well, at least you have got something for your

pains, besides my worthless self.

”

Sir Henry laughed .

“ They belong to Quatermain and

Good .
It was part of the bargain that they should share

any Spoils there might be .

This remark set me thinking, and, having Spoken to Good,

I told Sir Henry that it was ou r unanimous wish that he
should take a third share of the diam onds, or , if he would
not, that his share should be handed to his brother, who had
suffered even more than ourselves On the chance of getting
them .
Finally, we prevailed upon him to consent to this

arrangement, but George Curtis did not know
of it till

some time afterwards .

And here, at this point, I think I shall end this history.

Our journey across the desert back to Sitanda

’sKraal was

most arduous, especially as we had to support George Cur
