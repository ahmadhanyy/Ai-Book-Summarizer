Introduction

Rent Is Real

by Victoria Leacock Hoffman

"Rent is about a community celebrating life in the face of death and AIDS
at the turn of the century."

-Jonathan Larson

When Jonathan Larson started writing Rent, he was twenty-nine years old.
It was 1989 and he was living in a fourth-floor tenement walk-up on the
edge of SoHo in downtown Manhattan.

People were dying.

AIDS seemed to be everywhere, and in New York City it was.

Jonathan's living room overlooked a garbage depot. Sitting at his desk, a

distressed drafting table, in his sagging director's chair, he would devote
almost seven years to creating his rock-musical Rent.

I had first met Jonathan Larson at Adelphi University in 1981, during a

rehearsal for the senior-class production of Godspell. He was portraying
Jesus and was being crucified. Since the musical was being done with a
"circus motif," he was being suspended above the stage by two gymnastic
rings. It is hard to sing and act when you are hanging from your arms, and
although I would soon discover Jonathan's brilliance, at that moment he was
struggling. I was a freshman theatre major and had been assigned to focus
lights for the production. But I was focusing on Jonathan. I had heard about
the star of the senior show, how he had received a full four-year acting
scholarship and that he was also a great composer. And I liked what I saw,
his dark tussled hair and long limbs, and his impassioned performance,
despite the obvious physical discomfort, was arresting. Just a few months
earlier, there had been assassination attempts against Pope John Paul II and

President Reagan, and the first anniversary of John Lennon's murder was
approaching; the world seemed an uncertain place. As I watched Jonathan
sing his heart out, I knew the world was a better place with him in it. I also
knew that he'd be my first love, which he was. What I didn't know was that
we would become best friends and close collaborators for the next fifteen
years.

In 1982, when Jonathan graduated and moved to Manhattan, he intended

to be an actor. He had started to go to open casting calls for plays and
musicals, but found his leading-man talent was being thwarted by his tall
"character actor" looks. He had started a correspondence with Stephen
Sondheim when he was in college, and after his first frustrating year in New
York, he wrote to his mentor and asked if he thought he should pursue being
a composer. Having critiqued some of Jonathan's music, the answer would
change his life, for Sondheim told him, "I know a lot fewer starving
composers then I do actors." Jonathan took the advice to mean that he was
talented enough as a composer to try.

That same year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave a

name to a new illness-AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). In
New York, in the artistic community, there were whispers of a growing
number of young gay men becoming ill and dying of rare cancers. Jonathan
and I and our friends, some of whom were gay, started paying attention, but
it was like seeing something out of the corner of your eye-we were aware of
it, but until it was better defined and we knew what to do about it, we were
absorbed in trying to pay our rent and forge our careers. AIDS, like auto
accidents and plane crashes, was something you heard about, but only in
terms of someone else: someone you didn't know.

Jonathan threw himself into writing musicals that he hoped and believed

would save Broadway from itself. He had grown up in Westchester, just
north of New York City, where his parents brought him and his sister, Julie,
to see West Side Story, Gypsy, Hair, and Jesus Christ Superstar. But he was
dismayed at what he now saw as the pandering of Broadway to busloads of
lunching blue-haired ladies. The shows he had been raised on had been
replaced by pyrotechnic spectacles and whiskery costumes. He believed

theatre should be transcendent, with the power to change your life. And he
believed he was the man to do it.

To this end, he waited tables at Hamburger Harry's, in the theatre district,

where he met and began dating Brenda Daniels, fellow waitperson and
modern dancer. She was tall, with short, spiky hair, and had tremendous
talent. She was teaching at the Merce Cunningham Studio and was well
aware of the threat that was enveloping her community of dancers: HIV, the
human immunodeficiency virus, had been identified as the virus that causes
AIDS. And it was tearing through the lives of the dance company, like it
would in the fashion, nightclub, theatre, and film communities. Rock
Hudson, a very handsome matinee idol of Jon's mother's generation, had
shocked much of the nation when shortly before he died he disclosed he had
AIDS. His ravaged appearance underscored the viciousness of the illness.

Throughout the mid-eighties, as the hole in the ozone layer grew,

celebrities were trying to heal the world's ills with the pop songs "Do They
Know It's Christmas" and "We Are the World." In New York City, crack
cocaine had started to work its way into the lives of the vulnerable, and the
homeless population was exploding, with almost 25,000 people living on
the streets and in the shelter system. Jonathan, who subscribed to the New
York Times no matter how poor he was, absorbed these facts and saw many
of them outside his window while living with two roommates, two cats and
working his three shifts a week, now at the Moondance Diner. He spent the
rest of his time, writing a musical version of George Orwell's 1984 that he'd
been unable to secure the rights for, and Superbia, a futuristic allegory
about bottom-line mentality in an orbiting studio where everyone lives on
and for the camera. Both musicals were set in a world where Big Brother
greed and lust for power supersedes the individual's hopes and dreams.

The heroes Jonathan created kept trying to restore those hopes and

dreams. And in pursuit of his own, he had developed good relationships
with ASCAP and the Dramatists Guild, being invited to workshop his
material.

But in 1986, nothing he could have imagined would have prepared him

for the news that his childhood best friend, Matt O'Grady, was about to tell
him when he arrived at the Moondance Diner and ordered a milk shake.

Best friends since they were six, they had played on their tree-lined street
and swum in the neighbors' pools. Matt's welcoming Irish Catholic family
blended seamlessly with the liberal Jewish Larsons, and theirs were,
perhaps, the only two families in White Plains to vote for George
McGovern in 1972. They went to school together, and in high school, when
Matt realized he was gay, the first person he told was Jonathan. Jon never
judged, he listened and cared. So that day, when Matt settled in at the
counter at the Moondance, as he often did for a visit with Jon, all seemed
well. But Matt had news; he was HIV positive. For Jon, in that moment,
HIV had gone from being in articles in the New York Times and the
wrenching stories of friends' friends wasting away and dying from AIDS to
looking into his best friend's eyes and praying that Matt would somehow
survive. It was an apocalyptic disease. For the 28,712 people in the United
States who had progressed from being HIV positive to having AIDS by
1986, 24,559 had died by year's end. Matt's diagnosis had a profound
impact on Jonathan's life. It would accelerate everything, because, I believe,
it started an invisible stopwatch. Time could run out.

By 1989, a year after Libyan terrorists had brought down Pan Am Flight

103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and medical waste had started washing up on
the beaches of Long Island, people were listening to Bobby McFerrin's
"Don't Worry, Be Happy" and trying the antidepressant Prozac. Jonathan
had won several prestigious awards and grants for Superbia, but with each
new draft, his hero's and heroine's outcomes diminished. In a late draft, his
heroine chooses to electrocute herself by touching the wires inside her MT
(media transmitter) and the hero decides not to save the world. Jon was
frustrated with the progress of his career. He was about to turn thirty, was in
a committed relationship with another beautiful dancer, Janet Charleston,
and was still waiting tables at the Moondance Diner. And though, to
Jonathan's relief, Matt O'Grady was doing well and his HIV had not
progressed to AIDS, the number of reported AIDS cases had quadrupled to
117,508. One of those new cases was our good friend Alison Gertz. Ali's
diagnosis and the discovery that she had become infected when she was
sixteen from a single sexual encounter with a boyfriend became
international news. At twenty-two she became the new face of AIDS. It was
the year the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil onto the
shores of Alaska and hundreds, if not thousands, of young people were

killed during student protests in China's Tiananmen Square. Jon needed to
say something, and though he had written many political cabarets for
Adelphi University, he was anxious to start work on a new show that would
create a platform for the many social issues that troubled him.

That summer, Ira Weitzman, the musical theatre program director of

Playwrights Horizons (the nonprofit theatre where Sondheim would
develop many of his shows and Jonathan had received a workshop of
Superbia), recommended Jonathan to playwright Billy Aronson, who was
interested in creating a modern musical based on Puccini's La Boheme.
After listening to some of Jonathan's music, they agreed to meet.

Billy arrived at Jon's place on Greenwich Street shortly before dusk.

Since there was no doorbell, he called from the pay phone on the corner and
Jon threw down the keys. Billy made his way through the smudged halls, up
the three flights of rickety stairs to meet Jon in his kitchen, which had a
large four-legged bathtub in the center of it. They got some lemonade and
seltzer and climbed a steep ladder to the roof. Overlooking the Hudson
River, as the lights of the prison barge appeared (New York had run out of
space for its more violent offenders), Billy, sitting on a crate, shared his
own frustrations and fears about the arts and theatre and life.

They agreed to work together and eventually wrote first drafts of the

songs "Rent," "Santa Fe," and "I Should Tell You." They were both excited
by the feel of the pieces and the vibrancy of the music. Jon suggested the
title Rent and reminded Billy of its other definition: to tear apart with force
or violence, an apt metaphor for the turmoil in the community they were
describing. From that first meeting, Jon had strong ideas about many
aspects of the show that exist in its final form, from the East Village
location to the drug addiction of Mimi, and most importantly, that she lives.
He felt very strongly that the show was about celebrating life. And as he
and Billy continued to work into November, when the Berlin Wall fell and
trumpeted the beginning of the end of the Cold War, it seemed that there
may well be things to celebrate. The reinventing of a great classic like
Puccini's La Boheme, based on Henri Murger's book Scenes de la Vie
Boheme, with tuberculoses in Paris in the 1800s being replaced with AIDS
in New York City at the end of the twentieth century, was the canvas Jon's

creativity had been longing for. But as Billy and he continued to try to work
through the story, with both of them new to collaborating, they found their
essentially different writing styles were at odds. After a few months of
working together, they recorded a demo of the first three songs and decided
to pursue different projects individually.

There was another reason that Jon took a step away from Rent. He was

anxious about creating another large-scale musical that producers would
shy away from. For five years, including that past September with a well-
attended concert version at the Village Gate, he had heard that Superbia,
with its large cast and futuristic sets, would be dauntingly expensive to
produce. Jonathan wanted to pare down his next show. The New Year
arrived, and his thirtieth birthday was celebrated with a surprise party I
threw at our friend Pam Shaw's landlady's West Village brownstone (what
we couldn't provide ourselves, we borrowed!). Though Matt and many of
his closest friends attended, our friend Gordon couldn't. He had been
admitted to the hospital that week. At 6 feet 7 inches, the usually robust and
stylish Gordon, who had worked on the costumes for the recent Superbia
concert, was on a respirator, being fed through a tube in his nose, and was
paralyzed from the neck down. He had a rare ailment unusual in a healthy
twenty-eight-year-old, so the doctors asked him to take an HIV test. By the
time they informed him that he had full-blown AIDS two weeks later, he
was a skeletal 127 pounds. He was unable to speak for the first three
months of his diagnosis. He was one of the 160,969 cases of AIDS reported
in the United States by the end of 1990.

Jonathan, who was very emotionally connected to his friends and

surroundings, set to work on a new form of musical, a "rock monologue"
that he would perform himself with a four-piece band. He had been inspired
by the personal and political monologues of Eric Bogosian and Spalding
Gray and the performance pieces of Laurie Anderson. He would write a
multi-titled piece he would eventually call tick, tick ... BOOM! that would
tell the very semiautobiographical story of a composer named Jonathan
during the week of his thirtieth birthday, exploring his fear that he would
never fulfill his dream of "being the future of the American musical" and
examining how his life changes when he learns that his best friend is HIV

positive. Ultimately, the character Jonathan is empowered to try to change
the world through his writing.

Jon and I staged a small production of tick, tick ... BOOM! at the Second

Stage Theatre and several workshops for a young producer named Jeffrey
Seller, but we were finding it as difficult to get a theatrical production for
this much leaner show as we'd had with Superbia. In a last-ditch attempt,
we hoped to launch a successful ongoing run at the Village Gate in
November 1991. We had raised some money (much of it our own) and were
paying a band to perform with Jonathan. On a cold Wednesday night, I
arrived at the Night Owl Studios on West 30th Street during the first, and
only, full-band rehearsal with Jonathan and our director, Pippin Parker. I
avoided eye contact with Jonathan and called Pippin out of the room. I was
weak and distressed and didn't know what to do; Pamela Shaw, whom I had
known since I was six and Jon had dated, had just found out that she had
AIDS. We could hear Jon singing through the studio door. He sounded
amazing as he sang a wrenching version of "Why," about his friendship
with Matt. Pippin and I agreed that I should not tell him until after opening
night. This was not only shocking news but meant that Jonathan had been
exposed to the virus and needed to be tested himself.

The opening was well attended and Jon was glad to be performing again.

After a celebratory late-night dinner, I walked him back to the edge of
SoHo and joined him for what he thought would be a nightcap to discuss
the evening's events. I told Jon to sit down.

I told him that Pam had been tested for HIV because of a minor infection

in her mouth. I told him that she was HIV positive, and though she
appeared perfectly healthy, she had six of the 1,000- plus T cells per
microliter that a healthy person has and essentially had no immune system,
and therefore she had AIDS. I told him that he needed to be tested. Jonathan
was speechless. He was truly shaken by Pam's diagnosis and as frightened
as anyone would be to find out that they have been exposed to the deadly
virus. In a few weeks, he was relieved to find out he was HIV negative, but
it was no time to celebrate. The grim reality that four of our best friends
were infected with HIV, and three of them had developed AIDS, changed
everything in our lives. Jon hosted a peasants feast every year-a giant

potluck holiday meal for his artist friends and extended family-and that year
each toast filled our eyes with tears.

That fall, Jonathan asked Billy Aronson for permission to proceed with

Rent on his own. Permission was granted. And from that time on, Jon threw
himself into Rent, a canvas large enough to honor his friends and to raise
awareness about AIDS and the social injustices he saw every day. As he
would proclaim in his song "La Vie Boheme," "the opposite of war isn't
peace, it's creation."

That is what Jonathan did, he created Rent, and everything he felt and

feared and celebrated is in this libretto. And it is filled with his love, too. In
the early hours of January 25, 1996, after the final dress rehearsal for Rent
at the New York Theatre Workshop in the East Village, elated and
exhausted, Jonathan made his way home. He died, alone in his apartment,
from a dissecting aortic aneurysm that doctors in two hospital emergency
rooms had failed to detect. He never knew that Rent would indeed change
the American musical theatre. But I know he would be proud that it did.

RENT

Act One

(The audience enters the theatre to discover the curtainless set. The one set
piece onstage, at stage left, is a huge tower that represents (a) a totem
pole/Christmas tree that stands in an abandoned lot, (b) a wood stove with a
snaky chimney that is at the center of MARK and ROGER's loft apartment,
and (c) the steeple of a church in ACT TWO. There is a wooden platform
loft area at stage right with a railing around it, under which sits the band of
five musicians. It has a staircase on the upstage side. Downstage is a black,
waist-high rail fence.)

(Onstage, once the house is open, CREW and BAND MEMBERS move
about informally in preparation for the play.)

(ROGER enters from upstage left with an electric guitar and crosses to a
guitar amp sitting on a chair at center stage. He casually plugs his guitar
into the amp and sets levels, then crosses downstage and sits on the table.)

(After a few beats, the COMPANY, led by MARK, enters from all
directions and fills the stage. MARK sets up a small tripod and a 16mm
movie camera downstage center, aimed upstage. He addresses the
audience.)

MARK

We begin on Christmas Eve, with me, Mark, and my roommate, Roger. We
live in an industrial loft on the corner of 11th Street and Avenue B, the top
floor of what was once a music publishing factory. Old rock 'n' roll posters
hang on the walls. They have Roger's picture advertising gigs at CBGB's
and the Pyramid Club. We have an illegal wood-burning stove; its exhaust
pipe crawls up to a skylight. All of our electrical appliances are plugged
into one thick extension cord, which snakes its way out a window. Outside,
a small tent city has sprung up in the lot next to our building. Inside, we are
freezing because we have no heat.

(HE turns the camera to ROGER.)

Any location and JOANNE's loft

MARK

Valentine's Day ... pan across the empty lot. Roger's down at Mimi's, where
he's been for almost two months now, although he keeps talking about
selling his guitar and heading out of town. (Still jealous of Benny) ... God
knows where Collins and Angel are.... Could be that new shantytown near
the river or a suite at the Plaza.... Maureen and Joanne are rehearsing.

JOANNE

I said-once more from the top!

MAUREEN

I said no!!

MARK

That is if they're still speaking this week.... Me? I'm here. Nowhere. (Lights
up on the scene.)

JOANNE

And the line is, "Cyberarts and it's corporate sponsor, Grey
Communications, would like to mitigate the Christmas Eve riots ..." What is
so difficult ... ?

MAUREEN

It just doesn't roll off my tongue. I like my version.

JOANNE

You-dressed as a groundhog-to protest the groundbreaking .. .

MAUREEN

It's a metaphor!

JOANNE

It's ... less than brilliant.

MAUREEN

That's it, Miss Ivy League!

JOANNE

What?

MAUREEN

Ever since New Year's, I haven't said boo. I let you direct. I didn't pierce my
nipples because it grossed you out. I didn't stay and dance at the Clit Club
that night 'cause you wanted to go home ...

JOANNE

You were flirting with the woman in rubber.

MAUREEN

That's what this is about? There will always be women in rubberflirting

choreographed around her. During the bridge of the song, ANGEL is

the end of the song, JOANNE and MAUREEN are reunited as are ROGER

In a church, ANGEL's memorial

MIMI

Angel was one of my closest friends. It's right that it's Halloween, because
it was her favorite holiday. I knew we'd hit it off the moment we met-that
skinhead was bothering her and she said she was more of a man than he'd
ever be and more of a woman than he'd ever get...

... and then there was the time he walked up to this group of tourists-and
they were petrified because (a)-they were obviously lost, and (b)-had
probably never spoken to a drag queen before in their lives ... and he ... she
just offered to escort them out of Alphabet City.... And then she let them
take a picture with herand then she said she'd help 'em find the Circle Line
...

MAUREEN

... so much more original than any of us-you'd find an old tablecloth on the
street and make a dress-and next year, sure enough-they'd be mass-
producing them at the Gap! You always said how lucky you were that we
were all friends-but it was us, baby, who were the lucky ones.
