EDITORS’ NOTE

The growing interest in Clausewitz’s theoretical, political and historical

writings in recent years suggested that the time had come for an entirely
new translation. We have based our work on the first edition of 1832,
supplemented by the annotated German text published by Professor Werner
Hahlweg in 1952, except where obscurities in the original edition—which
Clausewitz himself never reviewed—made it seem advisable to accept later
emendations.

In all but one respect we have followed the original arrangement of the

text. The first edition printed four notes by Clausewitz on his theories,
dating from various periods between 1816 and 1830, as introductions to On
War itself—a practice adopted by most subsequent German and foreign
editions. We have abandoned the haphazard arrangement in which these
have always appeared, and instead print them in the order in which we
believe the notes to have been written. Read consecutively they help to
indicate how On War took shape in Clausewitz’s mind, and suggest how it
might have further developed had he lived to complete it. We have also
included Marie von Clausewitz’s Preface to the first edition of Clausewitz’s
posthumous works, which adds information on the genesis of On War, and
on the manner in which the manuscript was prepared for publication. A
brief note she inserted at the beginning of the third volume of Clausewitz’s
Works, immediately preceding Book Seven of On War, has been deleted
since its primary concern is not with On War but with other historical and
theoretical writings.

We have attempted to present Clausewitz’s ideas as accurately as

possible, while remaining as close to his style and vocabulary as modem
English usage would permit. But we have not hesitated to translate the same
term in different ways if the context seemed to demand it. For instance, we
have translated Moral and moralische Kraft variously as “morale,” “moral,”
and “psychological.” Clausewitz himself was far from consistent in his
terminology, as might be expected of a writer who was less concerned with
establishing a formal system or doctrine than with achieving understanding
and clarity of expression. At times he writes Geisteskräfte, Seelenkräfte,
even Psychologie instead of moralische Kraft or moralische Grössen, and a
similar flexibility characterizes his use of such terms as “means,”
“purpose,” “engagement,” “battle,” etc. As he writes in Book Five, Chapter
Seven: “Strict adherence to terms would clearly result in little more than
pedantic distinctions.”

formerly of the British Foreign Office, who to the deep regret of his many
friends died while he was still engaged on the project. He had however
already done much valuable preliminary work, for which we are greatly in
his debt. We should like to thank Mrs. Elsbeth Lewin, editor of World
Politics, and Professor Bernard Brodie of the University of California at
Los Angeles for checking the manuscript and helping us resolve many
ambiguities, and Messrs. Herbert S. Bailey, Jr. and Lewis Bateman of
Princeton University Press for the care they took in preparing the
manuscript for publication. Financial assistance by the Center of
International Studies of Princeton University facilitated the early phases of
our work. Finally, it is a pleasure to express our gratitude to Professors
Klaus Knorr of Princeton University and Gordon Craig of Stanford
University, without whose interest and encouragement this task would
never have been undertaken.

NOTE FOR THE 1984 EDITION

 
We have corrected some errors and attempted to remove a few infelicities in
our translation of Clausewitz’s text. As in the past, however, we believe that
this work demands translators who combine a deep respect for the author
with the willingness to seek equivalents whenever too close a
correspondence with the original would lead to artificiality.

In the introductory essays, minor changes were made in “The Genesis of

War,” and two paragraphs on the Marxist interpretation of Clausewitz were
added to “The Influence of Clausewitz.” The only other change from our
original edition is the inclusion of an index, which Mrs. Rosalie West has
compiled on the model of the index in Professor Werner Hahlweg’s 1952,
1972, and 1980 German editions of On War.

PETER PARET

The presence of a few of his earliest ideas in On War suggests the con-

sequentiality with which his theories evolved, though in the mature work
these ideas appear as components of a dialectical process that Clausewitz
had mastered in the course of two decades and adapted to his own purposes.
An example is his concept of the role genius plays in war, which lies near
the source of his entire theoretical effort. Survivors of a somewhat different
kind are his definitions of strategy and tactics, which he first formulated
when he was twenty-four, or the characteristically unromantic comparison
of war to commercial transactions, dating from the same time. Most of his
early thoughts, however, expanded and acquired new facets in the years
between Napoleon’s defeat of Prussia and the Russian campaign.
Clausewitz was a member of the loose alliance of reform-minded civilians
and soldiers who attempted with some success to modernize Prussian
institutions at this time, and his manifold activities as staff officer,
administrator, and teacher further stimulated his intellectual interests and
his creativity. Numerous passages from memoranda, lectures, and essays
written during the reform era reappear, barely changed, in On War. After
1815, by which time his manuscripts on politics, history, philosophy,

strategy, and tactics ran into thousands of pages, Clausewitz set to work on
a collection of essays analyzing various aspects of war, which gradually
coalesced into a comprehensive theory that sought to define universal,
permanent elements in war on the basis of a realistic interpretation of the
present and the past. In the course of a decade, he wrote six of eight planned
parts, and drafted the remaining two. By 1827, however, he had developed a
new hypothesis on what he called the “dual” nature of war, the systematic
exploration of which demanded a far-reaching revision of the entire
manuscript. He died before he could rewrite more than the first chapters of
Book One.1

On War thus presents its author’s thoughts in various stages of

completion. They range from the magnificent opening sequence of logically
unfolding propositions to the rich but at times one-sided or contradictory
discussions of Books Two through Six, to the essayistic chapters of the last
two books, which suggest with brilliant strokes what a final version might
have contained. Nothing can take the place of this unwritten version; but we
should remember that Clausewitz’s decision in 1827 to revise his
manuscript had not implied a rejection of earlier theories—he only meant to
expand and refine them. As we read the present text of On War, we can at
least approximate Clausewitz’s intention by keeping his closely related
hypotheses of the dual nature of war and of its political character clearly in
mind. It will be useful, at the end of this discussion, to return to his ultimate
hypotheses and outline their most significant aspects, the more so since he
never fully developed their implications to theory.

That, despite the unevenness of its execution, On War offers an

essentially consistent theory of conflict is indicative of the creative power
of Clausewitz’s method and ideas. Anyone prepared to enter into his
manner of reasoning will grasp his thoughts on the timeless aspects of war.
But our reading of On War can only benefit from an awareness of its
genesis and intellectual context. What political and military experiences
influenced its author? What were the assumptions and theories he reacted
against? What, in his view, were the methodological requirements of sound
analysis? Even a brief consideration of these questions will cast light on the
development of Clausewitz’s ideas and on the forms his ideas assumed in
the various strata of On War.2

Prussian internal revenue service, first encountered war in 1793 as a twelve-
year-old lance corporal. In the previous year the French legislative
assembly had declared war on Austria, with whom Prussia had recently
concluded a defensive alliance. The French action was caused less by
considerations of national interest than by internal politics, but it opened
twenty-three years of conflict between revolutionary and later imperial
France and the rest of Europe. Aside from the Duke of Brunswick’s initial
invasion, which came to a halt at Valmy, the Prussians did reasonably well
in a war to which they never committed more than part of their military
resources. They defeated the French repeatedly in Alsace and the Saar, and
captured thousands of prisoners; when the fighting ended in 1795, they
controlled the line of the Rhine. But these achievements brought no
political returns. As might be expected, the war with its exertions,
bloodshed, and unspectacular outcome made a strong impression on the
young Clausewitz; he himself later wrote of its impact on his emotions and
thought. In the following years, while stationed in a small provincial
garrison, he drew some tentative conclusions from these early experiences,
three of which in particular were to have a lasting influence: There was no
single standard of excellence in war. The rhetoric and policies of the French
Republic, which proclaimed the coming of a new age, by no means
overpowered the armies of the ancien régime. Mercenaries and forcibly
enrolled peasants, led by officers whose effectiveness still rested as much
on aristocratic self-esteem as on professional expertise, proved a match for
the levée en masse. On the other hand, Prussian drill failed to sweep away
the revolutionary armies. As the Republic gained in stability and
experience, it would have much to teach its opponents, whose ability to
learn and to respond effectively remained in doubt. These events and his
first readings in history suggested to Clausewitz that no one system was
right to the exclusion of all others. Military institutions and the manner in
which they employed violence depended on the economic, social, and
political conditions of their respective states. Furthermore, political
structures, like wars, could not be measured by a single standard. States
were shaped by their particular past and present circumstances; very
different forms had validity, and all were subject to continuing change.

and military institutions was a second conclusion, which placed the young
officer in opposition to prevailing opinion in Prussia and, indeed, Europe.
He thought it was a mistake to believe that war could be mastered by
observing this or that set of rules. The variety and constant change in war
could never be fully caught by a system. Any dogmatic simplification—that
victory depended on the control of key points, for instance, or on the
disruption of the opponent’s lines of communication —only falsified reality.
Possibly Clausewitz already distrusted the conviction, held by most military
theorists of his day, that the scope of chance in war should and could be
reduced to a minimum by the employment of the correct operational and
tactical doctrine. For someone who passionately wanted to understand war
in a systematic and objectively verifiable manner it was particularly hard to
accept the power of chance; but by the time he was in his mid-twenties his
realism and the logic of his view of historical change had brought him to
the point of regarding chance not only as inevitable but even as a positive
element in war.

recognizing war as a political phenomenon. Wars, as everyone knew, were
fought for a purpose that was political, or at least always had political
consequences. Not as readily apparent was the implication that followed. If
war was meant to achieve a political purpose, everything that entered into
war—social and economic preparation, strategic planning, the conduct of
operations, the use of violence on all levels—should be determined by this
purpose, or at least accord with it. Even though soldiers had to acquire
special expertise, and function in what in some respects was a separate
world, it would be a denial of reality to allow them to carry on their bloody
work undisturbed until an armistice brought their political employer back
into the equation. Just as war and its institutions reflected their social
environment, so every aspect of fighting should be suffused by its political
impulse, whether this impulse was intense or moderate. The appropriate
relationship between politics and war occupied Clausewitz throughout his
life, but even his earliest manuscripts and letters show his awareness of
their interaction.

The ease with which this link—always acknowledged in the abstract—

can be forgotten in specific cases, and Clausewitz’s insistence that it must

never be overlooked, are illustrated by his polite rejection toward the end of
his life of a strategic problem set by the chief of the Prussian General Staff,
in which every military detail of the opposing sides was spelled out, but no
mention made of their political purpose. To a friend who had sent him the
problem for comment, Clausewitz replied that it was not possible to draft a
sensible plan of operations without indicating the political condition of the
states involved, and their relationship to each other: “War is not an
independent phenomenon, but the continuation of politics by different
means. Consequently, the main lines of every major strategic plan are
largely political in nature, and their political character increases the more
the plan applies to the entire campaign and to the whole state. A war plan
results directly from the political conditions of the two warring states, as
well as from their relations to third powers. A plan of campaign results
from the war plan, and frequently—if there is only one theater of operations
—may even be identical with it. But the political element even enters the
separate components of a campaign; rarely will it be without influence on
such major episodes of warfare as a battle, etc. According to this point of
view, there can be no question of a purely military evaluation of a great
strategic issue, nor of a purely military scheme to solve it.”3

In the second half of the 1790’s, the young Clausewitz had taken only the

first steps on the intellectual journey that was to lead to this conclusion; but,
as I suggested earlier, from the outset he traveled a straight road, with few
tangents or interruptions. The five years he spent as subaltern in the small
town of Neuruppin have commonly been dismissed as a time of stagnation,
but it seems that biographers have been too literal in their interpretation of a
characteristically critical and self-critical comment on the period that he
made years later. In reality his situation was not without advantages. Far
from serving in an undistinguished provincial unit, he belonged to a
regiment that had a member of the royal family, Prince Ferdinand, as
honorary colonel and patron. Near the town lay the residence of another
Hohenzollern, Prince Henry, Frederick the Great’s most gifted brother,
whose library, opera, and theater were open to the officer corps. Most
important, the regiment was known throughout the army for its innovative
educational policies, financed largely by the officers themselves. On its
return from France the regiment had organized a primary and trade school

for the children of the rank and file, and a more advanced school for its
cadets and ensigns, which also admitted sons of the local gentry. It is
probable though not certain that like other lieutenants, Clausewitz taught
classes in the latter institution; and there can be no doubt that his exposure
to a serious teaching program deepened the interest he already felt in
education. As a fifteen-year-old, he later wrote, he had been captivated by
the idea that the acquisition of knowledge could lead to human
perfectibility. Soon the goal of improving society reinforced that of self-
improvement, and his desire to learn was joined by concern with the
methodology of education. The ways in which abstractions might
accurately reflect and convey reality, the manner in which men can be
taught to understand the truth, and the ultimate purpose of education—
which, he held, consisted not in the transmission of technical expertise but
in the development of independent judgment—all came to be major
considerations in Clausewitz’s theoretical work.

In 1801 Clausewitz gained admission to the new War College that

Scharnhorst, recently transferred from the Hanoverian service, had
organized in Berlin. Clausewitz graduated at the head of the class in 1803,
and was appointed adjutant to a young prince, son of his former commander
Prince Ferdinand, an assignment that enabled him to remain in the capital,
in close contact with his teacher Scharnhorst. The impact that Scharnhorst
exerted on Clausewitz’s life and on the development of his ideas cannot be
emphasized enough. Scharnhorst was an exceptionally energetic, daring
soldier, as well as a scholar and a gifted politician—a harmonious
combination of seeming opposites that his favorite pupil was never to equal.
This is not the place to discuss his opinions on strategy, on conscription,
and on command- and staff-organization, which constituted a pragmatic
reconciliation of the old and the new; important for our purpose is the
intellectual independence with which he approached the fundamental
military issues of the age, as well as his sympathy with the aims of
humanistic education, and his conviction that the study of history must be at
the center of any advanced study of war. Clausewitz’s tentative attitudes on
military theory and on education were confirmed and guided further by
Scharnhorst, who also deepened Clausewitz’s awareness of the social forces
that determined the military style and energies of states. Scharnhorst, the
son of a free peasant who had risen to the rank of squadron sergeant-major,

had had a difficult career in the Hanoverian army, where he had been
repeatedly slighted in favor of well-connected noble comrades. The
experience did not turn him into a democrat, nor—having achieved
professional success, including a title of nobility—did he fall into facile
acceptance of privilege. What mattered to him was not the particular
structure of society or the form taken by its institutions, but the spirit that
animated them. To give a specific example, in the regimental school for
soldiers’ children at Neuruppin Clausewitz had witnessed something of the
humanitarian, paternalistic concern for the poor that was a pronounced
feature of the late Enlightenment in Prussia. Scharnhorst taught him that
this was adequate neither for the individual nor for the state. If the French
Revolution had proved anything, it was that states wishing to preserve their
independence must become more efficient in tapping the energies of their
populations. Elites existed in every society, and were justified so long as
they strengthened the community, remained open to talent, and rewarded
merit. But nothing could justify the continuation of privilege that protected
mediocrity while depriving the state of the abilities and enthusiasm of the
common man. It was this attitude that a few years later was to determine the
direction of the Prussian reform movement-less perhaps in civil matters
than on the military side under the leadership of Scharnhorst and his close
associates. In the genesis of Clausewitz’s ideas, the essentially un-
ideological view of social and political arrangements, which he had learned
in part from Scharnhorst and which he expressed as early as 1804 and 1805,
clearly parallels his undoctrinaire approach to war. Statesman and soldier
must shed tradition, convenience, any influence that interferes with their
achieving the major objective. Similarly, the theorist, wishing to understand
the nature of the state and the nature of war, must never allow his thoughts
to diverge far from the element central to each—power in politics, violence
in war.
  

of the nineteenth century was to come to terms intellectually and
institutionally with the new French way of warfare. Within one decade the
resources that France mobilized for war had risen to unprecedented levels.
The number of soldiers now available to her generals made possible
campaigns that accepted greater risks, brought about battle more frequently,

spread over more territory, and pursued political goals of greater magnitude
than had been feasible for the armies of the ancien régime. This new
technique was used by Napoleon with a brilliance that shocked as much as
did his ruthlessness. For most Germans it was difficult enough to
understand his system, which combined the gifts of an exceptional
individual with social, administrative, and psychological achievements of
the Revolution, which were necessarily alien to them. For theorists of any
nationality it was even more difficult to recognize Napoleonic strategy and
tactics as a historical phenomenon, inevitably subject to change, rather than
as the ultimate in war, a permanent standard of excellence for war past,
present, and future.

European military literature commented with considerable insight on

separate elements of this system, but, as Clausewitz saw early on, failed in
attempts at comprehensive analysis. The best work in this area was done by
the Prussian theorist Heinrich von Bülow and the Swiss-French staff officer
Antoine Jomini on whose writings Clausewitz sharpened his theoretical
skills in the years preceding and immediately following the Prussian
debacle of 1806. Bülow had grasped the value of such recent tactical
developments as skirmishing in large numbers, rapidity of movement, and
aimed fire; at the same time he discounted the effectiveness of battle in the
new age, regarded it as a “resort of despair,” and instead postulated a
strategic system of points of domination and angles of approach, whose
geometric patterns combined in a fantastic manner with his paeans on the
natural, unfettered fighting man. In his first published work, a long essay on
Bülow, Clausewitz acknowledged the usefulness of some of his
terminology, as he was to find merit in some of Jomini’s concepts, but
pointed out that his method of analysis was flawed and that its conclusions
were unrealistic. In his urge to rationalize war, turn it into a science, and
make it predictive, Bülow attributed dominant roles to geographic features
and the appropriate arrangement of the supply system, while largely
ignoring the physical and psychological effects that might result from
unexpected movements of the opponent, from violence, from the fortuitous.
Strategy, Clausewitz objected, comprises “not only the forces that are
susceptible to mathematical analysis; no, the realm of the military art

extends wherever in psychology our intelligence discovers a resource that
can serve the soldier.”4

Jomini came closer to contemporary reality, but erred, Clausewitz

thought, in taking one part of war—major armies seeking a decisive victory
—for the whole. His claim that he had distilled general principles of war
from the operations of Napoleon, and from supposedly similar, though
inferior, operations of Frederick, Clausewitz dismissed as absurd. He wrote
in 1808 that Jomini’s principles would lose their absolute validity if it could
be shown that earlier generations had good reasons to ignore them. Caesar
or Eugene of Savoy, responding to the social, technological, and political
realities of their times, were not inferior to Napoleon because they did not
fight in a manner that the French Revolution had made possible. And just as
the past could be understood only in its own terms, men, too, must be
interpreted as individuals, not as abstractions. Jomini had unrealistically
imposed one rational standard of behavior on men with such different
personalities as Frederick and Napoleon, and besides had ignored the
differences in their experiences, to which each naturally reacted in his own
way.5

If the present did not provide the ideal against which war in the past

could be measured, Clausewitz was equally insistent that Napoleonic war
could not establish standards for the future.6 What did this mean for theory?
To Clausewitz the answer was obvious: The theory of any activity, even if it
aimed at effective performance rather than comprehensive understanding,
must discover the essential, timeless elements of this activity, and
distinguish them from its temporary features. Violence and political impact
were two of the permanent characteristics of war. Another was the free play
of human intelligence, will, and emotions. These were the forces that
dominated the chaos of warfare, not such schematic devices as Bülow’s
base of operations or Jomini’s operating on interior lines.

There was nothing new about stressing the significance of psychological

factors in war. But even those writers who attributed predominance to the
emotions had little of substance to say about them; discussions of courage,
fear, and morale figure only on the margin of the works of Maurice de Saxe
or Henry Lloyd. By contrast the young Clausewitz placed the psychological
at the center of his theoretical speculations. But since psychology was still a

rudimentary discipline that offered him few of the taxonomic and
interpretive tools he needed, he did so in a manner that modern readers may
find puzzling: he subsumed a large part of his interpretation of emotional
and moral characteristics under the concept of genius. It is essential to
understand that by genius Clausewitz meant not only originality and
creativity raised to their highest power but also, as he wrote in On War, gifts
of mind and temperament in general. Genius served as his favorite analytic
device to conceptualize the various abilities and feelings that affected the
behavior of more ordinary as well as of exceptional men.

inadequacy of prescriptive systems when faced with the infinite resources
of the mind and spirit. In his essay on Bülow he wrote that there must be no
conflict between common sense and sound theory since sound theory rested
on common sense and genius, or gave them expression.7 He was to hold
fast to this thought; it occurs repeatedly in On War, not only in the chapter
“On Military Genius,” but elsewhere as well, for example in the chapter
“On the Theory of War,” where characteristically it is linked to a sarcastic
attack on the surrender of such system-builders as Bülow and Jomini before
the unpredictable riches of the spirit: “Anything that could not be reached
by the meager wisdom of one-sided points of view was held to be beyond
scientific control: it lay in the realm of genius, which rises above all rules.
Pity the soldier who is supposed to crawl among these scraps of rules,
which are not good enough for genius, which genius can ignore or laugh at.
No; what genius does is the best rule, and theory can do no better than show
how and why this should be the case. Pity the theory that conflicts with
reason!”8 Theory and its resultant doctrines are thus subordinate to the great
creative talent, and to the universals of reason and feeling that it expresses.

Clausewitz himself was still far from formulating a theory that explained

why and how the action of genius should be the finest rule. He needed to
develop additional analytic devices before he could advance appreciably,
and it might be added that he never fully overcame the difficulties inherent
in the dual role that he ascribed to the concept of genius. The problems of
theory, however, were not identical with the problems of historical
understanding; here attention to the emotions of individuals and groups
combined readily with belief in the particularity of past epochs.

Clausewitz’s history of Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years War, written
about 1805, constitutes his initial effort to integrate these two interpretive
principles on a large scale.9 It was a remarkably successful attempt, and
only the first of many historical studies he was to write in the course of his
life. Indeed, if quantity is the measure, Clausewitz was more of a historian
than a theorist. That he was innovative in this discipline, too, tends to be
forgotten—possibly because his most original historical writings were not
published for decades, and because German historical scholarship soon
developed and expanded the vein which he had been among the first to
work, while as a theorist he remained without true successors. For a man of
his time, he took an unusually straightforward approach to the past. He did
not hide an ironic interest in the passions and limitations of his characters,
especially when writing about recent events; but he rarely showed
ideological or patriotic prejudice. As well as he could, he tried to discover
how and why things happened as they did. His urge to be objective was
intensified by his belief, based on personal predilection and Scharnhorst’s
teaching, that military theory in a variety of ways was dependent on history.
His mature conclusions on their appropriate relationship are best discussed
when we come to the writing of On War.
  

The defeat of Prussia in 1806 confirmed Clausewitz in his view that war

could not be considered in isolation, as an essentially military act. It was
obvious to him that the politics of the previous decade had largely decided
the issue before fighting began, while social conditions of long standing in
the Prussian monarchy had created military institutions and attitudes that
proved helpless against an opponent who was numerically superior and
attuned to the new forms of fighting. For Clausewitz personally the
campaign was once more an infantryman’s war; he served with a grenadier
battalion until his unit was compelled to surrender. After internment in
France and a sojourn in Switzerland he returned to Prussia in the spring of
1808. For the next four years he acted as confidential assistant to his former
teacher Scharnhorst, who employed him in a variety of assignments related
to the modernization of the army: reorganizing and reequipping the troops,
drafting new tactical and operational instructions, disseminating the new
doctrine as teacher at the War College and military tutor to the crown

prince. Finally, Clausewitz played a larger part than might be expected of a
junior officer in the evolution of the political and strategic thinking of the
reform party. The practical experience he acquired was unusually broad,
and further strengthened the pragmatic note that ran through his theoretical
as well as his historical writings. During these years he married. His wife, a
sophisticated, intelligent woman, shared his literary and philosophic
interests, and fully supported his growing political and professional
independence; only the lack of children marred an otherwise exceptionally
happy marriage. He also formed a lasting friendship with the second leader
of the military reformers, Gneisenau, a relationship that was to shape much
of his subsequent career. After Prussia was forced to contribute a corps to
the army that Napoleon was assembling for the invasion of Russia he
resigned his commission, and in the spring of 1812 accepted a staff
appointment in the Russian army.

active years is astonishing. To outline only the major hypotheses that
Clausewitz advanced in fields as seemingly diverse as grand strategy and
national character would take up more space than is possible here; but even
a brief introduction ought not to ignore the conclusions he reached on the
nature and function of military theory, since they were to determine the
approach he followed in On War. Something must also be said about the
analytic method he was developing. Finally, his many advances in the
content of theory can at least be suggested by discussing one representative
conceptualization of this period—the concept of friction, with which he
complemented earlier ideas and made them productive in scientific enquiry.

By 1808 Clausewitz firmly distinguished between the utilitarian,

pedagogic, and cognitive functions of theory. The first—improving the
soldier’s effectiveness—was the major, often the only, aim of contemporary
military theorists. Clausewitz shared their wish to define and respond to the
practical issues of modern war, and never more so than in the years when he
was passionately involved in rebuilding the Prussian army for the inevitable
second contest with Napoleon. But on grounds of logic as well as realism
he grew skeptical about the direct link between theory and performance that
military theorists took for granted. His study of Kantian philosophy before
1806 gave him at least some of the intellectual tools he needed to resolve
his doubts—his most significant borrowings being the view of theory held

by late-Enlightenment writers on aesthetics, and their concepts of “means”
and “purpose,” which came to play a pervasive role in On War. An essay
“Art and Theory of Art” illustrates his use of aesthetics to explore the
violent art of defeating one’s enemies. “Art,” he wrote, “is a developed
capacity. If it is to express itself it must have a purpose, like every
application of existing forces, and to approach this purpose it is necessary to
have means.... To combine purpose and means is to create. Art is the
capacity to create; the theory of art teaches this combination [of purpose
and means] to the extent that concepts can do so. Thus, we may say: theory
is the representation of art by way of concepts. We can easily see that this
constitutes the whole of art, with two exceptions: talent, which is
fundamental to everything, and practice”—neither of which can be the
product of theory.10 In short, even the most realistic theory could never
match reality. It followed that all attempts to establish rules with
prescriptive power were pointless in an activity such as fighting, and that
military theory could never be immediately utilitarian. As Clausewitz wrote
in the same essay, “rules are not intended for individual cases, and action in
the individual case can be determined only by [applying the concepts of]
purpose and means.“11 All that theory could do was to give the artist or
soldier points of reference and standards of evaluation in specific areas of
action, with the ultimate purpose not of telling him how to act but of
developing his judgment.

It was this process of refining the judgment and “instinctive tact” of the

acting individual that constituted the pedagogic function of theory, not
drawing up rules to be learned by rote. (Another pedagogic aspect of theory,
important to Clausewitz personally, had to do with the creative process. By
developing an analytic framework for war, Clausewitz strengthened his
intellectual capacities and implemented the program of self-education from
which he had not swerved since adolescence.) But although only serious
speculative inquiry could set the mind free, Clausewitz believed that most
men were neither capable of achieving intellectual mastery over complex
areas of human activity nor much interested in it. To help them through the
confusion of war they demanded relatively firm guides. How were these to
be provided? According to Clausewitz, experience went a long way, but in

the end appropriate guides for conduct could only grow out of a
comprehensive and scientific analysis.

solely with gaining a deeper understanding, might bring about
improvements in operational and strategic performance. But for Clausewitz
scientific inquiry needed no justification. While he never lost interest in the
military here and now, understanding as such was what eventually mattered
most to him, and it was to this task that On War addressed itself.

When Clausewitz first began to think of writing a study that would

explore the whole of war, not merely some of its parts, he chose as
intellectual models such books as Montesquieu’s De l’Esprit des lois and
Kant’s Critique of Practical Reason. If in its final version On War bore little
resemblance to these works, they nevertheless indicate something about the
method employed by its author. Earlier I characterized this method as
dialectical. It was that, but in a special sense. Certainly, he did not proceed
in a formal, highly structured manner. Hegel’s thesis, antithesis, synthesis,
to mention an approach that has often been read into On War, would have
seemed inappropriate to Clausewitz, as did any system, the logical and
intellectual symmetry of which were achieved at the expense of reality. But
he frequently did develop his ideas in what may be called a modified form
of thesis and antithesis, which permitted him to explore the specific
characteristics of a particular phenomenon with a high degree of exactitude.
Purpose and means, strategy and tactics, theory and reality, intent and
execution, friend and enemy—these are some of the opposites he defines
and compares not only to gain a truer understanding of each member of the
pair but also to trace the dynamic links that connect all elements of war into
a state of permanent interaction. One of the striking features of this way of
thinking is that it defines each element as sharply as possible while insisting
on the absence of discrete limits. War and politics, attack and defense,
intelligence and courage—to mention some additional pairings—are never
absolute opposites; rather one flows into the other.

assumptions of the natural sciences, provided Clausewitz with a
fundamental attitude and with the intellectual tools to express it. Belief in
the need to ascertain the essence of each phenomenon, or its regulative idea
—as violence, according to Clausewitz, was the essential idea of the

phenomenon “war”—combined with a universal view and with the sense
that small details contained the key to large forces, as knowledge of one
flower was basic to the understanding of nature, or knowing why and how a
man fought was essential to understanding war.

personal tendencies that Clausewitz eschewed generalization and
simultaneously rejected the anarchy of pure pragmatism. His aim was to
achieve a logical structuring of reality. He believed this could be done if the
search for regulative ideas and their elaboration were informed and
controlled by the theorist’s respect for present and past reality.
Consequently, his method consisted in a permanent discourse between
observation, historical interpretation, and speculative reasoning. As the
analysis proceeds it tries to take account of every element of war in its
present and past dimensions, accommodate itself to all, integrate all, and
never emphasize one to the exclusion of others. We will see that this
characteristic also holds true of the resulting theory, which floats,
Clausewitz said, between the major phenomena of war, without stressing
any one in particular. The dangers of exaggeration, of being blinded by
contemporary conditions, let alone of one-sided advocacy, are thus largely
avoided.

An example of the way in which Clausewitz’s method transformed

reality into analyzable form is provided by his development of the concept
of friction. He first used the term during the campaign of 1806 to describe
the difficulties Scharnhorst encountered in persuading the high command to
reach decisions, and the further difficulties of having the decisions
implemented. Uncertainty, ignorance, confusion, fatigue, error, countless
other imponderables—all interfered with the effective application of force.
During the reform era Clausewitz expanded the concept, and linked it with
other ideas, until by 1812 he had fully grasped its theoretical implications.
An essay he addressed to the crown prince at the end of his tutorials
concluded with a section on friction, which both in content and wording
became the basis for the chapter “Friction in War” in On War, and for the
discussion of friction that runs through the entire work.12 Waging war is
very difficult, he wrote, “but the difficulty is not that erudition and great
talent are needed ... there is no great art to devising a good plan of

operations. The entire difficulty lies in this: To remain faithful in action to
the principles, we have laid down for ourselves.”

conduct of war resembles the workings of an intricate machine with
tremendous friction, so that combinations which are easily planned on paper
can be executed only with great effort. Consequently the commander’s free
will and intelligence find themselves hampered at every turn, and
remarkable strength of mind and spirit are needed to overcome this
resistance. Even then many good ideas are destroyed by friction, and we
must carry out more simply and modestly what in more complicated form
would have given greater results.”

weather, for instance, or hunger—always has a psychologically inhibiting
effect; psychic energy must therefore take a part in overcoming it: “In
action our physical images and perceptions are more vivid than the
impressions we gained beforehand by mature reflection. But they are only
the outward appearances of things, which, as we know, rarely match their
essence precisely. We therefore run the risk of sacrificing mature reflection
to first impressions.” In the face of these pressures, men must hold to their
convictions and retain confidence in their knowledge and judgment;
otherwise they will succumb to the force of friction. Friction, he was to
conclude in On War, is the only notion that more or less comprises those
matters that distinguish the real war from war on paper.13

By creating the concept of friction he rendered one of the most important

elements in his image of war—chance—subject to theoretical analysis.
Insofar as friction interfered with one’s own actions, it stood only for the
negative aspects of chance. The positive aspects of chance were represented
by the equally pervasive force of friction on the enemy’s side. To appreciate
the significance of this development we must recall that the military writers
of the Enlightenment, while often acknowledging the power of the
fortuitous, did their best to reduce the scope of chance. Their spiritual
successors Bülow and Jomini strove for the same goal by means of systems
that extended the enormously detailed rules of eighteenth-century march,
camp, and tactical arrangements to strategy. Success could be assured by
choosing “correct” techniques. Other writers claimed modern war to be

anarchic, susceptible only to empirical treatment. Scharnhorst, on the
contrary, held that the natural behavior of societies and individuals in war
could be understood and thus to some extent guided, and Clausewitz gave
this belief theoretical form. In their view, to exclude or deny chance was to
go against nature; indeed, chance was to be welcomed because it was part
of reality. It was not only a threat but also a positive force to be exploited.
Napoleon expressed this idea perfectly in his operational dictum: Engage
the enemy, and see what happens. The commander put himself in the way
of chance; the power at his disposal and his will to use it enabled him to
turn chance into a new reality.

genius. Thus the concept of friction came to form the counterpart in
external life to the result of Clausewitz’s earlier analyses of the inner life of
the individual. Observation and reflection had led him to elevate genius—
the harmonious combination of exceptional gifts, and by extension,
intellectual and emotional qualities in general—to a central position in his
conceptualization of war. The concepts of genius, friction, chance, in their
manifold interaction, now made it possible for the theorist to subject vast
areas of military realitv to logical, systematic analysis.
  

During the war of 1812 Clausewitz served as staff officer with several

Russian commands, his ignorance of the language limiting him to the role
of observer until the end of December, when he took part in talks between
Russian authorities and the commander of the Prussian corps in the Grande
Armée that led to the strategically and politically important separation of the
Prussian forces from French control. As the fighting moved west he devised
the plan for organizing the East Prussian militia, a further significant step in
the process of detaching Prussia from French dominance. In the spring
campaign of 1813, still in Russian uniform, he acted as adviser to
Scharnhorst and Gneisenau until the former’s death, and then became chief
of staff of a small international army that covered the Baltic flank of the
Allies. Though strict monarchists, including the king himself, continued to
resent his earlier refusal to follow official policy and fight for the French, he
eventually gained readmission to the Prussian service. During the Waterloo
campaign he served as chief of staff of one of the four corps making up the
Prussian field army, and fought at Ligny and Wavre, where his corps tied

down Grouchy’s superior force until the main French army was beyond
help. In 1816 he became chief of staff of Gneisenau’s new command, with
headquarters at Coblenz on the Rhine; two years later he was transferred to
Berlin as Superintendent of the War Academy. His new duties were neither
onerous nor particularly rewarding. Several times he sought to exchange the
army for diplomacy; but since his reformist politics made him unacceptable
to the court, he remained in his administrative position for twelve years, not
displeased, on balance, with the opportunity of giving much of his time to
study and writing.

campaigns against Napoleon, that Clausewitz returned seriously to
theoretical work. A note found in his papers, which his wife quotes in her
introduction to On War, indicates that while stationed in the Rhineland he
began writing brief essays on strategy, addressed to the expert.14 None of
these pieces seems to have survived; but we possess at least one preliminary
study from which Clausewitz hoped to distill the aphoristic essay he was
aiming for: “On Progression and Pause in Military Activity.” It provided the
basis for Chapter Sixteen in Book Three of On War, which in turn
elaborates one of the key arguments in the first chapter of the work: real
war falls short of the total violence that is its essence in theory because,
among other reasons, war does not consist in a single act or in a group of
simultaneous actions, but extends over time with periods of action and
inaction alternating. Another, much less significant, essay may have been
the discussion on army organization that is usually printed as an appendix in
German editions of On War. Its essential points can be found in Chapter
Five of Book Five.

These essays, concise as they are, do not match the extreme brevity of the

chapters in Montesquieu’s works, which, Clausewitz writes, served him as a
kind of general model at this time. Nor does the structure of his argument
resemble Montesquieu’s. But the character of De l’Esprit des lois, and the
personality of its author, indicate clearly enough the basis for Clausewitz’s
sense of affinity. The introduction, to mention one example, contains
sentences that Clausewitz himself might have written: “I ask for a favor that
I fear will not be granted—do not judge the labor of twenty years at a
moment’s notice; approve or reject the entire work, not a few of its

statements. If one wishes to seek the author’s intention, it can be discovered
only in the scheme of the work.” A subsequent passage in which
Montesquieu states that while writing he “knew neither rules nor
exceptions” can hardly be improved on as a description of Clausewitz’s
attitude to the study of war.15

The essays, each singling out a particular phenomenon or concept, had

the advantage of revealing the major features of each with great clarity, but
their inevitably fragmented analysis left Clausewitz dissatisfied. As he
added new sections and revised existing ones, the compressed aphoristic
character of his work gave way to fuller treatment, which responded to his
preference for the systematic development of ideas and the uniform
application of concepts on a broad range of phenomena. Coincidentally, an
expanded and more explicit analysis would be suitable, he felt, for a wider
audience than he had had originally in mind. The result was On War
essentially as we know it today, except for the limited revisions made from
1827 on.

Readers of this work and of the studies leading up to it may ask why

Clausewitz felt it necessary to assert repeatedly that violence is the essence
of war, and dismiss his reiteration as a pedantic insistence on the obvious.
But Clausewitz stressed the point not only because experience and the study
of the past had convinced him of its truth; he was also responding to the
surprisingly numerous theorists who continued to claim that wars could be
won by maneuver rather than bloodshed. What matters, in any case, are the
deductions he drew from the self-evident. When he was twenty-four he had
written that war must always be waged with the greatest possible amount of
energy—that only “the most decisive operations accord with the nature of
war.”16 Eight years later he instructed his pupil, the crown prince, that war
always demanded the fullest mobilization of resources, and their most
energetic exploitation.17 Here were specific implications derived from the
concept of absolute war, of war that ideally should be waged with the
extreme of violence—ideally, because the extreme of violence accorded
with its nature. If war was an act of force, Clausewitz could discern no
logical “internal” or self-imposed limits on the use of force. His insistence
on extremes during the Napoleonic era resulted, of course, not only from
logic but also from the historical situation. Between 1792 and 1815

exceptional effort and the willingness to take great risks were, in fact,
needed to preserve Europe’s independence, or to regain it. But even in the
years of greatest challenge Clausewitz recognized that the demand of
absolute or utmost violence, though logically valid, was rarely satisfied in
reality. Absolute war was a fiction, an abstraction that served to unify all
military phenomena and helped make their theoretical treatment possible. In
practice the use of force tended to be limited. The power of friction reduced
the abstract absolute to the modifications it assumed in reality. The major,
unrevised part of On War is dominated by the mutually clarifying
dialectical relationship between absolute and real war.

absolute? And, secondly, was it valid to deduce from the concept of the
absolute that all wars, whatever their cause and purpose, must be waged
with supreme effort? In 1804 Clausewitz already distinguished between
wars fought “to exterminate the opponent, to destroy his political
existence,” and wars waged to weaken the opponent sufficiently so that one
could “impose conditions [on him] at the peace conference.”18 Yet while
drawing this distinction, Clausewitz denied that limited aims justified a
limitation of effort. He argued that even if no more were intended than
compelling the opponent to agree to terms, his power and will to resist must
be broken. For political and social as well as for military reasons the
preferred way of bringing about victory was the shortest, most direct way,
and that meant using all possible force. In this view, as I have suggested,
experience buttressed the demands of logic. It was not difficult to believe
that from the first campaign of the Revolution to the wars of 1806 and 1809
France emerged victorious because her opponents would not exert
themselves to the utmost. And it was in part because contemporary reality
seemed to confirm that every war was a modification of the absolute and
that every war should be waged without restrictions being placed on the
rational application of force that these arguments retained what might be
called a formal supremacy in Clausewitz’s work even as he was coming to
appreciate that they were one-sided.

His essay on “Progression and Pause” indicates that by 1817 he was no

longer content to impute the modification of military activity wholly to the
force of friction. Because war consisted in a series of interactions between

opponents, it was proper both in logic and reality that not every minute
should pass at the highest pitch of effort and violence. Numerous hints in
Books One through Six of On War point in the same direction. By the
middle of the 1820’s Clausewitz fully recognized that the second type of
war in actuality—a war fought for limited goals—was not necessarily a
modification or corruption of the theoretical principle of absolute war. As
he stated in his “Notice” and in the last revision of Chapter One of Book
One, a second type of war existed that was as valid as absolute war, not
only in the field but also philosophically. Limited wars might be a
modification of the absolute, but need not be, if the purpose for which they
were waged was also limited. Violence continued to be the essence, the
regulative idea, even of limited wars fought for limited ends; but in such
cases the essence did not require its fullest possible expression. The concept
of absolute war had by no means become invalid, it continued to perform
decisive analytic functions; but it was now joined by the concept of limited
war.

The dual nature of war, as Clausewitz formulated it in the last years of his

life, is expressed in two pairs of possible conflicts, each defined according
to the purpose involved: War waged with the aim of completely defeating
the enemy, in order (1) to destroy him as a political organism, or (2) to force
him to accept any terms whatever; and wars waged to acquire territory, in
order (1) to retain the conquest, or (2) to bargain with the occupied land in
the peace negotiations. In the “Notice” Clausewitz stated his intention of
revising the entire text of On War to develop these different types
systematically. But he went further. As a second major theme the revision
would trace the political character of war. The distinction he drew between
the two themes is puzzling since the previous paragraph declares that
political motives determine whether a conflict is limited or unlimited.
Clausewitz did not explain his separation of the dual nature of war and the
political character of war, but Eberhard Kessel has suggested a reason based
on arguments and observations that recur throughout Clausewitz’s
writings.19 War is influenced by objective and by subjective political
factors. The objective factors comprise the specific characteristics and
strengths of the state in question, and the general characteristics of the age
—political, economic, technological, intellectual, and social. The subjective

factors consist in the free will of the leadership, which should conform to
the objective realities, but often does not. Put differently, Clausewitz
separated the political consequences of general conditions and those arising
from individual intelligence, emotions, genius. He may have sought
analytic clarity by linking his discussion of the objective political realities
mainly to the concept of the dual nature of war, and the issues of leadership
mainly to the concept of the political character of war. But however
Clausewitz’s programmatic statement is interpreted, the reader of On War
will find himself in accord with its author if he gives the political motives
and character of war more prominence than they receive in much of the
text, and, further, if he amends the unrevised sections to the effect that
limited wars need not be a modification, but that theoretically and in reality
two equally valid types of war exist.

way of historical study, which convinced him that limited conflicts had
often occurred not because the protagonists’ means precluded greater effort
or their leadership had faltered, but because their intentions were too
limited to justify anything more. In the face of the historical evidence,
theory had to be corrected. As Clausewitz insisted throughout his life, the
present could claim no final superiority over the past; and to be valid at all,
theory must be universally valid. From the first, as we know, history helped
guide his ideas on war. It may be thought that this was hardly unusual. Just
as few theorists failed to acknowledge the role psychological factors played
in war, so most proclaimed the value of military history for a sound
understanding of war. But what Clausewitz had in mind differed profoundly
from the unreflective chronicles and utilitarian illustrations of strategic and
tactical “laws” that passed for history in the military literature. He did not
regard history as a book of examples from which soldiers could learn,
directly or by analogy. His individualizing way of thinking, which enabled
him to single out the force of character and intelligence in the clash of mass
armies, and to interpret institutions, societies, and nations as larger
personalities—separate and different from each other—extended to his view
of the past. History, too, was marked by constant variety, not subject to
patterns—the march of progress, for instance, or man’s search for God—
which to Clausewitz were simply assumptions created by fashion,
themselves always changing. Each period existed for itself, not as part of a

grand scheme, and could be understood only on its own terms. Certain large
themes recurred throughout time; they derived from the elementary human
desires for safety, strength, knowledge, but they expressed themselves in
constantly changing forms. Like military theory, history had no lessons or
rules to offer the student, it could only broaden his understanding and
strengthen his critical judgment.

In Clausewitz’s pedagogic and theoretical work, history had the

additional function of expanding the student’s or reader’s experience, or
substituting for it when experience was lacking. History depicted reality and
stood for reality. The role of theory, on the contrary, Clausewitz once
declared, was merely to help us comprehend history—a highly telling
reversal of roles that few other theorists would have agreed with or even
understood.20

This conception imposed certain demands on the writing and study of

history that constitute a further difference between Clausewitz and most of
his contemporaries. Generalized accounts of the past he considered useless;
far better, he said, to study one campaign in minute detail than to acquire
vague knowledge of a dozen wars. His own historical writing shows a
concern for specifics that in his day was exceptional, the more so since the
mass of statistical, organizational, and cartographic data is combined with
very extensive speculations on intentions and implications. On War is full
of historical references. They have often been criticized—and sometimes
deleted—as unnecessary, outdated detail; in fact they are depictions of
reality that alone justify the theoretical superstructure, and that should
stimulate the modern reader to reflect on his own experiences, to have
recourse to his knowledge of events of his own time as well as of the past.

When Clausewitz decided that the text of On War must be recast to take

sufficient account of the dual nature and political character of war, he did
not complete the manuscript but instead turned to historical research.
Between 1827 and 1830, when new duties interrupted his studies, he
revised only a few chapters of On War; most of his time was given to
writing histories of the campaign of 1815 and of two limited wars, the
Italian campaigns of 1796 and 1799.21 He needed to understand how his
ideas worked in reality before he could proceed to their systematic
theoretical treatment. When he might have felt ready to return to On War,

external circumstances intervened. His transfer to the army’s artillery
inspectorate compelled him to familiarize himself with a branch of the
service of which he knew relatively little. Hardly had he taken up his new
assignment when the French Revolution of 1830 brought about another
change. His friend Gneisenau was recalled to active service to command the
army that Prussia mobilized, and he asked for Clausewitz as his chief of
staff. As the cautious foreign policy of the new French regime and the
Polish uprising against Russia shifted the crisis to the east, Gneisenau’s
forces were deployed along the East Prussian border to protect the country
against Polish incursions and the cholera, which had spread from Russia to
Poland. The epidemic could not be halted, however, and in August 1831
Gneisenau became one of its victims. On 16 November, shortly after he had
returned to his regular duty as Inspector General of the Silesian artillery,
Clausewitz died suddenly, probably of a heart attack brought about by a
relatively mild case of the cholera.

needed further development, and passages in On War and in the
correspondence of his last years point to important additions to theory that
he never worked out in detail. Book Six, for instance, explicitly states that
the dual nature of war applies to defensive as well as offensive war, but the
definition in the opening chapter of the work refers only to the side that
initiates the conflict. Perhaps this was one reason why in the “Notice” he
singles out his treatment of the defensive as being little more than a first
attempt that must be completely reworked. Again, his definitions assume
that ultimately political and military goals were parallel, even though he
was aware that their relationship tended to be more complex and that goals
might change in the course of fighting. Despite the remarkable invention of
the concept of escalation, Clausewitz never sufficiently explored the various
ways in which one side influences the other, particularly in the defensive.
But these are comments not criticisms. They remind us once more of the
manner in which Clausewitz formed and refined his ideas. They also
suggest the vitality of these ideas, which never coalesced into a finite
system, but led to hypotheses that over a century-and-a-half have shown the
capacity for continuing growth that Clausewitz believed to be the mark of
true theory.

MICHAEL HOWARD

The Influence of Clausewitz

played some part in preventing Clausewitz’s ideas from being more widely
known.23

But the basic cause for Clausewitz’s continuing obscurity must be sought

in the text itself. So also must the wide diversity of interpretations to which
it was to be subjected. Clausewitz himself had warned that if he did not live
to complete his task he would leave behind “a shapeless mass of ideas”
which would be endlessly misinterpreted and “made the target of much
half-baked criticism.” It was also a mass from which, because Clausewitz
did not live to mold it into a finished and coherent shape, later writers were
to quarry ideas and phrases to suit the needs of their own theories and their
own times. Clausewitz, as it turned out, had less cause to fear his critics
than to be wary of many of his professed admirers.

In the introductory note he wrote in 1827 Clausewitz made the position

clear. He had completed six books. The seventh and eighth were still only
rough drafts. When these were finished he would go through the entire
work again and bring out the two great themes which would receive their
final clarification in the last book. The first theme was the “dual nature” of
war, as an instrument which could be used either to overthrow the enemy or
to exact from him a limited concession. The second was the point “that
must be made absolutely clear, namely that war is simply the continuation
of policy by other means.” This, he warned, “if firmly kept in mind
throughout ... will greatly facilitate the study of the subject and the whole
will be easier to analyze” (see below, p. 69). But he had to rely on his
readers to keep it in mind. His own revision went no further than the first
chapter of Book One where he introduces us to the three elements in his
theory: the intrinsic violence of war; the dominant role of rational policy in
shaping and controlling it; and the all-important dimension of chance.

The above-quoted note makes it clear that had Clausewitz lived to finish

the work it would have been the second of the above three elements which
would have received the most emphasis: the dominance which the political
end should exert over the military means. As it is, however, Clausewitz has
very little to say about this even in Book Three on strategy. Strategy he
defines baldly as “the use of the engagement for the purposes of the war”
(see below, p. 177). It is here that we find the doctrine which was to be
seized on so avidly by later writers: “The best strategy is to be very strong:

first everywhere, and then at the decisive point” (see below, p. 204). The
two types of war and the possibility that each might need to be conducted
according to different principles receives here only the most glancing of
references. In general the strategy dealt with in this book is simply the
strategy, as Clausewitz saw it, of Napoleon; of war as “absolute” as the
dictates of a powerful political motivation could make it.

The same limitation applies even more strongly to Book Four, “The

Engagement.” Here we find not a word about the two types of war or the
supremacy of the political object. The centerpiece of this book is the major
battle (Hauptschlacht) and its consequences; what Clausewitz termed “the
true center of gravity of the war.” Yet almost by definition “limited wars”
are conflicts in which the issue is not brought to such a massive decision. It
might be pleaded that this book emphasizes the central paradox of all war,
the dialectic between the forces of violence and the forces of reason, and
that the political requirement for rational control can no more mitigate the
essentially violent nature of the means than the precise manipulation of an
oxyacetylene flame diminishes its heat. Clausewitz was indeed at pains to
reiterate this point in the revised first chapter of Book One, which must be
taken as his considered view on the subject: “Kind-hearted people might
think that there was some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy
without too much bloodshed and might imagine this is the true goal of the
art of war. Pleasant as it sounds, this is a fallacy that must be exposed” (see
below, p. 75). Thus, there is no reason to suppose that Clausewitz would in
his revision have abandoned any of the beliefs expressed in Book Four,
beliefs set out in phrases of dreadful vividness, the outcome of his own
terrible experiences in 1806 and from 1812 to 1815. But perhaps he might
have considered more deeply how this inexorably destructive flame could
be moderated and controlled to serve the political ends he regarded as
paramount.

As it was Clausewitz did not survive to make these revisions. In the text

which he left behind him we find that, of the three elements in his theory,
the political element, that by which he came to set the most store, is dealt
with only in the last book and the first chapter of the first. It is the other two
elements, the intrinsic violence of war and the omnipresence of chance,
together with the demands which both make upon moral qualities, which
are stressed throughout the rest of the work—except indeed in the long,

rich, and complex Book Six on defense, which badly needed revision if its
lessons were to be clearly brought out.

forcibly impressed posterity, not least the great Helmuth von Moltke, who
became Chief of the Prussian General Staff in 1857, and who played the
leading part in bringing Clausewitz’s work to the attention of his
countrymen. Moltke was to cite On War together with Homer and the Bible
as one of the truly seminal works which had molded his own thinking.24 He
had been at the War Academy when Clausewitz was Superintendent but
since Clausewitz had had virtually no contact with the students, there could
have been no question of direct influence. Moreover, as Moltke’s most
recent biographer has pointed out,25 many of the ideas we now think of as
peculiarly Clausewitzian and to which Moltke was so signally to give effect
in his campaigns—the annihilation of the enemy’s main force, the
concentration of effort at the decisive point, the overriding importance of
moral forces, the need for self-reliance in the commander and flexibility in
tactical method—were commonplaces among young Prussian officers who
had shared the Napoleonic experience. As with so many thinkers, many of
the ideas which Clausewitz codified and transmitted to posterity may have
been shared generally, if unconsciously, among his contemporaries, and so
intelligent and sensitive a pupil as Moltke would have quickly picked them
up from his environment. Moltke’s thinking should perhaps be seen rather
as reinforcing and demonstrating Clausewitz’s ideas than as simply deriving
from them.

But it was Moltke’s achievement in the German wars of unification in

1866 and 1870 which drew attention to the abiding validity of Clausewitz’s
work. In Moltke’s own writings we find over and over again passages
which echo Clausewitz. “Victory through the application of armed force is
the decisive factor in war ... it is not the occupation of a slice of territory or
the capture of a fortress but the destruction of the enemy forces which will
decide the outcome of the war. This destruction thus constitutes the
principal object of operations.” And again “Strategy is a system of
expedients. It is more than a science, it is a science applied to everyday life
. . . the art of acting under the pressure of most arduous circumstances.”26

And perhaps the most influential reflection of all: “In war it is often less

important what one does than how one does it. Strong determination and
perseverance in carrying through a simple idea are the surest routes to one’s
objective.”27 This was the kind of thing that appealed to practical soldiers.

But what one does not find in Moltke, or indeed in any of his disciples or

successors, is any reflection of Clausewitz’s insistence on the need for
military means to be subordinate to political ends. He showed no signs,
either in his writings or his work as Chief of Staff, of understanding
Clausewitz’s requirement for war to be versatile if it were to serve the
political object. For Moltke war was not so much an instrument of policy as
the inevitable fate of mankind, to be stoically endured and efficiently
conducted. Certainly, he accepted the supremacy of the political authority
so long as it was the King himself, the War Lord whose uniform he wore
and to whom he had sworn allegiance. But it did not extend to the King’s
political advisers, who had no business whatever, in Moltke’s view, to
meddle in the matters which the King had delegated to him. When war
broke out, he considered, “at the moment of mobilization the political
adviser should fall silent, and should take the lead again only when the
Strategist has informed the King, after the complete defeat of the enemy,
that his task has been fulfilled.”28

All this of course was totally at variance with Clausewitz’s teaching

about the relationship between the military and the political authorities as
set out in Book Eight of On War. This assumed the continuing direction of
the campaign by the cabinet as a whole, suggesting indeed that the military
commander should be made a member of that body so that it could take part
in making crucial strategic decisions.29 But it was Moltke’s view of the
matter, not that of Clausewitz, which became dominant in Imperial
Germany toward the end of the nineteenth century, even though it was
during these years that Clausewitz was being most widely acclaimed. A
fourth edition of On War appeared in 1880. The esteem in which
Clausewitz was now held in Germany can be judged by the words with
which, in 1883, Colmar von der Goltz opened his famous work Das Volk im
Waffen, which ran into many editions and was translated into English as The
Nation in Arms: “A military writer who, after Clausewitz, writes upon war,
runs the risk of being likened to the poet who, after Goethe, attempts a
Faust, or, after Shakespeare, a Hamlet. Everything of any importance to be

said about the nature of war can be found stereotyped in the works left
behind by that greatest of military thinkers.”30

In 1905 a fifth edition was published with a commendatory introduction

by the then Chief of the General Staff, Count Alfred von Schlieffen. Three
more were to follow before the outbreak of the Great War, and no less than
five during the war itself.

During this period Clausewitz’s teaching about the relationship between

war and policy was not ignored. Indeed it caused a certain bewilderment
among his admirers. General von Caemmerer, the most distinguished
Clausewitz scholar of his generation, drew attention to the divergence on
this subject between Clausewitz and Moltke, and expressed himself
convinced “of the correctness in every respect of Clausewitz’s views.”31

But von der Goltz expressed the majority view in refusing to accept this. It
was not that he ignored the political element in the Clausewitzian trinity. He
considered it to be no longer relevant. The situation, he claimed, had
changed since Clausewitz had written. Now “if two European Powers of the
first order collide, their whole organized forces will at once be set in motion
to decide the quarrel. All political considerations bred of the half-
heartedness of wars of alliance fall to the ground.” War was certainly an
instrument of policy in that war arose from a political situation; but, he
continued: “War will on that account be in no way lowered in importance
nor restricted in its independence, if only the commander in chief and the
leading statesmen are agreed that, under all circumstances, war serves the
end of politics best by a complete defeat of the enemy. By attention to this
maxim the widest scope is allowed in the employment of the fighting
forces.”32

Thus, ingeniously, von der Goltz made the best of both worlds,

reconciling the supremacy of policy with the independence of the
commander. Given the increasing difficulties of military planning as armies
grew ever larger, less flexible, at the mercy of railway timetables, it was
probably the best that could be done to adapt Clausewitz’s teaching to the
exigencies of military policy in the Wilhelmine Era.

For it was not only in Germany that Clausewitz’s views on this matter

were seen, at the beginning of the twentieth century, to be increasingly
anachronistic. In France Colonel Foch wrote in 1903 in his Principles of

War, “You must henceforth go to the very limits to find the aim of war.
Since the vanquished party now never yields before it has been deprived of
all means of reply, what you have to aim at is the destruction of those very
means of reply.”33 Even a very much more balanced French authority,
Colonel Colin, whose The Transformation of War still ranks as the
outstanding summary of the military situation in Europe on the eve of the
Great War, wrote in exactly the same terms:

Without speaking of the passions that would animate most of the
belligerents, the material conditions of modern war no longer admit of
the avoidance of the radical decision by battle. The two armies
occupying the whole area of the theatre of operations march towards
each other, and there is no issue but victory.... Therefore the
indications which a government should give to a general on the
political object is reduced to a very small affair. Once the war is
decided on, it is absolutely necessary that a general should be left free
to conduct it at his own discretion, subject to seeing himself relieved of
his command if he uses his discretion with but little energy or
competence.34

 
Such was the philosophy which was to animate, not only the Germans,

but all the belligerent powers at the outset of the Great War. But it was not
the strategic thinkers, nor even the requirements of military technology, that
molded the experience of 1914 and the terrible years that followed.
Clausewitz himself had written: “The aims a belligerent adopts and the
resources he employs must be governed by the particular characteristics of
his own position; but they will also conform to the spirit of the age and its
general character.”35 It is in the light of this aphorism that the experience of
the First World War has to be understood.

If there were understandable reasons, technical, political, and

psychological, why Clausewitz’s teaching about the subordination of the
military means to the political end were no longer seen to be relevant in
1914, the same can hardly be said about his views on defense as the
stronger form of war; views which had become more significant with
practically every new development in military technology since 1870.
Moltke himself had endorsed them, as had Caemmerer,36 but very few other

German writers did, and even fewer French. Von der Goltz was typical of
the former.37 “To make war means to attack,” he wrote, and “happy the
soldier to whom fate assigns the part of the assailant.” In concluding an
account of an imaginary battle he summed up: “In describing a battle we
have been led, in spite of ourselves, to depict an offensive battle. What
German soldier could do otherwise?” In fact, one German soldier had done
otherwise, and that was Clausewitz himself. His picture of a battle in
Chapter Two of Book Four was that of a grueling bataille d’usure; not all
that different, on a very much smaller scale, from the battles which
developed on the Western Front between 1915 and 1917. But, suggested
Goltz, Clausewitz might have “changed his views as to the superiority of
the defense over the attack if he had had the opportunity of carefully
revising his original text”; an argument frequently used by admirers of
Clausewitz—the present writer not excepted—who find aspects of his work
not wholly to their liking.

If Clausewitz’s teaching about the defensive was ignored and his views

on the relations between war and policy were considered anachronistic, why
then was he so admired in the German army? Primarily for his achievement,
as Hans Rothfels has stated,38 in turning strategic thought away from a
mechanistic concern with geometrical relations “to man and man’s actions
in the midst of all the uncertainties which are the proper element of war.”
Caemmerer singled out the chapters on “The Genius for War,” “Friction in
µWar,” and “Tension and Rest in War,” together with the first and third
books generally as being the most influential in educating the Prussian
army. “They freed us from all that artificiality which gave itself such airs in
the theory of war and have shown us what, after all, is the real point.”39

Wilhelm Blume, in his widely read Strategie (first published in 1884)
echoes Clausewitz when he wrote that “Every theory ... which seeks to bind
the reciprocal action of living forces by dead theories, must be rejected, for
it will in practice have disastrous results.”40 And it was to this aspect of
Clausewitz’s teaching that von Schlieffen drew attention in his introduction
to the fifth edition of On War in 1905. Clausewitz, he wrote, had taught
“that every case in war must be considered and thought through in its own
right (nach seiner Eigenart).” It was, he said, “the awakening of this

recognition as a reality for which the Prussian and now the entire German
army owes the great thinker everlasting thanks.”41

Second, Clausewitz was quoted for his emphasis on the preeminence of

moral forces in war. Clausewitzian phrases about the will-power of the
commander, his need for resolution, self-confidence and coup d’oeil
resound through German military writings; though perhaps it was the
influence of Moltke rather than of Clausewitz which stressed the need for
these qualities at every level of command and not simply in the
commander-in-chief. The emphasis on simplicity and directness rather than
on ingenious maneuver, on resolution rather than on subtlety, on bold
initiative rather than on elaborate calculation was to be found in every
German textbook between 1870 and 1914;42 all the more so since the
conditions of twentieth-century warfare clearly made these qualities even
more vital to military success than they had been in the Napoleonic era. In
the enormous armies of 1900, their communications dependent at best on
fragile field-telephones, their size and complexity rendering elaborate
maneuver out of the question, commanders-in-chief could give only the
broadest of directives to their subordinates and rely on their intelligence and
initiative to carry them out in detail. Junior officers were likely to find
themselves isolated on vast battlefields in a strange, sometimes barely
endurable environment, with no recourse save their inner strength to keep
them going and their common sense to tell them what to do. For these
circumstances Clausewitz’s teaching was marvelously appropriate, and his
disciples did very well to stress it.

And what was the object of all this resolution, all this common sense?

Again Clausewitz seemed to provide a clear and simple answer; the
annihilation of the enemy; the aspect of his teaching which Schlieffen
stressed in his introduction to the fifth edition of On War. As to whether this
was always and necessarily so, whether Clausewitz’s doctrine of the two
kinds of war did not imply a valid alternative objective in the attrition of
the enemy, a scholarly controversy raged in military and historical
periodicals for thirty years, a controversy centering on the military historian
Hans Delbrück, who as early as 1881 put forward the thesis that if
Clausewitz had lived to revise his work he would have devoted far more
appreciation and attention to this strategy of attrition (Ermattungsstrategie)

which had distinguished eighteenth-century warfare and the campaigns of
Frederick 
the 
Great, 
as 
against 
the 
strategy 
of 
annihilation

(Vernichtungsstrategie) characteristic of Napoleon.43 The experience of the
First World War was most gloomily to justify Delbrück’s view that the
former strategy was no less valid than the latter; but since no echo of that
view found its way into German military textbooks before 1914, the
question remained academic. The object of strategy, German soldiers were
taught, was the destruction of the enemy armed forces by battle; and the
greater the battle, the more effectively could that object be achieved.

Of course, all this was to be found in Clausewitz. Not only was the

concept of battle central to his strategic thought, but he wrote about it with a
vigor and a vivacity which make those chapters leap from the pages like a
splash of scarlet against a background of scholarly gray.44 The famous
phrases about the inevitability of bloody slaughter in a successful battle and
of bloody battles in a successful strategy were taken up and quoted with
grisly relish; not so much in serious military textbooks as in the popular
militaristic writings of von der Goltz, Bernhardi, and their innumerable
imitators in the Wilhelmine Reich. The name of Clausewitz became
associated in the popular mind with battle and blood. As for the military
specialists, the concept of annihilation as the object of strategy was no less
dominant—if only because they could not see how else, under the
conditions of early twentieth-century warfare wars, especially wars
conducted by Germany on two fronts, could conceivably be won. As
Schlieffen himself wrote: “It is not possible to conduct a strategy of attrition
when the support of millions of combattants runs into milliards of marks
.”45 If Germany could not destroy one or other of her principal adversaries
as rapidly and as totally as she had destroyed French military power in
1870, she was likely eventually to be squeezed to death between them. To
that extent the strategy of annihilation appeared inevitable. What Schlieffen
and his successors underrated were the limitations of a strategic plan which,
in concentrating on the destruction of a major land power, provoked the
antagonism of a major sea power. But then Clausewitz himself never
considered the significance of sea power in the Napoleonic wars. With all
its depth and genius, his strategic thinking was intensely parochial,
conceived as it was within the framework of a land-locked Prussia. By his

own definition strategy was concerned with the movement of armies. None
of his disciples considered how his teaching might be adapted to the
requirements of a German Empire with aspirations to world power.

So far we have considered the influence of Clausewitz on the German

army alone. But the German army was, at the beginning of the twentieth
century, the model for all others, and in imitating its training methods and
tactical doctrines foreign armies absorbed the doctrines of Clausewitz as
much unconsciously as consciously. But the French did so quite
consciously. A French translation of On War had been published as early as
1849 and four years later a commentary on it was published by a professor
at Saint-Cyr.46 Neither work appears to have made much impression on a
French army which assumed inborn genius in its commander and required
of its junior officers only obedience to orders, a good seat on a horse, and
unflinching bravery under fire. The events of 1870 proved these to be
insufficient equipment for the responsibilities of modern warfare, but as a
result most French military writers set about studying, not why the Prussian
army had won, but what the great Napoleon would have done had he been
presented with the same problem. Clausewitz was considered, insofar as he
was considered at all, as one interpreter of the true Napoleonic doctrine
among many, and one who had as often as not distorted the pure beams of
that sacred truth.47 But one French writer had begun independently to
explore the relationship of moral to physical forces in war—Colonel Ardent
du Picq, who was killed at Metz in 1870 and whose Etudes sur le Combat,
when it was published ten years later, won immediate acclaim. Attention
was thus already becoming focused on the question of morale when an
instructor at the Ecole de Guerre, Lucien Cardot, was inspired by reading
von der Goltz to give a course of lectures on Clausewitz in 1884 which was
to influence an entire generation of French officers; the generation which
was to mold the thinking of the French army at the turn of the century and
to lead it during the Great War.48

These men seized upon the Clausewitzian teaching about morale, about

the battle, and about the offensive spirit, and preached it with an enthusiasm
which outmatched even the Germans. Their ardor was fanned by a national
mystique about the furia francese and by the contemporary popular
philosophy of Henry Bergson, with all its emphasis on l’élan vital. It was a

mood rather than a doctrine, and one which found its greatest exponent in
one of the officers who had attended Cardot’s lectures: Ferdinand Foch. In
fact, by the end of the century the French army had become as totally
imbued with these oversimplified neo-Clausewitzian ideas as had its
German adversaries. Witness the Field Service Regulations of 1895:
“Combat may be offensive or defensive, but it always has for its end to
break by force the will of the enemy and to impose on him our own. Only
the offensive permits the obtaining of decisive results. The passive defense
is doomed to certain defeat; it is to be rejected absolutely.”49

And this teaching seemed justified by the lessons of the next major

conflict between great powers, the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. In their
conduct of operations, the Japanese army displayed all the qualities so
lauded by Clausewitz: the offensive spirit, the simple and direct strategy,
the initiative at every level, as against the passivity of their Russian
adversaries. Whether the Japanese army would have performed in the same
manner if they had not been trained by an enthusiastic disciple of
Clausewitz, General von Meckel, is a reasonable matter for speculation; but
certainly On War had been translated into Japanese, and the Japanese
commanders politely acknowledged their debt to it.50

The debt was noted by the military observers of that other island Empire,

Great Britain, who observed the performance of their new ally in the Far
East with particular interest.51 After the humiliating performance of the
British army against the Boer Republics in South Africa, 1899- 1902, a
revival of military thinking was under way in Britain—a revival hastened
by a growing perception of the possibility that in the not far distant future
Britain might become involved in land warfare against the German army.
An English translation of On War by Colonel J. J. Graham had appeared in
1874, but it had long been out of print. The general contemptuous ignorance
in which Clausewitz was held by British soldiers was probably well
summed up by the most admired of all the teachers at the Staff College,
Colonel G.F.R. Henderson, who in a lecture at the Royal United Services
Institution in 1894 on “Lessons of the Past for the Present” had mentioned
Clausewitz only to say, sarcastically and inaccurately: “Clausewitz, the
most profound of all writers on war, says that everyone understands what
moral force is and how it is applied. But Clausewitz was a genius, and

geniuses and clever men have a distressing habit of assuming that everyone
understands what is perfectly clear to themselves.”52

This complacent anti-intellectualism, which has long been the

predominant characteristic of a British army which takes a perverse delight
in learning all its lessons the hard way, was temporarily shaken in the ten
years before 1914.53 Clausewitz began to receive almost as much attention
at Camberley as he did in Continental Staff Colleges. A new, truncated
translation was published by T. M. Maguire in 1909, but simultaneously
Colonel Graham’s translation was reprinted, with an introduction by
Colonel F. N. Maude drawing attention to its relevance for an army likely to
have to encounter the Germans, in the three red volumes through which so
many British and American readers have come to know On War for the past
seventy years. But, more interestingly, Clausewitz was studied also by
Britain’s leading naval historian, Sir Julian Corbett, who in his Principles of
Maritime Strategy (1911) based on the lectures he had given at the Royal
Naval College Greenwich, both indicated Clausewitz’s relevance to the
problems of naval warfare, and added a new and significant dimension to
his concept of Limited War. Corbett was one of the very few thinkers who
not only interpreted Clausewitz for his own generation but constructively
developed his ideas.54

Hardly had Clausewitz become known in the Anglo-Saxon world than a

powerful reaction set in against him. After 1914 British readers saw him,
especially as interpreted by Bernhardi and von der Goltz, as a prophet of
that bloodthirsty “Prussianism” against which they had taken up arms.
Liberals on both sides of the Atlantic seized on garbled versions of his
teaching about the relationship of war to policy as evidence of naked and
unashamed militarism. Clausewitz’s popularity in Germany during the
Great War was reason enough for him to be unpopular with Germany’s
enemies. And this unpopularity was to be inherited by a postwar generation
which saw in the holocaust of the First World War the direct result of
Clausewitz’s teaching. Nor were they entirely wrong. Clausewitz can hardly
be blamed for those distorted notions of the offensive which sent nearly a
million young Frenchmen to their deaths in 1914 and 1915. But in the
grinding battles of attrition of 1916 and 1917 and the arguments used to
justify them, one can clearly trace a Clausewitzian philosophy both of

tactics and of strategy. The skepticism for strategic maneuver; the
accumulation of maximum force at the decisive point in order to defeat the
enemy main force in battle; the conduct of operations so as to inflict the
greatest possible number of losses on the enemy and compel him to use up
his reserves at a greater rate than one was expending one’s own; the dogged
refusal to be put off by heavy casualties; all these familiar Clausewitzian
principles were deployed to justify the continuation of attacks on the
Western Front by British commanders who almost self-consciously
embodied those qualities of calm, determination and perseverance which
Clausewitz had praised so highly.

It is not surprising therefore that the leading British postwar critic of the

Western Front strategy, Captain B. H. Liddell Hart, should have extended
his censures to include Clausewitz himself as well as his disciples. Liddell
Hart in his many writings admitted that those disciples had often
misunderstood Clausewitz because of the “obscurity” of his writings, but
his 
own 
comments 
often 
revealed 
a 
comparable 
degree 
of

misunderstanding. Clausewitz, he wrote, “had proclaimed the sovereign
virtues of the will to conquer, the unique value of the offensive carried out
with unlimited violence by a nation in arms and the power of military
action to override everything else”55 (my italics). In view of Clausewitz’s
explicit and repeated insistence on the need to subordinate military means
to political ends this final assertion is puzzling. Even more curious was
Liddell Hart’s anathema of Clausewitz in his book The Ghost of Napoleon
published at the height of the reaction against the Western Front strategy in
1933: “He was the source of the doctrine of ‘absolute war,’ the fight to a
finish theory which, beginning with the argument that ‘war is only a
continuation of state policy by other means,’ ended by making policy the
slave of strategy ... Clausewitz looked only to the end of war, not beyond
war to the subsequent peace.”56

Clausewitz did, Liddell Hart agreed, recognize “a modification in the

reality” and taught that “the political object should determine the effort
made”; but “unfortunately his qualifications came on later pages and were
conveyed in a philosophical language that befogged the plain soldier,
essentially concrete minded.”57 Of course the “qualifications” are very
emphatically set out, as an intrinsic part of Clausewitz’s argument, not “on

later pages,” but the very first chapter; but of this chapter Liddell Hart was
to write “Not one reader in a hundred was likely to follow the subtlety of
his logic or to preserve a true balance among such philosophical
jugglery.”58 The reader will have to judge the correctness of this verdict for
himself.

Finally Liddell Hart, having castigated the Clausewitzian concept of

“absolute war,” proposed in its place a “strategy of limited aim.” A
government, he suggested,

may desire to wait, or even to limit its military effort permanently,
while economic or naval action decides the issue. It may calculate that
the overthrow of the enemy’s military power is a task definitely
beyond its capacity, or not worth the effort—and that the object of its
war policy can be assured by seizing territory which it can either retain
or use as bargaining counters when peace is negotiated.... There is
ground for inquiry whether this “conservative” military policy does not
deserve to be accorded a place in the theory of the conduct of war.59

 
One does not need to read very far in Clausewitz—no further, indeed,

than the first paragraph of the “Notice” of 10 July 1827—before finding the
most explicit and lucid exposition of precisely this doctrine of “limited
aim.”

In many respects Liddell Hart’s critique of Clausewitz was quite

justified: the reiterated emphasis on battle, the small concern for maneuver,
a definition of “strategy” which ignored all save purely military means, the
ignoring of naval and economic factors, the tortuous and self-contradictory
quality of much of the writing; all these were shortcomings which, however
understandable in their context, needed and still need to be pointed out. But
the final picture Liddell Hart painted of Clausewitz’s teaching was
distorted, inaccurate, and unfair. And since Liddell Hart was in his time
probably the most widely read military writer in the English-speaking
world, this picture was by the Second World War very generally accepted as
true.

In Germany however Clausewitz lost none of his popularity. During the

1920’s General von Seeckt continued to hammer home to the Reichswehr
the lessons Schlieffen had derived from him: the importance of the

initiative, of moral forces, of flexibility and self-reliance, of the study of
historical examples as guides to action.60 A fourteenth edition of On War
was published in 1933 to celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of
Schlieffen’s birth, and the commander-in-chief of the new Wehrmacht,
General von Blomberg, declared: “In spite of the fundamental
transformation of all technical modalities, Clausewitz’s book On War
remains for all time the basis for any rational development in the Art of
War.”61 Further popular editions followed during the 1930’s as well as
another complete edition in 1937, and articles by such scholars as Karl
Linnebach, Hans Rothfels, Herbert Rosinski, Walther Schering, and
Eberhart Kessel frequently appeared in historical and military periodicals.62

Since he was seen, incorrectly, as a pioneer of German nationalism as well
as the greatest of all writers on war, Clausewitz enjoyed high esteem in the
Nazi pantheon.

The same could not be said of all his students, and two of the most

eminent of them, Hans Rothfels and Herbert Rosinski, had to seek refuge
from racial persecution in the United States. Apart from some perceptive
comments in his book on The German Army (1940) most of Rosinski’s
studies on Clausewitz remained unpublished, but his lectures at universities
and service colleges introduced his work to a wide range of audiences. Hans
Rothfels published a seminal article in E. M. Earle’s collection of studies,
Makers of Modern Strategy (1943) which revealed to a new generation the
Clausewitz who had for so long been studied and admired by German
scholars as well as German soldiers, and went a long way to dissipate the
false image which had dominated the English-speaking world since 1914. A
new translation by O. J. Mattijs Jolles was published in the United States in
1943, clarifying many of the obscurities in the Graham version of On War.

There is little to suggest that Clausewitz was intensively studied in

American military schools between the wars. As Bernard Brodie has made
clear, Jomini’s influence there had remained almost unchallenged since the
days of the Civil War. But those aspects of Clausewitz’s thought which had
dominated European strategic thinking in 1914 had certainly crossed the
Atlantic by the end of the First World War. U.S. Army Field Service
Regulations for 1923 stated: “The ultimate objective of all military
operations is the destruction of the enemy’s armed forces by battle.

Decisive defeat in battle breaks the enemy’s will to war and forces him to
sue for peace.”63

This was certainly the attitude that led General Marshall, when plans had

to be made for the defeat of Germany in the Second World War, to hold so
staunchly to his plan for concentrating the bulk of American forces at the
decisive point, Northwest Europe, the only place where the strength of the
German Wehrmacht could be broken in battle.64

But it was the next great conflict in which the United States took part,

that in Korea in 1950-1953, that led to a serious renewal of Clausewitzian
studies on both sides of the Atlantic. That war compelled the American
government to grapple with two of the problems which Clausewitz had
studied most deeply: the relationship between the civil and the military
powers in the conduct of a war, and the conduct of a war for a limited aim
—that is, one not aimed at the total overthrow of the enemy. The
commander of the United States forces in the Far East, General Douglas
MacArthur, was a firm believer in the creed which had animated European
military thinkers in 1914, and he set it out in terms reminiscent of Moltke
himself:

A theater commander (he informed the Senate after his dismissal) is
not merely limited to the handling of his troops; he commands the
whole area, politically, economically and militarily. At that stage of the
game when politics fails and the military takes over, you must trust the
military.... I do unquestionably state that when men become locked in
battle, that there should be no artifice under the name of politics which
should handicap your own men, decrease their chances for winning,
and increase their losses.65

 
This statement and the attitude which it expressed caused deep concern

both in government circles in the United States and among the growing
community of strategic thinkers on both sides of the Atlantic. The
development of atomic weapons by both sides already made it likely that
the kind of military solution advocated by General MacArthur might
involve a quite unacceptable degree of reciprocal destruction, which the
advent of thermonuclear weapons would soon raise to an inconceivable
order of magnitude. It became almost impossible to visualize any political

objective for which the use of such weapons would be appropriate. It was
hardly necessary to read Clausewitz in order to rediscover the concept of
“limited war.” Like Molière’s M. Jourdain, who had never realized that
what he had been talking all the time was prose, the American forces and
their allies in Korea had been fighting a Clausewitzian “limited war”
without knowing it.

war” needed to acknowledge any debt to Clausewitz.66 They thought the
idea through for themselves. But some, notably Robert Osgood and Bernard
Brodie, found in Clausewitz a pattern of thought whose contribution to their
own they generously acknowledged, and through the influence of these and
other writers Clausewitz began to be studied again, and by a wider
readership than ever before.67 This time he was not only read by soldiers
concerned with the conduct of war but by students of international politics
concerned with the preservation of peace. If the nineteenth century had laid
stress on Clausewitz’s teaching about moral forces, readers in the mid-
twentieth were to concentrate—perhaps almost equally to excess—on his
emphasis on the primacy of the political aim.

This has certainly been the case with the Marxist disciples of Clausewitz.

When Friedrich Engels first came across On War it was not, in fact, this
aspect of Clausewitz’s writing that struck him most forcefully. It was the
analogy between war and commerce to which he drew Marx’s attention; “A
remarkable way of philosophizing about the question,” he commented, “but
very good.” Marx expressed equal approval: “the rascal has a ‘common
sense’ bordering on wit” he replied.68 However, it was on the concept of
“War as the Continuation of Politics by other (i.e. violent) means” that
Lenin focussed in the study Socialism and War (1915). “This dictum,” he
wrote, “was uttered by one of the profoundest writers on the problems of
war. Marxists have always rightly regarded this thesis as the theoretical
basis of views on the significance of any war.69 Every war, he explained, in
this and succeeding pamphlets, was indissolubly linked with the political
order whence it derived, and with the policy pursued by the ruling class. Its
character was ”not determined at the point where the opposing armies take
their stand, [but by] what policy is carried on by the war, what class is
conducting the war and what objectives it is pursuing in the course of it.70

of Marxist-Leninists. Stalin, to be sure, dismissed him as “representative of
the hand-workers era” who had nothing to teach the industrial age. But
respectful references continued to be made in Soviet military literature,
until a new generation felt it necessary to purge Soviet thought of such alien
intrusions. A comprehensive study by B. Byely and others declared that by
denying the class basis of politics, Clausewitz “propounded a false,
idealistic view of politics, which he called the mind of the personified
state.... [He] completely ignored the fact that politics is conditioned by deep
causes rooted in the economic system of society.” Instead they propounded
their own definition: “war is the continuation of the politics of definite
classes and states by other means.”71 Thus modified, Clausewitz is allowed
to retain his place in the communist pantheon, and few Marxist textbooks
on strategy fail to pay at least lip-service to him.

It is thus entirely appropriate that On War should today be studied as

much in universities as in military academies. But it must not be forgotten
that Clausewitz was a soldier writing primarily for soldiers; that he looked
forward to the continuation of war as something natural and inevitable; and
that his teaching was intended for successive generations of patriotic
Germans fighting for their Fatherland—not for world statesmen conducting
international politics in an age of nuclear plenty. Too much should not be
read in Clausewitz, nor should more be expected of him than he intended to
give. It remains the measure of his genius that, although the age for which
he wrote is long since past, he can still provide so many insights relevant to
a generation, the nature of whose problems he could not possibly have
foreseen.

BERNARD BRODIE

The Continuing Relevance of On War

Misunderstood indeed it often has been, but Rosinski’s explanation

somewhat misses the mark. He was a close student of Clausewitz and of
war, and his characterization of the book is sound enough, but when On
War is misunderstood the reason lies not in any inherent difficulty in
comprehending its ideas. Clausewitz’s ideas, though densely packed in, are
generally simple and are for the most part clearly expressed in jargon-free
language, both in the original and in the present translation. However, these
qualities may deceive the casual reader into thinking he is reading mere
commonplaces. That may have been why a retired British officer of exalted
rank, who was certainly not lacking in intelligence, remarked to this writer
some years ago: “I once tried reading Clausewitz, but got nothing out of it.”
If he had encountered strange new ideas requiring some effort to
comprehend them—like some recent strategic essays that use mathematics,
game theory, and the like—he might well have made that effort and perhaps
carried away a feeling of being suitably rewarded. Instead he encountered
wisdom, and thought it was nothing new. Perhaps he also found some of the
ideas not quite to his liking, and not liking ideas is a common reason for
misunderstanding them.

Inasmuch as an introductory essay should have a purpose that warrants

interposing it between the reader and his object, the purpose of this one is
mostly to help him avoid the experience of my distinguished military
acquaintance. One way to avoid it, naturally, is to avoid reading Clausewitz,
which has been the way chosen by all but a minute proportion of literate
people, including the great majority of those who have not hesitated to cite

or quote him. Civilians have not read his work because they have
erroneously deemed the field recondite, or perhaps too remote from their
interests; and the military, except for some special few, have had other
reasons for ignoring it. The present reader, however, having the book in
hand, obviously has the best of intentions. Let him, therefore, be assured at
once that he will not be hindered by abstruse language or difficult-to-
fathom ideas. Books on strategy are anyway not often of that character.
They may be dull or they may be wild, but they are rarely difficult.

attempt to explore, because directly confronting these problems helps to
diminish them. For one thing, large parts of the work are truly dated, and
other large parts sound more dated than they really are because the
historical examples cited to illustrate them are inevitably of older times.
Also, On War is a work in which one easily loses the forest for the trees. Its
very length, stretched by innumerable qualifications to its propositions,
contributes to this quality, and it is certainly not on the same high level
throughout.

Clausewitz himself made clear, in the “Notice” he left with his

manuscript, that the revision he planned for the work would be drastic and
would “rid the first six books of a good deal of superfluous material, fill in
various gaps, large and small, and make a number of generalities more
precise in thought and form.” In expressing his dissatisfaction with the
manuscript as it stood he meant what he said, though many of his most
dedicated interpreters seem to forget that. The contrast is often striking
between the one chapter he regarded as being revised and completed to his
satisfaction, which is the opening chapter of the work, and many of the
other chapters. We must, in short, be prepared for a work which is
unfinished and therefore on the whole imperfectly organized, often
repetitious, and at times even rambling. Sometimes, on the other hand, it is
too spare. Occasionally the exact meaning of one or more points is obscure,
not from any inherent difficulty of comprehension but because the author
did not clearly set down his meaning. What exactly does he mean, for
example, by his important concept of “the culminating point of victory”
when he seems, not by accident, to exclude Napoleon’s march to Moscow
as an example of it? Actually, his omitting it is a clue to his meaning,
though the casual reader will not notice it.

he is basically timeless, everyone is a child of his age and his culture, and
he whose mind eagerly absorbs new ideas will be such in a quite special
way. We have already noted and will say more about the datedness of much
of Clausewitz’s writing, but we encounter also a special idiom, not only of
language but occasionally also of thought. A man who is a young German
at the beginning of the nineteenth century (and whose life will be over
before a third of that century is run), who is intensely intellectual but also
with limited formal education, who is deeply sensitive and passionate and
yet lives in an age and is committed to a profession which together expose
him to an extraordinary experience with war, and who, like all of us, has
certain peculiarities of personality and character, will write in a manner that
somehow reflects these things. With Clausewitz no more than with any
other great thinker and writer are we dealing with a disembodied intellect.

our purpose to attempt the always hazardous business of linking some
special thought Clausewitz expresses to what we know of his experience or
think we can guess of his character, but sometimes it cannot be avoided.
Many readers, for example, have been thrown into confusion at the very
outset of On War by the author’s notion of “absolute war” (a term less used
in this translation than in others), and by the metamorphosis that occurs
within a few pages from concentration on the needs and properties of the
absolute or “pure concept” of war to discussion of something much more
practical. Yet what could be more natural to an author living in the age and
land of Kant and Hegel who is determined to write what readers will
recognize as the most deeply penetrating as well as comprehensive treatise
of war that has ever been written? Actually, Clausewitz’s very slight
infusion of metaphysics into this work poses no problems that cannot be
explained with relatively few words, and it virtually disappears after those
early pages. The greatest misfortune that has resulted from it has been the
reputation accorded Clausewitz even by those who are supposed to know
him well as someone who is deeply philosophical, in the metaphysical
meaning of that term. His contemporary and rival, Antoine Henri Jomini,
was already making such remarks about him—besides calling his work
“excessive and arrogant”—and such appraisals have continued to the
present day.

all the extravagant things that have been written about him and his chief
work. Rosinski, whom we have already quoted, also says the following:
“Out of Scharnhorst’s fragmentary and aphoristic heritage he developed the
systematic, closely knit, perfectly balanced theory, in which every factor,
every aspect, every argument had its place from which it could not be
removed without fatally endangering the delicate balance of the whole.
From the deep appreciation of the revolution wrought by Napoleon in the
art of war, he reached an infinitely broader conception embracing within its
elastic framework and majestic sweep every conceivable form of warfare
and strategy.”73 This hyperbole is clearly denied by Clausewitz himself. A
work which has literally not one word to say about naval warfare can hardly
be covering “every conceivable form of warfare and strategy” even for its
own time, and we have already noted that Clausewitz was planning a
revision which would clearly have removed some “factors” and
“arguments.”

A French scholar of an earlier generation who wrote a book about

Clausewitz speaks of him as le plus Allemand des Allemands ... A tout
instant chez lui on a la sensation d’être dans le brouillard metaphysique
(“The most German of Germans.... In reading him one constantly has the
feeling of being in a metaphysical fog”).74 This is simply nonsense. Such
quotations could be piled up, and they are by people who knew or professed
to know Clausewitz’s work intimately, as Rosinski certainly did. Awe may
be an appropriate mood for some occasions, particularly religious ones, but
it is not conducive to calm, perceptive, and therefore critical study.

We have already said something about readers not liking all the

Clausewitzian ideas. Both soldiers and civilians have disliked some of
them, often for contrary reasons. The soldier trained to revere offensive
spirit does not feel comfortable with the argument that the defensive is
obviously the stronger form of war, and he especially does not like being
told that the military aim must always be subordinated to the political
objectives laid down by the civilian leaders. Among civilians there may be
some who feel that there is more than a shade too much ruthlessness in
Clausewitz, though this attitude is likely to characterize nonreaders who
have formed their opinions by hearsay rather than those who have actually

read the book. Clausewitz knew that war is not a pleasant affair, and he
enjoins the reader to be immediately clear about that too, so that they can
proceed jointly to consider the business in hand—which is to understand
basically what war is all about, on its various levels of commitment and of
violence. One purpose of such understanding is to increase chances of
success in this most demanding of pursuits.

often also foolish. His countryman and older contemporary, Immanuel
Kant, whose work he knew and respected, had written a tract, Perpetual
Peace (1795), reasserting that idea within the framework of the new
knowledge of his time. But this view enjoyed immeasurably less acceptance
then than it does today, which is not to say that it is altogether
commonplace now. Anyway, here was a man whose military career was
begun when he was age twelve, in an army still imbued with the traditions
of Frederick the Great, at a moment that marked the onset of nearly a
quarter-century of wars with Revolutionary and Napoleonic France. Also,
from what clues he left in his letters and his personal behavior about the
nature of his inner life, he seems to have had something more than the usual
psychological need for recognition, which for him could come only through
some mode of excellence in the profession in which he found himself. Thus
there is no reason to wonder at his dedication to his grim subject. He was
sufficiently sensitive to the extreme costs and hazards of war, of which he
had had no lack of personal experience, to place a high value on
competence in conducting it expertly and thus with optimum chance of
success. Also, what is much rarer, he attached comparable importance to
understanding its purpose.

But the reader may have another and more stubborn concern. Can it be,

he will ask, that a book written a century and a half ago, and on war of all
things, is really worth his time? That question would arise even if nuclear
weapons had never been invented, but those weapons do indeed seem to
make a totally new universe. Or do they? There has been a good deal of
fighting without nuclear weapons since the two were used on Japan in 1945,
including wars which for some of the participants represented total
commitment. Still, if it is not yet an established fact it is at minimum a
strong possibility that, at least between the great powers who possess
nuclear weapons, the whole character of war as a means of settling

differences has been transformed beyond all recognition. Why then read
Clausewitz?

In our crowded times, it is not enough to argue that a book has

exceptional merit. Too many books do which we have no time to read. The
commitment to the reading of a substantial book like the present one
represents in striking fashion the play of what the economist calls
“opportunity cost” (that relinquished object or benefit which might have
been gained for the same units of value). Reading time, even for the most
favored, is a sharply limited commodity. The reading of a serious book is
therefore always a serious undertaking, rationally considered in the form of
the following question: Is the reading of this book at this time worth more
to me than the reading of any other works that I could read with the same
time?

It is well that we do not keep this question at the forefronts of our minds,

or we should worry so much each time whether we have made the
supremely right choice that we should get nothing read. Still, except for
some circumstances where the choices are made for us, as in undergraduate
courses, we do in fact tend to keep this question somewhere in the backs of
our minds. We pick and choose among books to read and put many of them
down unfinished. Among the books we skip are usually the classics,
especially those which are not purely literary, because we tend to assume,
first, that however great they were in their own times they are not
particularly pertinent to ours, and second, that whatever wisdom they do
contain which is relevant to our times has no doubt been absorbed and
exploited by later writers.

Clausewitz’s On War does not conform with either assumption. Other

classics may sometimes be worth reading because they have a distinctive
flavor not fully represented or captured even by those later writers who
have fully absorbed and refined their thought—Darwin’s Origin of Species
comes to mind, and there are others. But Clausewitz’s work stands out
among those very few older books which have presented profound and
original insights that have not been adequately absorbed in later literature.
Naturally, it will be read only by those who have some strong interest,
professional or otherwise, in the subject of its title, but for them it is quite
indispensable. Of course, there are other books in the field much worth
reading in addition to Clausewitz, certainly including some dealing with

contemporary and especially nuclear weapons issues, but none can equal it
in importance or displace it in its timelessness.

and issues of World War I than was Ferdinand Foch’s Principles of War,
published in 1903, only eleven years before that war began. For Foch and
his followers the idea of the dominance of the political objective, of which
Clausewitz made so much, simply did not apply to modern times. In
addition, they romanticized the role of the commander and apotheosized the
offensive to a fantastic degree that also proved, insofar as it was followed in
action, inordinately costly. Foch gave lip service to the name of Clausewitz,
whose work he claimed to have read and absorbed, but his own writing is of
totally different character.

general, but altogether more soberly than Foch. He weighed with great care
the relationship of the offensive to the defensive, concluding that the latter
was the stronger form of war. If it was so in his time, it was much more so
in Foch’s, though the latter took the opposite view. For the war of 1914-
1918 Foch’s highly influential book may not have been dated but it was
dreadfully wrong, and it took a whole sea of blood to prove it. There is no
utility in reading Foch today, except to observe to what aberrant extremes
thinking in this field can go and how ill-considered can be the slogans that
guide the military policies of great nations. And, of course, reading it helps
one to understand the stupendous catastrophe that was the First World War.

organization especially of American forces and on the waging of great
campaigns in World War II, that of Giulio Douhet, is also today a museum
piece. The several essays usually gathered together under the name of the
most famous of them—Command of the Air—are brilliant, but they are also
narrow in outlook, dogmatic, and, as the Second World War proved, in all
their specific prescriptions altogether wrong. Air power enthusiasts refer to
Douhet reverently as the “prophet of air power,” and they will therefore
reject this appraisal, perhaps indignantly. But all they need do is read him
carefully, checking his detailed predictions against the experience of the
Second World War, which was the “war of the future” he was writing about.
He argued that battle lines on the ground would remain static and that the
decision would anyway be won by the nation’s bombers in just a few days.

Certainly that is not what happened. It is no doubt true that his ideas would
be more appropriate to nuclear weapons than they were to the bombs he had
in mind, but it is also true that the nuclear age hardly needs a Douhet to tell
it what havoc and terror can be achieved by these weapons. In any case, his
specific prescriptions would now be out of date. As with Foch’s book we
again have a body of work that has no utility today.

times as most of the literature specifically written about nuclear war.
Among works of the latter genre we pick up a good deal of useful
technological and other lore, but we usually sense also the absence of that
depth and scope which are particularly the hallmark of Clausewitz. We miss
especially his tough-minded pursuit of the idea that war in all its phases
must be rationally guided by meaningful political purposes. That insight is
quite lost in most of the contemporary books, including one which bears a
title that boldly invites comparison with the earlier classic, Herman Kahn’s
On Thermonuclear War. Kahn incidentally based his main argument—that
the United States could survive and therefore ought not too much fear a
thermonuclear war with its chief rival—on technical premises which are
certainly obsolete today, whether or not they were realistic when his book
was published in the not-so-distant year of 1060. Also, Kahn’s book does
not, as Clausewitz’s does, have much to say of relevance to the Vietnam
War which has intervened since and which caused the United States so
much soul-searching and agony, though far less of the latter than that borne
by the nation it set out to save. Kahn may still usefully supplement
Clausewitz, but only in a limited sense is he more timely, and he does not in
any way help to supplant him.

strategic thinking and writing that makes it different from other fields of
intellectual endeavor. In most other fields the works of older writers tend to
become outmoded because they are either absorbed or disproved. They are
sometimes interesting to read for historical reasons and often also for
various intrinsic qualities, but they are easily skipped without significant
penalty. I have mentioned the name of Darwin, who represents (as does
Freud in another field) the great discoverer, whose contribution is never
quite matched by any successor. But there is also the great innovator rather
than the discoverer, like Adam Smith, whose life span overlapped that of

Clausewitz and who wrote in a field remarkably akin to strategy in several
respects, including a preoccupation with efficiency in the use of resources
for specified goals and with solutions which are at least pragmatic, whether
or not they confirm laws describing invariable behavior.

His great seminal work The Wealth of Nations (1776) is generally

acknowledged to be the fountainhead of modern economics, owing
something to others but nevertheless marking a distinctive break with the
mercantilist tradition which preceded it and to which no economist worthy
of the name would thenceforward return. But this great work has had
mighty successors in the two centuries since its publication, and work in
this field continues today a most flourishing business, easily attracting its
due proportion of gifted minds. All of Smith’s essential contribution was
fully absorbed and further developed by later writers, who recognized their
indebtedness to him. Clausewitz, on the other hand, though he easily
compares in talent and innovation with an Adam Smith, has had no
comparable cavalcade of brilliant successors.

that is not observed in other fields, partly because those fields are far more
densely populated with eager workers and partly because of the
discontinuity of war itself. Also, while genius has scarcity value in every
field of human endeavor, in the field of strategic writing it has a special
rarity. The reason is that soldiers are rarely scholars, and civilians are rarely
students of strategy. Clausewitz’s genius is indisputable, and also in his
field unique.

We therefore find ourselves with at least two reasons why Clausewitz

continues to be worth the most careful study: first, he was striving always,
with a success that derived from his great gifts as well as his intense
capacity for work, to get to the fundamentals of each issue he examined,
beginning with the fundamental nature of war itself; and second, he is
virtually alone in his accomplishment. His is not simply the greatest but the
only truly great book on war. Where various other writers on that subject
seek to be analytical rather than simply historical, they may be highly
respectable in their achievements but as compared with Clausewitz the
invariable conclusion has to be that they do not come close.

One must so judge, for example, the work of Alfred Thayer Mahan, who

mostly historical. His dimensions and characteristics as a thinker are
reflected in his owning himself greatly indebted to Jomini but hardly at all
to the latter’s greater contemporary, Clausewitz. Another naval historian
and analyst contemporary with Mahan, Julian S. Corbett, did indeed pay
attention to the work of Clausewitz at great benefit to his own. We might
incidentally note, insofar as we are thinking of books being dated, that
though Mahan and Corbett lived and wrote in an age of essentially modern
steam warships, their writings, so tremendously influential especially in the
case of Mahan, develop doctrines deriving almost exclusively from naval
warfare in the days of sail.

what extent this factor detracts from the utility of reading Clausewitz today.
Obviously, to the military historian it will detract nothing at all but will
make the work, on the contrary, advantageous and indeed necessary to read.
If he wonders, for example, why the armies of Wellington and Blücher were
spread over so much territory when Napoleon came up to fight them in June
of 1815, he will gain some enlightenment from Chapter Thirteen of Book
Five, which happens to be on the subject of billets, and the description there
of that situation gains authority as well as clarity from the fact that
Clausewitz was then with the Prussian army and fought in two of the
ensuing battles. But much more than that, Clausewitz was himself a keen
military historian—On War represents less than a quarter of all his work
that ultimately found its way into print, and much of the rest is historical in
nature—and he was finely alert to the changes in military practices which
separated his own time from the generations preceding. Much of his shrewd
observation on these matters finds its way in highly condensed fashion into
the present work.

human race, and a small proportion even of those who might want to read
Clausewitz. However, anyone interested enough in what Clausewitz
represents to wish to read his book ought surely not be deterred by the fact
that one will in the process gain some insights into how war was fought in
his day. Our own generation is unique, but sadly so, in producing a school
of thinkers who are allegedly experts in military strategy and who are
certainly specialists in military studies but who know virtually nothing of
military history, including the history of our most recent wars, and who

seem not to care about their ignorance. Their skill in systems analysis and
related esoteric disciplines is undoubtedly of enormous value in helping
them to tread their way among the conflicting claims of the sellers and
proponents of different varieties of our extraordinarily complicated modern
weaponry. Yet the only empirical data we have about how people conduct
war and behave under its stresses is our experience with it in the past,
however much we have to make adjustments for subsequent changes in
conditions.

Until this new school developed in the period following the Second

World War, it was axiomatic that an intimate knowledge of its history was
indispensable to an understanding of war. Clausewitz believed it devoutly.
“Undoubtedly, the knowledge which is basic to the art of war,” he says (in
Chapter Six of Book Two), “is empirical.” And also, “Historical examples
make everything clear, and also provide the best kind of proof in the
empirical sciences.” Nor is he content with such generalizations, but instead
goes on to a careful and characteristically penetrating analysis of the ways
in which military history should be used to build up theory.

that Clausewitz died almost a century and a half ago as these lines are
written. This condition affects the present utility of his work in various
ways, the most obvious of which we have already mentioned. Clausewitz
himself asserts that the utility of an historical illustration is generally
inversely proportional to its age, and he announces that he will avoid in this
work examples antedating the War of the Austrian Succession, the
beginning of which in 1740 coincides with the beginning of the First
Silesian War and, more significantly, the accession of Frederick II, later
“the Great,” to the throne of Prussia. Thus, one finds throughout On War
hardly more than mention of another undoubted genius of war, the Duke of
Marlborough, and of his talented colleague, Prince Eugene of Savoy, who
collaborated in the brilliant campaign that ended with Blenheim only thirty-
six years before Frederick’s accession.

Gustavus Adolphus, confines himself in this work, with but rare exceptions,
to historical examples deriving from the seventy-five years ending with
Waterloo, which was the last battle he knew and which occurred sixteen
years before his death. He dwells on the extraordinarily significant changes

in the art of war that occurred during that period, and we cannot help
observing that those changes have to be compared to those which have
occurred since because of the vast technological revolution in warfare that
began about when he died. After all, the weaponry used in Frederick’s time
differed only slightly from that used in Napoleon’s, and to us it is
remarkable that very significant changes in practice could occur despite
insignificant changes in arms, not to mention transportation or
communication.

double disadvantage for us, first, that even the latest of it is so far removed
from us in time and condition that Clausewitz by his own standards of
acceptance would not have considered it, and second, largely because of
that remoteness, exceedingly few of his readers will have any prior
knowledge at all of the many campaigns or battles he refers to. One
supposes that everyone knows something about Napoleon’s invasion of
Russia in 1812. Tschaikovsky wrote a popular overture about it and Tolstoy
a very great novel, and the latter work has been made into several movies
and a television series. But who today besides a few specialists knows
anything about the campaigns of Frederick, or for that matter about most of
the other campaigns of Napoleon?

Fortunately, in his use of an historical example Clausewitz often

reconstructs enough about it to give us an adequate picture of what went on
and its relevance to the point he is making. But often he does not. We must,
therefore, admit that simply from the expository point of view, we lose a
great deal of the richness of his analysis as it must have presented itself to
his contemporaries. Naturally, we can take steps to amend this shortcoming
by learning something of the history he utilizes—a far less severe burden
than, say, learning Greek in order to enjoy the poems of Sappho—but in the
net we have to write this factor off as a debit.

There is indeed an obverse side to this issue. War, as Clausewitz asserts

in one place, is different from anything else. Thus, however much it may
change within itself from one era to another, its essential character remains
distinct from every other pursuit of man. By the same token, it is not in vain
that we seek certain elemental qualities which change very little if at all. We
are not speaking of the “unchanging principles” of Jomini but of something
more fundamental. This element touches basically on why we read

Clausewitz, who comes closer to revealing those fundamentals to us than
does anyone else, but it also affects the matter of his historical examples.

knowledge and personal experience he may possess an example to test
whether the point in question remains valid, or at least whether it still
applied to a much later time than Clausewitz’s. Thus where the latter,
drawing examples from the campaigns of Frederick and of Napoleon,
concedes that there are exceptions to the rule of concentration (which
otherwise he most strongly supports) and suggests that there are times when
a commander should divide his forces in the presence of the enemy, one can
reflect on how brilliantly Lee did so at Chancellorsville or how Admiral
William F. Halsey foolishly failed to do so at Leyte Gulf. And there is a
thrill of discovery in seeing suddenly leaping out at one, in the very last
chapter of the work, a pattern of ideas which must certainly have provided
the conceptual inspiration for the military aspects of the famous Schlieffen
Plan. One may remember too that Count von Schlieffen was sufficiently a
student of Clausewitz to have absorbed the latter’s repeated maxims about
not letting the political end be dominated by the military objective, for he is
on record as having urged in writing that if the Plan should fail, as of course
it did in 1914, Germany should at once seek a negotiated peace.
Unfortunately for Germany and for the world, this most basic of the
Clausewitzian ideas was discarded by the successors of Schlieffen and of
the younger von Moltke. The Schlieffen Plan, to be sure, had an enormous
built-in defect of its own which was basically anti-Clausewitzian—that is,
the requirement for the invasion of Belgium (originally also Holland),
which was bound to bring Britain into the war.

It is for any student of war, or of politics, a never-ending exercise, in

reading of some older problems and how they were handled, to make
adjustments to later times. It soon becomes automatic, because it really
presents few serious intellectual difficulties. Some ideas and admonitions
are immediately recognized as still pertaining today, others as being useful
only for the better understanding of military or political history.

More troublesome, admittedly, than the question of mere examples are

those quite long stretches where Clausewitz discusses methods of marching,
provisioning, and the like that belong to a vanished past. This does not
apply to all of Books Four to Seven inclusive, but it applies to much that is

found within those books. Over these stretches one’s reading may tend to
speed up somewhat—perhaps a little warning will help one in
accomplishing the acceleration—but one would have to be very pressed for
time to want to skip them entirely. In these passages the author shares with
us his great knowledge of the conduct of campaigns in his own time, and he
is at some pains to make us aware of certain important changes from earlier
times. Various abbreviated editions have omitted some of these sections, but
it is no doubt best to let the reader decide for himself whether or not he
desires to accompany so great a master into these areas. All too little of
what Clausewitz wrote has been published in English translation, and few
of us would want to see his masterwork truncated. Besides, the reader will
find that even in the most unlikely pages he will encounter some sage and
penetrating observations that are characteristically Clausewitzian and that
apply as much to our own day as they did to his.

Apart from the question of obsolescence or datedness, there are other

characteristics of Clausewitz which, though they may be virtues rather than
defects, militate against recognition of his genius and accomplishment.
Chief among these is his pronounced disinclination to provide formulas or
axioms as guides to action. He is often intent upon demonstrating the
pitfalls of such axioms, which is the quality chiefly distinguishing him from
Jomini, as well as from virtually all his successors. That is one of the chief
reasons why military people are so often disappointed with Clausewitz, for
they are particularly accustomed in their training to absorbing against a
tight schedule of time specific rules for conduct, a practice reflected in their
broad use of the term “indoctrination.” Clausewitz, on the contrary, invites
his readers to ruminate with him on the complex nature of war, where any
rule that admits of no exceptions is usually too obvious to be worth much
discourse.

This quality is seen especially in his attitude toward such notions as were

already beginning to be called “principles of war.” Though he could hardly
avoid establishing certain generalizations, which is inevitably the result and
the purpose of analytical study, he specifically and vehemently rejected the
notion that the conduct of war can reasonably be guided by a small number
of pithy axioms. It was Jomini, not Clausewitz, who has been responsible
for the endlessly quoted remark that “methods change but principles are
unchanging,” and it is largely for that reason that Jomini had far the greater

influence on military thinking in his own and later times, at least among
non-Germans. It was Jomini who was looked to for guidance by both sides
in the American Civil War, which in his very long life he lived to see
concluded. And, as we have seen, it was Jomini whom Mahan called “my
best military friend.”

American) field manuals began attempting to encapsulate centuries of
experience and volumes of reflection into a few tersely worded and usually
numbered “principles of war,” such as the “principle of concentration,” the
“principle of economy of force,” the “principle of surprise,” and so forth.
Though books have been written to explain and elaborate these principles,
the main emphasis has been on keeping them lean and taut—to make them
more readily communicated in a few days of a war college course by
whoever happened to be assigned as an instructor for the purpose, and also
more easily carried into combat situations. Clausewitz would have been
appalled at such attempts, and not surprised at some of the terrible blunders
that have been perpetrated in the name of those “principles.” Some who in
his own time attempted comparable things he called “the scribblers of
systems and compendia.”

rumination, sometimes in pages most densely packed with sharp insights, is
a commitment to be responsive. This requires a different kind of reading
from what we are normally accustomed to. In our time training courses are
given to increase reading speed, and no one doubts the benefit of speedy
reading with respect to the great masses of stuff that almost any
professional person has to cover. With Clausewitz, however, one should be
prepared to tarry, to pause frequently for reflection. Clausewitz’s basic wish
about his book, though no modest one, will reward anyone who does so.

On War

AUTHOR’S PREFACE

To an Unpublished Manuscript on the Theory of War, Written

between 1816 and 1818

 
There is no need today to labor the point that a scientific approach does not
consist solely, or even mainly, in a complete system and a comprehensive
doctrine. In the formal sense the present work contains no such system;
instead of a complete theory it offers only material for one.

Its scientific character consists in an attempt to investigate the essence of

the phenomena of war and to indicate the links between these phenomena
and the nature of their component parts. No logical conclusion has been
avoided; but whenever the thread became too thin I have preferred to break
it off and go back to the relevant phenomena of experience. just as some
plants bear fruit only if they don’t shoot up too high, so in the practical arts
the leaves and flowers of theory must be pruned and the plant kept close to
its proper soil—experience.

It would obviously be a mistake to determine the form of an ear of wheat

by analyzing the chemical elements of its kernel, since all one needs to do is
to go to a wheat field to see the grown ears. Analysis and observation,
theory and experience must never disdain or exclude each other; on the
contrary, they support each other. The propositions of this book therefore,
like short spans of an arch, base their axioms on the secure foundation
either of experience or the nature of war as such, and are thus adequately
buttressed.75

full of intelligence and substance; but the theories we presently possess are
very different. Quite apart from their unscientific spirit, they try so hard to
make their systems coherent and complete that they are stuffed with
commonplaces, truisms, and nonsense of every kind. An accurate
impression of their character can be gained by reading Lichtenberg’s
“Extract from a Fire Regulation”:

house on the left, and on the other hand the left wall of the house on the
right. For if, for example, one were to try and protect the left wall of the
house on the left, one must remember that the right wall of the house is on
the right of its left wall, and thus, since the fire is also to the right of this
wall and of the right wall (for we have assumed that the house is on the left
of the fire) the right wall is closer to the fire than the left, and the right wall
of the house could burn down if it were not protected before the fire would
reach the left, protected wall; consequently something could burn down that
was not protected, and sooner than something else, even if this something
else was also unprotected; consequently the latter must be left alone and the
former must be protected. To fix the point firmly in mind, one need only
remember: if the house is to the right of the fire, it is the left wall that
matters; and if the house is on the left, it is the right wall.”

wisdom, or spoil the taste of the little good he has to offer by watering it
down. Years of thinking about war, much association with able men who
knew war, and a good deal of personal experience with it, have left him
with certain ideas and convictions, and these he has preferred to present in
compressed form, like small nuggets of pure metal. That is how the
chapters of this book took shape, only tentatively linked on the surface, but
I hope not without internal consistency. Perhaps a greater mind will soon
appear to replace these individual nuggets with a single whole, cast of solid
metal, free from all impurity.

AUTHOR’S COMMENT

On the Genesis of his Early Manuscript on the Theory of War,

Written around 181876

 
The statements set down here deal with what in my opinion are the major
elements of strategy. I regarded them as early drafts, and had more or less
reached the point of fusing them into a single work.

These drafts did not follow any preliminary plan. My original intention

was to set down my conclusions on the principal elements of this topic in
short, precise, compact statements, without concern for system or formal
connection. The manner in which Montesquieu dealt with his subject was
vaguely in my mind. I thought that such concise, aphoristic chapters, which
at the outset I simply wanted to call kernels, would attract the intelligent
reader by what they suggested as much as by what they expressed; in other
words, I had an intelligent reader in mind, who was already familiar with
the subject. But my nature, which always drives me to develop and
systematize, at last asserted itself here as well. From the studies I wrote on
various topics in order to gain a clear and complete understanding of them,
I managed for a time to lift only the most important conclusions and thus
concentrate their essence in smaller compass. But eventually my tendency
completely ran away with me; I elaborated as much as I could, and of
course now had in mind a reader who was not yet acquainted with the
subject.

The more I wrote and surrendered to the spirit of analysis, the more I

reverted to a systematic approach, and so one chapter after another was
added.

In the end I intended to revise it all again, strengthen the causal

connections in the earlier essays, perhaps in the later ones draw together
several analyses into a single conclusion, and thus produce a reasonable
whole, which would form a small volume in octavo. But here too, I wanted
at all costs to avoid every commonplace, everything obvious that has been
stated a hundred times and is generally believed. It was my ambition to

write a book that would not be forgotten after two or three years, and that
possibly might be picked up more than once by those who are interested in
the subject.

PREFACE

By Marie von Clausewitz to the Posthumous Edition of Her

Husband’s Works, Including On War

 
Readers will be rightly surprised that a woman should dare to write a
preface for such a work as this. My friends will need no explanation; but I
hope that a simple account of the circumstances that caused me to take this
step will remove any impression of presumptuousness in the minds of those
who do not know me.

The work which these lines precede occupied my inexpressively beloved

husband almost completely for the last twelve years of his life. His father-
land and I unfortunately lost him far too early. To complete his work was
his dearest wish, but it was not his intention to communicate it to the world
during his lifetime. When I would try to dissuade him from this decision, he
often responded, half jokingly, but perhaps also with a presentiment of his
early death: “You shall publish it.” These words (which in happier days
often caused me tears, even though I scarcely took them seriously) oblige
me in the view of my friends to introduce the posthumous works of my
beloved husband with a few lines. Even though readers may have differing
opinions on this point, they will surely not misinterpret the emotion that has
caused me to overcome the timidity which makes it so difficult for a woman
to appear before the reading public even in the most subordinate manner.

It goes without saying that I have no intention whatever of regarding

myself as the true editor of a work that is far beyond my intellectual
horizon. Only as a sympathetic companion do I want to help its entry into
the world. I may claim this role since I was granted a similar function in the
creation and development of the work. Those who knew of our happy
marriage and knew that we shared everything, not only joy and pain but
also every occupation, every concern of daily life, will realize that a task of
this kind could not occupy my beloved husband without at the same time
becoming thoroughly familiar to me. For the same reason no one can testify
as well as I to the energy and love with which he dedicated himself to the
task, the hopes he associated with it, and the manner and time of its

creation. From early youth his richly endowed mind had felt the need for
light and truth, and while he was broadly educated, his reflections were
directed primarily toward military affairs, which are of such great
importance to the well-being of nations and which constituted his
profession. Scharnhorst first showed him the right course; his appointment
as teacher at the General War College, as well as the simultaneous honor of
being chosen to introduce His Royal Highness the Crown Prince to the
study of war, gave him additional reasons for directing his research and
efforts toward these matters, as well as to set down his findings in writing.
An essay with which he concluded the instruction of His Royal Highness
the Crown Prince in 1812 already contains the seeds of his later works. But
it was not until 1816, in Coblenz, that he again took up his scholarly work
and began to gather the fruit that had ripened in the course of his rich
experiences during four significant years of warfare. To begin with he
developed his views in brief essays only loosely connected with each other.
The following undated note, which was among his papers, seems to belong
to that early stage: [See “Author’s Comment,” p. 63 above].

now and then to his private studies. Not until 1818 when he was appointed
Director of the General War College in Berlin did he acquire enough time to
expand his work, and further enrich it with the historical interpretation of
the more recent wars. This new leisure also reconciled him to his
assignment, which in other respects could not quite satisfy him, since under
the present arrangements of the college its educational program is not the
Director’s responsibility but is guided by a separate commission of studies.
Free as he was of any petty vanity, of restless egotism and ambition, he
nevertheless felt the need to be truly useful, and not let his God-given
abilities go to waste. In his professional life he did not occupy a position
that could satisfy this need, and he had little hope that he would ever reach
such a position. Consequently, all his efforts were directed toward the realm
of scientific understanding, and the benefits that he hoped would result
from his work became his purpose in life. If in spite of this he was ever
more determined not to have his work published until after his death, it
must be the best proof that no vain desire for praise and recognition, no
trace of egotistic motive, mingled with this noble urge for great and lasting
influence.

transferred to the artillery. His energies were now taken up for a different
purpose, and to such an extent that at least for the moment he had to
renounce all literary work. He arranged his papers, sealed and labeled the
individual packages, and sadly bade farewell to an activity that had come to
mean so much to him. In August of that year he was transferred to Breslau,
where he was assigned to head the 2d Artillery Inspection; but already in
December he was recalled to Berlin and appointed chief of staff to Field
Marshal Count Gneisenau (for the duration of the latter’s command [in the
East]). In March 18031 he accompanied his admired commander-in-chief to
Posen. When he returned to Breslau in November, having suffered the most
painful loss [in Gneisenau’s death], he was cheered by the hope of resuming
his work, and possibly completing it in the course of the winter. God
decided otherwise. He returned to Breslau on 7 November, on the sixteenth
he died, and the packages that his hand had sealed were not opened until
after his death!

These literary remains are published in the following volumes, exactly as

they were found, without one word being added or deleted. Nevertheless
their publication called for a good deal of work, arranging of material, and
consultation, and I am profoundly grateful to several loyal friends for their
assistance in these tasks. Above all I must name Major O’Etzel, who was
kind enough to read the proofs and to draw the maps that will accompany
the historical sections of the edition. I also take the liberty of mentioning
my beloved brother, my support in times of trial, who rendered so many
different services in preparing the manuscripts for publication. Among
others, in the course of careful checking and sorting the material he found
the beginnings of the revision that my beloved husband mentions as a future
project in the Note of 1827, printed below. The revisions have been inserted
in those parts of Book I for which they were intended (they did not go
further).

I want to thank many other friends for their advice and for the sympathy

and affection they have shown me; though I cannot name them all, they will
surely not doubt my warmest gratitude. This gratitude is the greater since I
am firmly convinced that everything they have done was done not only for
me but also for the friend whom God took from them so prematurely.

Treasured memories, hopes, the rich inheritance of sympathy and friendship
that I owe to the beloved departed, and the elevating sense that his rare
distinction is so generally and nobly recognized sustain this happiness
despite my irreplaceable loss.

The trust that led a noble prince and princess to call me to their side is a

new favor for which I thank God.77 It has given me a new and valued task,
to which I dedicate myself gladly. May this task be blessed, and may the
cherished little prince, who is presently entrusted to my care, someday read
this book, and be inspired by it to deeds similar to the deeds of his glorious
ancestors!

Two Notes by the Author on His Plans for Revising On War

NOTE OF 10 JULY 1827

 
I regard the first six books, which are already in a clean copy, merely as a
rather formless mass that must be thoroughly reworked once more. The
revision will bring out the two types of war with greater clarity at every
point. All ideas will then become plainer, their general trend will be more
clearly marked, their application shown in greater detail.

War can be of two kinds, in the sense that either the objective is to

overthrow the enemy—to render him politically helpless or militarily
impotent, thus forcing him to sign whatever peace we please; or merely to
occupy some of his frontier-districts so that we can annex them or use them
for bargaining at the peace negotiations. Transitions from one type to the
other will of course recur in my treatment; but the fact that the aims of the
two types are quite different must be clear at all times, and their points of
irreconcilability brought out.

This distinction between the two kinds of war is a matter of actual fact.

But no less practical is the importance of another point that must be made
absolutely clear, namely that war is nothing but the continuation of policy
with other means. If this is firmly kept in mind throughout it will greatly
facilitate the study of the subject and the whole will be easier to analyze.
Although the main application of this point will not be made until Book
Eight, it must be developed in Book One and will play its part in the
revision of the first six books. That revision will also rid the first six books
of a good deal of superfluous material, fill in various gaps, large and small,
and make a number of generalities more precise in thought and form.

Book Seven, “On Attack” (various chapters of which are already in

rough draft) should be regarded as the counterpart of Book Six, “On
Defense,” and is the next to be revised in accordance with the clear insights
indicated above. Thereafter it will need no further revision; indeed, it will
then provide a standard for revising the first six books.

Book Eight, “War-Plans,” will deal with the organization of a war as a

whole. Several chapters of it have already been drafted, but they must not in

any sense be taken as being in final form. They are really no more than a
rough working over of the raw material, done with the idea that the labor
itself would show what the real problems were. That in fact is what
happened, and when I have finished Book Seven I shall go on at once and
work out Book Eight in full. My main concern will be to apply the two
principles mentioned above, with the idea of refining and simplifying
everything. In Book Eight I also hope to iron out a good many kinks in the
minds of strategists and statesmen and at all events to show what the whole
thing is about and what the real problems are that have to be taken into
account in actual warfare.

really establishing the main features of war it will be all the easier for me to
apply the same criteria to the first six books and make those features
evident throughout them. Only when I have reached that point, therefore,
shall I take the revision of the first six books in hand.

would, of course only deserve to be called a shapeless mass of ideas. Being
liable to endless misinterpretation it would be the target of much half-baked
criticism, for in matters of this kind everyone feels he is justified in writing
and publishing the first thing that comes into his head when he picks up a
pen, and thinks his own ideas as axiomatic as the fact that two and two
make four. If critics would go to the trouble of thinking about the subject
for years on end and testing each conclusion against the actual history of
war, as I have done, they would undoubtedly be more careful of what they
said.

understanding will recognize the fact that the first six books, for all their
imperfection of form, contain the fruit of years of reflection on war and
diligent study of it. He may even find they contain the basic ideas that
might bring about a revolution in the theory of war.

UNFINISHED NOTE, PRESUMABLY WRITTEN IN 1830

 
The manuscript on the conduct of major operations that will be found after
my death can, in its present state, be regarded as nothing but a collection of
materials from which a theory of war was to have been distilled. I am still
dissatisfied with most of it, and can call Book Six only a sketch. I intended
to rewrite it entirely and to try and find a solution along other lines.

Nevertheless I believe the main ideas which will be seen to govern this

material are the right ones, looked at in the light of actual warfare. They are
the outcome of wide-ranging study: I have thoroughly checked them against
real life and have constantly kept in mind the lessons derived from my
experience and from association with distinguished soldiers.

Book Seven, which I have sketched in outline, was meant to deal with

“Attack,” and Book Eight with “War-Plans,” in which I intended to concern
myself particularly with war in its political and human aspects.

The first chapter of Book One alone I regard as finished. It will at least

serve the whole by indicating the direction I meant to follow everywhere.

The theory of major operations (strategy, as it is called) presents

extraordinary difficulties, and it is fair to say that very few people have
clear ideas about its details—that is, ideas which logically derive from basic
necessities. Most men merely act on instinct, and the amount of success
they achieve depends on the amount of talent they were born with.

All great commanders have acted on instinct, and the fact that their

instinct was always sound is partly the measure of their innate greatness and
genius. So far as action is concerned this will always be the case and
nothing more is needed. Yet when it is not a question of acting oneself but
of persuading others in discussion, the need is for clear ideas and the ability
to show their connection with each other. So few people have yet acquired
the necessary skill at this that most discussions are a futile bandying of
words; either they leave each man sticking to his own ideas or they end
with everyone agreeing, for the sake of agreement, on a compromise with
nothing to be said for it.

human mind, moreover, has a universal thirst for clarity, and longs to feel
itself part of an orderly scheme of things.

It is a very difficult task to construct a scientific theory for the art of war,

and so many attempts have failed that most people say it is impossible,
since it deals with matters that no permanent law can provide for. One
would agree, and abandon the attempt, were it not for the obvious fact that a
whole range of propositions can be demonstrated without difficulty: that
defense is the stronger form of fighting with the negative purpose, attack
the weaker form with the positive purpose; that major successes help bring
about minor ones, so that strategic results can be traced back to certain
turning-points; that a demonstration is a weaker use of force than a real
attack, and that it must therefore be clearly justified; that victory consists
not only in the occupation of the battlefield, but in the destruction of the
enemy’s physical and psychic forces, which is usually not attained until the
enemy is pursued after a victorious battle; that success is always greatest at
the point where the victory was gained, and that consequently changing
from one line of operations, one direction, to another can at best be
regarded as a necessary evil; that a turning movement can only be justified
by general superiority or by having better lines of communication or retreat
than the enemy’s; that flank-positions are governed bv the same
consideration; that every attack loses impetus as it progresses.

1. INTRODUCTION

2. DEFINITION

War is thus an act of force to compels our enemy to do our will.
Force, to counter opposing force, equips itself with the inventions of art

and science. Attached to force are certain self-imposed, imperceptible
limitations hardly worth mentioning, known as international law and
custom, but they scarcely weaken it. Force—that is, physical force, for
moral force has no existence save as expressed in the state and the law—is
thus the means of war; to impose our will on the enemy is its object. To
secure that object we must render the enemy powerless; and that, in theory,
is the true aim of warfare. That aim takes the place of the object, discarding
it as something not actually part of war itself.

OceanofPDF.com

3. THE MAXIMUM USE OF FORCE

This is how the matter must be seen. It would be futile—even wrong—to

try and shut one’s eyes to what war really is from sheer distress at its
brutality.

If wars between civilized nations are far less cruel and destructive than

wars between savages, the reason lies in the social conditions of the states
themselves and in their relationships to one another. These are the forces
that give rise to war; the same forces circumscribe and moderate it. They
themselves however are not part of war; they already exist before fighting
starts. To introduce the principle of moderation into the theory of war itself
would always lead to logical absurdity.

Two different motives make men fight one another: hostile feelings and

hostile intentions. Our definition is based on the latter, since it is the
universal element. Even the most savage, almost instinctive, passion of
hatred cannot be conceived as existing without hostile intent; but hostile
intentions are often unaccompanied by any sort of hostile feelings—at least
by none that predominate. Savage peoples are ruled by passion, civilized
peoples by the mind. The difference, however, lies not in the respective
natures of savagery and civilization, but in their attendant circumstances,
institutions, and so forth. The difference, therefore, does not operate in

every case, but it does in most of them. Even the most civilized of peoples,
in short, can be fired with passionate hatred for each other.

civilized peoples as resulting merely from a rational act on the part of their
governments and to conceive of war as gradually ridding itself of passion,
so that in the end one would never really need to use the physical impact of
the fighting forces——comparative figures of their strength would be
enough. That would be a kind of war by algebra.

recent wars taught them a lesson. If war is an act of force, the emotions
cannot fail to be involved. War may not spring from them, but they will still
affect it to some degree, and the extent to which they do so will depend not
on the level of civilization but on how important the conflicting interests are
and on how long their conflict lasts.

cities and countries, it is because intelligence plays a larger part in their
methods of warfare and has taught them more effective ways of using force
than the crude expression of instinct.

The invention of gunpowder and the constant improvement of firearms

are enough in themselves to show that the advance of civilization has done
nothing practical to alter or deflect the impulse to destroy the enemy, which
is central to the very idea of war.

The thesis, then, must be repeated: war is an act of force, and there is no

logical limit to the application of that force. Each side, therefore, compels
its opponent to follow suit; a reciprocal action is started which must lead, in
theory, to extremes. This is the first case of interaction and the first
“extreme” we meet with.

OceanofPDF.com

4. THE AIM IS TO DISARM THE ENEMY

War, however, is not the action of a living force upon a lifeless mass

(total nonresistance would be no war at all) but always the collision of two
living forces. The ultimate aim of waging war, as formulated here, must be
taken as applying to both sides. Once again, there is interaction. So long as I
have not overthrown my opponent I am bound to fear he may overthrow
me. Thus I am not in control: he dictates to me as much as I dictate to him.
This is the second case of interaction and it leads to the second “extreme.”

5. THE MAXIMUM EXERTION OF STRENGTH

6. MODIFICATIONS IN PRACTICE

Even assuming this extreme effort to be an absolute quantity that could

easily be calculated, one must admit that the human mind is unlikely to
consent to being ruled by such a logical fantasy. It would often result in
strength being wasted, which is contrary to other principles of statecraft. An
effort of will out of all proportion to the object in view would be needed but
would not in fact be realized, since subtleties of logic do not motivate the
human will.

But move from the abstract to the real world, and the whole thing looks

quite different. In the abstract world, optimism was all-powerful and forced
us to assume that both parties to the conflict not only sought perfection but
attained it. Would this ever be the case in practice? Yes, it would if: (a) war
were a wholly isolated act, occurring suddenly and not produced by
previous events in the political world; (b) it consisted of a single decisive
act or a set of simultaneous ones; (c) the decision achieved was complete
and perfect in itself, uninfluenced by any previous estimate of the political
situation it would bring about.

7. WAR IS NEVER AN ISOLATED ACT

OceanofPDF.com

8. WAR DOES NOT CONSIST OF A SINGLE SHORT BLOW

If war consisted of one decisive act, or of a set of simultaneous decisions,

preparations would tend toward totality, for no omission could ever be
rectified. The sole criterion for preparations which the world of reality
could provide would be the measures taken by the adversary—so far as they
are known; the rest would once more be reduced to abstract calculations.
But if the decision in war consists of several successive acts, then each of
them, seen in context, will provide a gauge for those that follow. Here
again, the abstract world is ousted by the real one and the trend to the
extreme is thereby moderated.

But, of course, if all the means available were, or could be,

simultaneously employed, all wars would automatically be confined to a
single decisive act or a set of simultaneous ones—the reason being that any
adverse decision must reduce the sum of the means available, and if all had
been committed in the first act there could really be no question of a
second. Any subsequent military operation would virtually be part of the
first—in other words, merely an extension of it.

Yet, as I showed above, as soon as preparations for a war begin, the

world of reality takes over from the world of abstract thought; material
calculations take the place of hypothetical extremes and, if for no other
reason, the interaction of the two sides tends to fall short of maximum
effort. Their full resources will therefore not be mobilized immediately.

Besides, the very nature of those resources and of their employment

means they cannot all be deployed at the same moment. The resources in
question are the fighting forces proper, the country, with its physical
features and population, and its allies.

The country—its physical features and population—is more than just the

source of all armed forces proper; it is in itself an integral element among

the factors at work in war—though only that part which is the actual theater
of operations or has a notable influence on it.

but with fortresses, rivers, mountains, inhabitants, and so forth, that cannot
be done; not, in short, with the country as a whole, unless it is so small that
the opening action of the war completely engulfs it. Furthermore, allies do
not cooperate at the mere desire of those who are actively engaged in
fighting; international relations being what they are, such cooperation is
often furnished only at some later stage or increased only when a balance
has been disturbed and needs correction.

In many cases, the proportion of the means of resistance that cannot

immediately be brought to bear is much higher than might at first be
thought. Even when great strength has been expended on the first decision
and the balance has been badly upset, equilibrium can be restored. The
point will be more fully treated in due course. At this stage it is enough to
show that the very nature of war impedes the simultaneous concentration of
all forces. To be sure, that fact in itself cannot be grounds for making any
but a maximum effort to obtain the first decision, for a defeat is always a
disadvantage no one would deliberately risk. And even if the first clash is
not the only one, the influence it has on subsequent actions will be on a
scale proportionate to its own. But it is contrary to human nature to make an
extreme effort, and the tendency therefore is always to plead that a decision
may be possible later on. As a result, for the first decision, effort and
concentration of forces are not all they might be. Anything omitted out of
weakness by one side becomes a real, objective reason for the other to
reduce its efforts, and the tendency toward extremes is once again reduced
by this interaction.

11. THE POLITICAL OBJECT NOW COMES TO THE

FORE AGAIN

The political object—the original motive for the war—will thus

determine both the military objective to be reached and the amount of effort
it requires. The political object cannot, however, in itself provide the
standard of measurement. Since we are dealing with realities, not with
abstractions, it can do so only in the context of the two states at war. The
same political object can elicit differing reactions from different peoples,
and even from the same people at different times. We can therefore take the
political object as a standard only if we think of the influence it can exert
upon the forces it is meant to move. The nature of those forces therefore
calls for study. Depending on whether their characteristics increase or
diminish the drive toward a particular action, the outcome will vary.
Between two peoples and two states there can be such tensions, such a mass
of inflammable material, that the slightest quarrel can produce a wholly
disproportionate effect—a real explosion.

This is equally true of the efforts a political object is expected to arouse

in either state, and of the military objectives which their policies require.
Sometimes the political and military objective is the same—for example,
the conquest of a province. In other cases the political object will not
provide a suitable military objective. In that event, another military
objective must be adopted that will serve the political purpose and
symbolize it in the peace negotiations. But here, too, attention must be paid
to the character of each state involved. There are times when, if the political
object is to be achieved, the substitute must be a good deal more important.
The less involved the population and the less serious the strains within
states and between them, the more political requirements in themselves will
dominate and tend to be decisive. Situations can thus exist in which the
political object will almost be the sole determinant.

Generally speaking, a military objective that matches the political object

in scale will, if the latter is reduced, be reduced in proportion; this will be
all the more so as the political object increases its predominance. Thus it
follows that without any inconsistency wars can have all degrees of
importance and intensity, ranging from a war of extermination down to
simple armed observation. This brings us to a different question, which now
needs to be analyzed and answered.

12. AN INTERRUPTION OF MILITARY ACTIVITY IS NOT

EXPLAINED BY ANYTHING YET SAID

Every action needs a certain time to be completed. That period is called

its duration, and its length will depend on the speed with which the person
acting works. We need not concern ourselves with the difference here.
Everyone performs a task in his own way; a slow man, however, does not
do it more slowly because he wants to spend more time over it, but because
his nature causes him to need more time. If he made more haste he would
do the job less well. His speed, then, is determined by subjective causes and
is a factor in the actual duration of the task.

Now if every action in war is allowed its appropriate duration, we would

agree that, at least at first sight, any additional expenditure of time—any
suspension of military action—seems absurd. In this connection it must be
remembered that what we are talking about is not the progress made by one
side or the other but the progress of military interaction as a whole.

OceanofPDF.com

13. ONLY ONE CONSIDERATION CAN SUSPEND

MILITARY ACTION, AND IT SEEMS THAT IT CAN
NEVER BE PRESENT ON MORE THAN ONE SIDE

But an absolute balance of forces cannot bring about a standstill, for if

such a balance should exist the initiative would necessarily belong to the
side with the positive purpose—the attacker.

One could, however, conceive of a state of balance in which the side with

the positive aim (the side with the stronger grounds for action) was the one
that had the weaker forces. The balance would then result from the
combined effects of aim and strength. Were that the case, one would have to
say that unless some shift in the balance were in prospect the two sides
should make peace. If, however, some alteration were to be foreseen, only
one side could expect to gain by it—a fact which ought to stimulate the
other into action. Inaction clearly cannot be explained by the concept of
balance. The only explanation is that both are waiting for a better time to
act. Let us suppose, therefore, that one of the two states has a positive aim
—say, the conquest of a part of the other’s territory, to use for bargaining at
the peace table. Once the prize is in its hands, the political object has been
achieved; there is no need to do more, and it can let matters rest. If the other
state is ready to accept the situation, it should sue for peace. If not, it must
do something; and if it thinks it will be better organized for action in four
weeks’ time it clearly has an adequate reason for not taking action at once.

other side—the object being to deny the enemy the time he needs for
getting ready. Throughout all this I have assumed, of course, that both sides
understand the situation perfectly.

14. CONTINUITY WOULD THUS BE BROUGHT ABOUT
IN MILITARY ACTION AND WOULD AGAIN INTENSIFY

EVERYTHING

But war, of course, seldom if ever shows such continuity. In numerous

conflicts only a very small part of the time is occupied by action, while the
rest is spent in inactivity. This cannot always be an anomaly. Suspension of
action in war must be possible; in other words, it is not a contradiction in
terms. Let me demonstrate this point, and explain the reasons for it.

OceanofPDF.com

15. HERE A PRINCIPLE OF POLARITY IS PROPOSED

The principle of polarity is valid only in relation to one and the same

object, in which positive and negative interests exactly cancel one another
out. In a battle each side aims at victory; that is a case of true polarity, since
the victory of one side excludes the victory of the other. When, however, we
are dealing with two different things that have a common relation external
to themselves, the polarity lies not in the things but in their relationship.

OceanofPDF.com

16. ATTACK AND DEFENSE BEING THINGS DIFFERENT

IN KIND AND UNEQUAL IN STRENGTH, POLARITY

CANNOT BE APPLIED TO THEM

But there are two distinct forms of action in war: attack and defense. As

will be shown in detail later, the two are very different and unequal in
strength. Polarity, then, does not lie in attack or defense, but in the object
both seek to achieve: the decision. If one commander wants to postpone the
decision, the other must want to hasten it, always assuming that both are
engaged in the same kind of fighting. If it is in A’s interest not to attack B
now but to attack him in four weeks, then it is in B’s interest not to be
attacked in four weeks’ time, but now. This is an immediate and direct
conflict of interest; but it does not follow from this that it would also be to
B’s advantage to make an immediate attack on A. That would obviously be
quite another matter.

OceanofPDF.com

17. THE SUPERIORITY OF DEFENSE OVER ATTACK
OFTEN DESTROYS THE EFFECT OF POLARITY, AND

THIS EXPLAINS THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY

ACTION

Consequently, if the side favored by present conditions is not sufficiently

strong to do without the added advantages of the defense, it will have to
accept the prospect of acting under unfavorable conditions in the future. To
fight a defensive battle under these less favorable conditions may still be
better than to attack immediately or to make peace. I am convinced that the
superiority of the defensive (if rightly understood) is very great, far greater
than appears at first sight. It is this which explains without any
inconsistency most periods of inaction that occur in war. The weaker the
motives for action, the more will they be overlaid and neutralized by this
disparity between attack and defense, and the more frequently will action be
suspended—as indeed experience shows.

OceanofPDF.com

18. A SECOND CAUSE IS IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF

THE SITUATION

The possibility of inaction has a further moderating effect on the progress

of the war by diluting it, so to speak, in time by delaying danger, and by
increasing the means of restoring a balance between the two sides. The
greater the tensions that have led to war, and the greater the consequent war
effort, the shorter these periods of inaction. Inversely, the weaker the motive
for conflict, the longer the intervals between actions. For the stronger
motive increases willpower, and willpower, as we know, is always both an
element in and the product of strength.

In short, absolute, so-called mathematical, factors never find a firm basis

in military calculations. From the very start there is an interplay of
possibilities, probabilities, good luck and bad that weaves its way
throughout the length and breadth of the tapestry. In the whole range of
human activities, war most closely resembles a game of cards.

22. HOW IN GENERAL THIS BEST SUITS HUMAN

NATURE

often finds uncertainty fascinating. It prefers to day-dream in the realms of
chance and luck rather than accompany the intellect on its narrow and
tortuous path of philosophical enquiry and logical deduction only to arrive
—hardly knowing how—in unfamiliar surroundings where all the usual
landmarks seem to have disappeared. Unconfined by narrow necessity, it
can revel in a wealth of possibilities; which inspire courage to take wing
and dive into the element of daring and danger like a fearless swimmer into
the current.

Should theory leave us here, and cheerfully go on elaborating absolute

conclusions and prescriptions? Then it would be no use at all in real life.
No, it must also take the human factor into account, and find room for
courage, boldness, even foolhardiness. The art of war deals with living and
with moral forces. Consequently, it cannot attain the absolute, or certainty;
it must always leave a margin for uncertainty, in the greatest things as much
as in the smallest. With uncertainty in one scale, courage and self-
confidence must be thrown into the other to correct the balance. The greater
they are, the greater the margin that can be left for accidents. Thus courage
and self-confidence are essential in war, and theory should propose only
rules that give ample scope to these finest and least dispensable of military
virtues, in all their degrees and variations. Even in daring there can be
method and caution; but here they are measured by a different standard.

23. BUT WAR IS NONETHELESS A SERIOUS MEANS TO

A SERIOUS END: A MORE PRECISE DEFINITION OF

WAR

When whole communities go to war—whole peoples, and especially

civilized peoples—the reason always lies in some political situation, and the
occasion is always due to some political object. War, therefore, is an act of
policy. Were it a complete, untrammeled, absolute manifestation of violence
(as the pure concept would require), war would of its own independent will
usurp the place of policy the moment policy had brought it into being; it
would then drive policy out of office and rule by the laws of its own nature,
very much like a mine that can explode only in the manner or direction
predetermined by the setting. This, in fact, is the view that has been taken of
the matter whenever some discord between policy and the conduct of war
has stimulated theoretical distinctions of this kind. But in reality things are
different, and this view is thoroughly mistaken. In reality war, as has been
shown, is not like that. Its violence is not of the kind that explodes in a
single discharge, but is the effect of forces that do not always develop in
exactly the same manner or to the same degree. At times they will expand
sufficiently to overcome the resistance of inertia or friction; at others they
are too weak to have any effect. War is a pulsation of violence, variable in
strength and therefore variable in the speed with which it explodes and
discharges its energy. War moves on its goal with varying speeds; but it
always lasts long enough for influence to be exerted on the goal and for its
own course to be changed in one way or another—long enough, in other

words, to remain subject to the action of a superior intelligence. If we keep
in mind that war springs from some political purpose, it is natural that the
prime cause of its existence will remain the supreme consideration in
conducting it. That, however, does not imply that the political aim is a
tyrant. It must adapt itself to its chosen means, a process which can
radically change it; yet the political aim remains the first consideration.
Policy, then, will permeate all military operations, and, in so far as their
violent nature will admit, it will have a continuous influence on them.

24. WAR IS MERELY THE CONTINUATION OF POLICY

BY OTHER MEANS

25. THE DIVERSE NATURE OF WAR

At this point, to prevent the reader from going astray, it must be observed

that the phrase, the natural tendency of war, is used in its philosophical,
strictly logical sense alone and does not refer to the tendencies of the forces
that are actually engaged in fighting—including, for instance, the morale
and emotions of the combatants. At times, it is true, these might be so
aroused that the political factor would be hard put to control them. Yet such
a conflict will not occur very often, for if the motivations are so powerful
there must be a policy of proportionate magnitude. On the other hand, if
policy is directed only toward minor objectives, the emotions of the masses
will be little stirred and they will have to be stimulated rather than held
back.

27. THE EFFECTS OF THIS POINT OF VIEW ON THE
UNDERSTANDING OF MILITARY HISTORY AND THE

FOUNDATIONS OF THEORY

The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the

statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind
of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to
turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all
strategic questions and the most comprehensive. It will be given detailed
study later, in the chapter on war plans.

It is enough, for the moment, to have reached this stage and to have

established the cardinal point of view from which war and the theory- of
war have to be examined.

OceanofPDF.com

28. THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THEORY

The first of these three aspects mainly concerns the people; the second

the commander and his army; the third the government. The passions that
are to be kindled in war must already be inherent in the people; the scope
which the play of courage and talent will enjoy in the realm of probability
and chance depends on the particular character of the commander and the
army; but the political aims are the business of government alone.

These three tendencies are like three different codes of law, deep-rooted

in their subject and yet variable in their relationship to one another. A
theory that ignores any one of them or seeks to fix an arbitrary relationship
between them would conflict with reality to such an extent that for this
reason alone it would be totally useless.

Our task therefore is to develop a theory that maintains a balance

between these three tendencies, like an object suspended between three
magnets.

What lines might best be followed to achieve this difficult task will be

explored in the book on the theory of war [Book Two]. At any rate, the
preliminary concept of war which we have formulated casts a first ray of
light on the basic structure of theory, and enables us to make an initial
differentiation and identification of its major components.

OceanofPDF.com

If for a start we inquire into the objective of any particular war, which

must guide military action if the political purpose is to be properly served,
we find that the object of any war can vary just as much as its political
purpose and its actual circumstances.

If for the moment we consider the pure concept of war, we should have to

say that the political purpose of war had no connection with war itself; for if
war is an act of violence meant to force the enemy to do our will its aim
would have always and solely to be to overcome the enemy and disarm him.
That aim is derived from the theoretical concept of war; but since many
wars do actually come very close to fulfilling it, let us examine this kind of
war first of all.

Later, when we are dealing with the subject of war plans, we shall

investigate in greater detail what is meant by disarming a country. But we
should at once distinguish between three things, three broad objectives,
which between them cover everything: the armed forces, the country, and
the enemy’s will.

The fighting forces must be destroyed: that is, they must be put in such a

condition that they can no longer carry on the fight. Whenever we use the
phrase “destruction of the enemy’s forces” this alone is what we mean.

The country must be occupied; otherwise the enemy could raise fresh

military forces.

Yet both these things may be done and the war, that is the animosity and

the reciprocal effects of hostile elements, cannot be considered to have
ended so long as the enemy’s will has not been broken: in other words, so

long as the enemy government and its allies have not been driven to ask for
peace, or the population made to submit.

We may occupy a country completely, but hostilities can be renewed

again in the interior, or perhaps with allied help. This of course can also
happen after the peace treaty, but this only shows that not every war
necessarily leads to a final decision and settlement. But even if hostilities
should occur again, a peace treaty will always extinguish a mass of sparks
that might have gone on quietly smoldering. Further, tensions are
slackened, for lovers of peace (and they abound among every people under
all circumstances) will then abandon any thought of further action. Be that
as it may, we must always consider that with the conclusion of peace the
purpose of the war has been achieved and its business is at an end.

the safety of the country, the natural sequence would be to destroy them
first, and then subdue the country. Having achieved these two goals and
exploiting our own position of strength, we can bring the enemy to the
peace table. As a rule, destroying the enemy’s forces tends to be a gradual
process, as does the ensuing subjugation of the country. Normally the one
reacts on the other, in that loss of territory weakens the fighting forces; but
that particular sequence of events is not essential and therefore does not
always take place. Before they suffer seriously, the enemy’s forces may
retire to remote areas, or even withdraw to other countries. In that event, of
course, most or all of the country will be occupied.

ultimate means of accomplishing the war’s political purpose, which should
incorporate all the rest) is in fact not always encountered in reality, and need
not be fully achieved as a condition of peace. On no account should theory
raise it to the level of a law. Many treaties have been concluded before one
of the antagonists could be called powerless—even before the balance of
power had been seriously altered. What is more, a review of actual cases
shows a whole category of wars in which the very idea of defeating the
enemy is unreal: those in which the enemy is substantially the stronger
power.

inappropriate to actual conflict is that war can be of two very different
kinds, a point we discussed in the first chapter. If war were what pure

theory postulates, a war between states of markedly unequal strength would
be absurd, and so impossible. At most, material disparity could not go
beyond the amount that moral factors could replace; and social conditions
being what they are in Europe today, moral forces would not go far. But
wars have in fact been fought between states of very unequal strength, for
actual war is often far removed from the pure concept postulated by theory.
Inability to carry on the struggle can, in practice, be replaced by two other
grounds for making peace: the first is the improbability of victory; the
second is its unacceptable cost.

from the strict law of inherent necessity toward probabilities. The more the
circumstances that gave rise to the conflict cause it to do so, the slighter will
be its motives and the tensions which it occasions. And this makes it
understandable how an analysis of probabilities may lead to peace itself.
Not every war need be fought until one side collapses. When the motives
and tensions of war are slight we can imagine that the very faintest prospect
of defeat might be enough to cause one side to yield. If from the very start
the other side feels that this is probable, it will obviously concentrate on
bringing about this probability rather than take the long way round and
totally defeat the enemy.

Of even greater influence on the decision to make peace is the

consciousness of all the effort that has already been made and of the efforts
yet to come. Since war is not an act of senseless passion but is controlled by
its political object, the value of this object must determine the sacrifices to
be made for it in magnitude and also in duration. Once the expenditure of
effort exceeds the value of the political object, the object must be renounced
and peace must follow.

desire for peace on either side will rise and fall with the probability of
further successes and the amount of effort these would require. If such
incentives were of equal strength on both sides, the two would resolve their
political disputes by meeting half way. If the incentive grows on one side, it
should diminish on the other. Peace will result so long as their sum total is
sufficient—though the side that feels the lesser urge for peace will naturally
get the better bargain.

positive or negative character of the political ends is bound to produce in
practice. As we shall see, the difference is important, but at this stage we
must take a broader view because the original political objects can greatly
alter during the course of the war and may finally change entirely since they
are influenced by events and their probable consequences.

of course, is to choose objectives that will incidentally bring about the
enemy’s collapse—the destruction of his armed forces and the conquest of
his territory; but neither is quite what it would be if our real object were the
total defeat of the enemy. When we attack the enemy, it is one thing if we
mean our first operation to be followed by others until all resistance has
been broken; it is quite another if our aim is only to obtain a single victory,
in order to make the enemy insecure, to impress our greater strength upon
him, and to give him doubts about his future. If that is the extent of our aim,
we will employ no more strength than is absolutely necessary. In the same
way, conquest of territory is a different matter if the enemy’s collapse is not
the object. If we wish to gain total victory, then the destruction of his armed
forces is the most appropriate action and the occupation of his territory only
a consequence. To occupy land before his armies are defeated should be
considered at best a necessary evil. If on the other hand we do not aim at
destroying the opposing army, and if we are convinced that the enemy does
not seek a brutal decision, but rather fears it, then the seizure of a lightly
held or undefended province is an advantage in itself; and should this
advantage be enough to make the enemy fear for the final outcome, it can
be considered as a short cut on the road to peace.

But there is another way. It is possible to increase the likelihood of

success without defeating the enemy’s forces. I refer to operations that have
direct political repercussions, that are designed in the first place to disrupt
the opposing alliance, or to paralyze it, that gain us new allies, favorably
affect the political scene, etc. If such operations are possible it is obvious
that they can greatly improve our prospects and that they can form a much
shorter route to the goal than the destruction of the opposing armies.

The second question is how to influence the enemy’s expenditure of

effort; in other words, how to make the war more costly to him.

our destruction of them; and in his loss of territory—our conquest.

their significance with the variation in objectives. As a rule the differences
will be slight, but that should not mislead us, for in practice, when strong
motives are not present, the slightest nuances often decide between the
different uses of force. For the moment all that matters is to show that,
given certain conditions, different ways of reaching the objective are
possible and that they are neither inconsistent, absurd, nor even mistaken.

In addition, there are three other methods directly aimed at increasing the

enemy’s expenditure of effort. The first of these is invasion, that is the
seizure of enemy territory; not with the object of retaining it but in order to
exact financial contributions, or even to lay it waste. The immediate object
here is neither to conquer the enemy country nor to destroy its army, but
simply to cause general damage. The second method is to give priority to
operations that will increase the enemy’s suffering. It is easy to imagine two
alternatives: one operation is far more advantageous if the purpose is to
defeat the enemy; the other is more profitable if that cannot be done. The
first tends to be described as the more military, the second the more
political alternative. From the highest point of view, however, one is as
military as the other, and neither is appropriate unless it suits the particular
conditions. The third, and far the most important method, judging from the
frequency of its use, is to wear down the enemy. That expression is more
than a label; it describes the process precisely, and is not so metaphorical as
it may seem at first. Wearing down the enemy in a conflict means using the
duration of the war to bring about a gradual exhaustion of his physical and
moral resistance.

with the smallest possible objects, for obviously a major object requires
more effort than a minor one. The minimum object is pure self-defense; in
other words, fighting without a positive purpose. With such a policy our
relative strength will be at its height, and thus the prospects for a favorable
outcome will be greatest. But how far can this negativity be pushed?
Obviously not to the point of absolute passivity, for sheer endurance would
not be fighting at all. But resistance is a form of action, aimed at destroying
enough of the enemy’s power to force him to renounce his intentions. Every

single act of our resistance is directed to that act alone, and that is what
makes our policy negative.

negative aim than it would for a positive one. But that is just the difference:
the former is more likely to succeed and so to give you more security. What
it lacks in immediate effectiveness it must make up for in its use of time,
that is by prolonging the war. Thus the negative aim, which lies at the heart
of pure resistance, is also the natural formula for outlasting the enemy, for
wearing him down.

the difference between attack and defense. We shall not pursue the matter
now, but let us just say this: that from the negative purpose derive all the
advantages, all the more effective forms, of fighting, and that in it is
expressed the dynamic relationship between the magnitude and the
likelihood of success. All this will be gone into later.

If a negative aim—that is, the use of every means available for pure

resistance—gives an advantage in war, the advantage need only be enough
to balance any superiority the opponent may possess: in the end his political
object will not seem worth the effort it costs. He must then renounce his
policy. It is evident that this method, wearing down the enemy, applies to
the great number of cases where the weak endeavor to resist the strong.

Seven Years War: and had he tried to fight in the manner of Charles XII he
would unfailingly have been destroyed himself. But for seven years he
skillfully husbanded his strength and finally convinced the allies that far
greater efforts were needed than they had foreseen. Consequently they
made peace.

not all involve the opponent’s outright defeat. They range from the
destruction of the enemy’s forces, the conquest of his territory, to a
temporary occupation or invasion, to projects with an immediate political
purpose, and finally to passively awaiting the enemy’s attacks. Anyone of
these may be used to overcome the enemy’s will: the choice depends on
circumstances. One further kind of action, of shortcuts to the goal, needs
mention: one could call them arguments ad hominem. Is there a field of
human affairs where personal relations do not count, where the sparks they

strike do not leap across all practical considerations? The personalities of
statesmen and soldiers are such important factors that in war above all it is
vital not to underrate them. It is enough to mention this point: it would be
pedantic to attempt a systematic classification. It can be said, however, that
these questions of personality and personal relations raise the number of
possible ways of achieving the goal of policy to infinity.

To think of these shortcuts as rare exceptions, or to minimize the

difference they can make to the conduct of war, would be to underrate them.
To avoid that error we need only bear in mind how wide a range of political
interests can lead to war, or think for a moment of the gulf that separates a
war of annihilation, a struggle for political existence, from a war reluctantly
declared in consequence of political pressure or of an alliance that no longer
seems to reflect the state’s true interests. Between these two extremes lie
numerous gradations. If we reject a single one of them on theoretical
grounds, we may as well reject them all, and lose contact with the real
world.

So much then for the ends to be pursued in war; let us now turn to the

means.

There is only one: combat. However many forms combat takes, however

far it may be removed from the brute discharge of hatred and enmity of a
physical encounter, however many forces may intrude which themselves are
not part of fighting, it is inherent in the very concept of war that everything
that occurs must originally derive from combat.

takes. Everything that occurs in war results from the existence of armed
forces; but whenever armed forces, that is armed individuals, are used, the
idea of combat must be present.

to do with their creation, maintenance, and use.

the end.

Combat in war is not a contest between individuals. It is a whole made up

of many parts, and in that whole two elements may be distinguished, one
determined by the subject, the other by the objective. The mass of
combatants in an army endlessly forms fresh elements, which themselves
are parts of a greater structure. The fighting activity of each of these parts

constitutes a more or less clearly defined element. Moreover, combat itself
is made an element of war by its very purpose, by its objective.

named an engagement.

If the idea of fighting underlies every use of the fighting forces, then their

employment means simply the planning and organizing of a series of
engagements.

to the engagement. The end for which a soldier is recruited, clothed, armed,
and trained, the whole object of his sleeping, eating, drinking, and marching
is simply that he should fight at the right place and the right time.

If all threads of military activity lead to the engagement, then if we

control the engagement, we comprehend them all. Their results are
produced by our orders and by the execution of these orders, never directly
by other conditions. Since in the engagement everything is concentrated on
the destruction of the enemy, or rather of his armed forces, which is
inherent in its very concept, it follows that the destruction of the enemy’s
forces is always the means by which the purpose of the engagement is
achieved.

The purpose in question may be the destruction of the enemy’s forces,

but not necessarily so; it may be quite different. As we have shown, the
destruction of the enemy is not the only means of attaining the political
object, when there are other objectives for which the war is waged. It
follows that those other objectives can also become the purpose of
particular military operations, and thus also the purpose of engagements.

opposing forces, that destruction still need not be their first, immediate
concern.

factors that determine its employment, one can see that the fighting activity
of such a force is also subject to complex organization, division of
functions, and combinations. The separate units obviously must often be
assigned tasks that are not in themselves concerned with the destruction of
the enemy’s forces, which may indeed increase their losses but do so only
indirectly. If a battalion is ordered to drive the enemy from a hill, a bridge,
etc., the true purpose is normally to occupy that point. Destruction of the

enemy’s force is only a means to an end, a secondary matter. If a mere
demonstration is enough to cause the enemy to abandon his position, the
objective has been achieved; but as a rule the hill or bridge is captured only
so that even more damage can be inflicted on the enemy. If this is the case
on the battlefield, it will be even more so in the theater of operations, where
it is not merely two armies that are facing each other, but two states, two
peoples, two nations. The range of possible circumstances, and therefore of
options, is greatly increased, as is the variety of dispositions; and the
gradation of objects at various levels of command will further separate the
first means from the ultimate purpose.

Thus there are many reasons why the purpose of an engagement may not

be the destruction of the enemy’s forces, the forces immediately confronting
us. Destruction mav be merely a means to some other end. In such a case,
total destruction has ceased to be the point; the engagement is nothing but a
trial of strength. In itself it is of no value; its significance lies in the
outcome of the trial.

be enough. There will be no fighting: the weaker side will yield at once.

opposing forces, that their objectives can often be attained without any
fighting at all but merely by an evaluation of the situation, explains why
entire campaigns can be conducted with great energy even though actual
fighting plays an unimportant part in them.

we are only concerned to show that it is possible; we need not ask how
often it was appropriate, in other words consistent with the overall purpose,
to avoid the test of battle, or whether all the reputations made in such
campaigns would stand the test of critical examination.

There is only one means in war: combat. But the multiplicity of forms

that combat assumes leads us in as many different directions as are created
by the multiplicity of aims, so that our analysis does not seem to have made
any progress. But that is not so: the fact that only one means exists
constitutes a strand that runs through the entire web of military activity and
really holds it together.

many objects that can be pursued in war, and we have left aside the question

of its importance relative to other purposes. In any given case the answer
will depend on circumstances; its importance to war in general remains to
be clarified. We shall now go into this question, and we shall see what value
must necessarily be attributed to this object of destruction.

enemy’s forces as a means to a further end. That holds good even if no
actual fighting occurs, because the outcome rests on the assumption that if it
came to fighting, the enemy would be destroyed. It follows that the
destruction of the enemy’s force underlies all military actions; all plans are
ultimately based on it, resting on it like an arch on its abutment.
Consequently, all action is undertaken in the belief that if the ultimate test
of arms should actually occur, the outcome would be favorable. The
decision by arms is for all major and minor operations in war what cash
payment is in commerce. Regardless how complex the relationship between
the two parties, regardless how rarely settlements actually occur, they can
never be entirely absent.

If a decision by fighting is the basis of all plans and operations, it follows

that the enemy can frustrate everything through a successful battle. This
occurs not only when the encounter affects an essential factor in our plans,
but when any victory that is won is of sufficient scope. For every important
victory—that is, destruction of opposing forces—reacts on all other
possibilities. Like liquid, they will settle at a new level.

superior, more effective means, with which others cannot compete.

if we can assume that all other conditions are equal. It would be a great
mistake to deduce from this argument that a headlong rush must always
triumph over skillful caution. Blind aggressiveness would destroy the attack
itself, not the defense, and this is not what we are talking about. Greater
effectiveness relates not to the means but to the end; we are simply
comparing the effect of different outcomes.

nothing obliges us to limit this idea to physical forces: the moral element
must also be considered. The two interact throughout: they are inseparable.
We have just mentioned the effect that a great destructive act—a major
victory—inevitably exerts on all other actions, and it is exactly at such

times that the moral factor is, so to speak, the most fluid element of all, and
therefore spreads most easily to affect everything else. The advantage that
the destruction of the enemy possesses over all other means is balanced by
its cost and danger; and it is only in order to avoid these risks that other
policies are employed.

That the method of destruction cannot fail to be expensive is

understandable; other things being equal, the more intent we are on
destroying the enemy’s forces, the greater our own efforts must be.

greater will be the damage if we fail.

damaging if they fail, though this holds true only if both sides act
identically, if the enemy pursues the same course as we do. If he were to
seek the decision through a major battle, his choice would force us against
our will to do likewise. Then the outcome of the battle would be decisive;
but it is clear—other things again being equal—that we would be at an
overall disadvantage, since our plans and resources had been in part
intended to achieve other goals, whereas the enemy’s were not. Two
objectives, neither of which is part of the other, are mutually exclusive: one
force cannot simultaneously be used for both. If, therefore, one of the two
commanders is resolved to seek a decision through major battles, he will
have an excellent chance of success if he is certain that his opponent is
pursuing a different policy. Conversely, the commander who wishes to
adopt different means can reasonably do so only if he assumes his opponent
to be equally unwilling to resort to major battles.

refers only to the positive purposes, other than the destruction of enemy
forces, that can be pursued in war. It pertains in no way to pure resistance,
which seeks to wear down the opponent’s strength. Pure resistance has no
positive intention; we can use our forces only to frustrate the enemy’s
intentions, and not divert them to other objectives.

Here we must consider the negative side of destroying the enemy’s forces

—that is, the preservation of our own. These two efforts always go together;
they interact. They are integral parts of a single purpose, and we only need
to consider the result if one or the other dominates. The effort to destroy the
enemy’s forces has a positive purpose and leads to positive results, whose

final aim is the enemy’s collapse. Preserving our own forces has a negative
purpose; it frustrates the enemy’s intentions—that is, it amounts to pure
resistance, whose ultimate aim can only be to prolong the war until the
enemy is exhausted.

The policy with a positive purpose calls the act of destruction into being;

the policy with a negative purpose waits for it.

How far such a waiting attitude may or should be maintained is a

question we shall study in connection with the theory of attack and defense,
whose basic element is here involved. For the moment we need only say
that a policy of waiting must never become passive endurance, that any
action involved in it may just as well seek the destruction of the opposing
forces as any other objective. It would be a fundamental error to imagine
that a negative aim implies a preference for a bloodless decision over the
destruction of the enemy. A preponderantly negative effort may of course
lead to such a choice, but always at the risk that it is not the appropriate
course: that depends on factors that are determined not by us but by the
opponent. Avoidance of bloodshed, then, should not be taken as an act of
policy if our main concern is to preserve our forces. On the contrary, if such
a policy did not suit the particular situation it would lead our forces to
disaster. A great many generals have failed through this mistaken
assumption.

retard the decision: in other words, action is transposed into waiting for the
decisive moment. This usually means that action is postponed in time and
space to the extent that space is relevant and circumstances permit. If the
time arrives when further waiting would bring excessive disadvantages,
then the benefit of the negative policy has been exhausted. The destruction
of the enemy—an aim that has until then been postponed but not displaced
by another consideration—now reemerges.

to the goal, to the attainment of the political object, fighting is the only
possible means. Everything is governed by a supreme law, the decision by
force of arms. If the opponent does seek battle, this recourse can never be
denied him. A commander who prefers another strategy must first be sure
that his opponent either will not appeal to that supreme tribunal—force—or
that he will lose the verdict if he does. To sum up: of all the possible aims in

war, the destruction of the enemy’s armed forces always appears as the
highest.

can achieve in war. All we need to do for the moment is to admit the
general possibility of their existence, the possibility of deviating from the
basic concept of war under the pressure of special circumstances. But even
at this point we must not fail to emphasize that the violent resolution of the
crisis, the wish to annihilate the enemy’s forces, is the first-born son of war.
If the political aims are small, the motives slight and tensions low, a prudent
general may look for any way to avoid major crises and decisive actions,
exploit any weaknesses in the opponent’s military and political strategy, and
finally reach a peaceful settlement. If his assumptions are sound and
promise success we are not entitled to criticize him. But he must never
forget that he is moving on devious paths where the god of war may catch
him unawares. He must always keep an eye on his opponent so that he does
not, if the latter has taken up a sharp sword, approach him armed only with
an ornamental rapier.

purposes and means; the manner in which war in practice deviates in
varying degrees from its basic, rigorous concept, taking this form or that,
but always remaining subject to that basic concept, as to a supreme law; all
these points must be kept in mind in our subsequent analyses if we are to
perceive the real connections between all aspects of war, and the true
significance of each; and if we wish to avoid constantly falling into the
wildest inconsistencies with reality and even with our own arguments.

We are aware that this word is used in many senses, differing both in

degree and in kind. We also know that some of these meanings make it
difficult to establish the essence of genius. But since we claim no special
expertise in philosophy or grammar, we may be allowed to use the word in
its ordinary meaning, in which “genius” refers to a very highly developed
mental aptitude for a particular occupation.

Let us discuss this faculty, this distinction of mind for a moment, setting

out its claims in greater detail, so as to gain a better understanding of the
concept. But we cannot restrict our discussion to genius proper, as a
superlative degree of talent, for this concept lacks measurable limits. What
we must do is to survey all those gifts of mind and temperament that in
combination bear on military activity. These, taken together, constitute the
essence of military genius. We have said in combination, since it is
precisely the essence of military genius that it does not consist in a single
appropriate gift—courage, for example—while other qualities of mind or
temperament are wanting or are not suited to war. Genius consists in a
harmonious combination of elements, in which one or the other ability may
predominate, but none may be in conflict with the rest.

If every soldier needed some degree of military genius our armies would

be very weak, for the term refers to a special cast of mental or moral powers
which can rarely occur in an army when a society has to employ its abilities
in many different areas. The smaller the range of activities of a nation and
the more the military factor dominates, the greater will be the incidence of
military genius. This, however, is true only of its distribution, not of its

quality. The latter depends on the general intellectual development of a
given society. In any primitive, warlike race, the warrior spirit is far more
common than among civilized peoples. It is possessed by almost every
warrior: but in civilized societies only necessity will stimulate it in the
people as a whole, since they lack the natural disposition for it. On the other
hand, we will never find a savage who is a truly great commander, and very
rarely one who would be considered a military genius, since this requires a
degree of intellectual powers beyond anything that a primitive people can
develop. Civilized societies, too, can obviously possess a warlike character
to greater or lesser degree, and the more they develop it, the greater will be
the number of men with military spirit in their armies. Possession of
military genius coincides with the higher degrees of civilization: the most
highly developed societies produce the most brilliant soldiers, as the
Romans and the French have shown us. With them, as with everv people
renowned in war, the greatest names do not appear before a high level of
civilization has been reached.

We can already guess how great a role intellectual powers play in the

higher forms of military genius. Let us now examine the matter more
closely.

requirement.

courage to accept responsibility, either before the tribunal of some outside
power or before the court of one’s own conscience. Only the first kind will
be discussed here.

Courage in face of personal danger is also of two kinds. It may be

indifference to danger, which could be due to the individual’s constitution,
or to his holding life cheap, or to habit. In any case, it must be regarded as a
permanent condition. Alternatively, courage may result from such positive
motives as ambition, patriotism, or enthusiasm of any kind. In that case
courage is a feeling, an emotion, not a permanent state.

These two kinds of courage act in different ways. The first is the more

dependable; having become second nature, it will never fail. The other will
often achieve more. There is more reliability in the first kind, more
boldness in the second. The first leaves the mind calmer; the second tends

to stimulate, but it can also blind. The highest kind of courage is a
compound of both.

unless we can make ourselves indifferent to them, and for this birth or
training must provide us with a certain strength of body and soul. If we do
possess those qualities, then even if we have nothing but common sense to
guide them we shall be well equipped for war: it is exactly these qualities
that primitive and semicivilized peoples usually possess.

come to the region dominated by the powers of intellect. War is the realm of
uncertainty; three quarters of the factors on which action in war is based are
wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty. A sensitive and
discriminating judgment is called for; a skilled intelligence to scent out the
truth.

Average intelligence may recognize the truth occasionally, and

exceptional courage may now and then retrieve a blunder; but usually
intellectual inadequacy will be shown up by indifferent achievement.

scope: no other has such incessant and varied dealings with this intruder.
Chance makes everything more uncertain and interferes with the whole
course of events.

Since all information and assumptions are open to doubt, and with

chance at work everywhere, the commander continually finds that things
are not as he expected. This is bound to influence his plans, or at least the
assumptions underlying them. If this influence is sufficiently powerful to
cause a change in his plans, he must usually work out new ones; but for
these the necessary information may not be immediately available. During
an operation decisions have usually to be made at once: there may be no
time to review the situation or even to think it through. Usually, of course,
new information and reevaluation are not enough to make us give up our
intentions: they only call them in question. We now know more, but this
makes us more, not less uncertain. The latest reports do not arrive all at
once: they merely trickle in. They continually impinge on our decisions,
and our mind must be permanently armed, so to speak, to deal with them.

unforeseen, two qualities are indispensable: first, an intellect that, even in

the darkest hour, retains some glimmerings of the inner light which leads to
truth; and second, the courage to follow this faint light wherever it may
lead. The first of these qualities is described by the French term, coup
d’oeil; the second is determination.

engagement. Because time and space are important elements of the
engagement, and were particularly significant in the days when the cavalry
attack was the decisive factor, the idea of a rapid and accurate decision
was first based on an evaluation of time and space, and consequently
received a name which refers to visual estimates only. Many theorists of
war have employed the term in that limited sense. But soon it was also used
of any sound decision taken in the midst of action—such as recognizing the
right point to attack, etc. Coup d’oeil therefore refers not alone to the
physical but, more commonly, to the inward eye. The expression, like the
quality itself, has certainly always been more applicable to tactics, but it
must also have its place in strategy, since here as well quick decisions are
often needed. Stripped of metaphor and of the restrictions imposed on it by
the phrase, the concept merely refers to the quick recognition of a truth that
the mind would ordinarily miss or would perceive only after long study and
reflection.

becomes characteristic, a mental habit. But here we are referring not to
physical courage but to the courage to accept responsibility, courage in the
face of a moral danger. This has often been called courage d’esprit, because
it is created by the intellect. That, however, does not make it an act of the
intellect: it is an act of temperament. Intelligence alone is not courage; we
often see that the most intelligent people are irresolute. Since in the rush of
events a man is governed by feelings rather than by thought, the intellect
needs to arouse the quality of courage, which then supports and sustains it
in action.

Looked at in this way, the role of determination is to limit the agonies of

doubt and the perils of hesitation when the motives for action are
inadequate. Colloquially, to be sure, the term “determination” also applies
to a propensity for daring, pugnacity, boldness, or temerity. But when a man
has adequate grounds for action—whether subjective or objective, valid or
false—he cannot properly be called “determined.” This would amount to

putting oneself in his position and weighting the scale with a doubt that he
never felt. In such a case it is only a question of strength or weakness. I am
not such a pedant as to quarrel with common usage over a slight misuse of a
word; the only purpose of these remarks is to preclude misunderstandings.

by the intellect, and by a specific cast of mind at that. More is required to
create determination than a mere conjunction of superior insight with the
appropriate emotions. Some may bring the keenest brains to the most
formidable problems, and may possess the courage to accept serious
responsibilities; but when faced with a difficult situation they still find
themselves unable to reach a decision. Their courage and their intellect
work in separate compartments, not together; determination, therefore, does
not result. It is engendered only by a mental act; the mind tells man that
boldness is required, and thus gives direction to his will. This particular cast
of mind, which employs the fear of wavering and hesitating to suppress all
other fears, is the force that makes strong men determined. Men of low
intelligence, therefore, cannot possess determination in the sense in which
we use the word. They may act without hesitation in a crisis, but if they do,
they act without reflection; and a man who acts without reflection cannot,
of course, be torn by doubt. From time to time action of this type may even
be appropriate; but, as I have said before, it is the average result that
indicates the existence of military genius. The statement may surprise the
reader who knows some determined cavalry officers who are little given to
deep thought: but he must remember that we are talking about a special
kind of intelligence, not about great powers of meditation.

mind, from a strong rather than a brilliant one. We can give further proof of
this interpretation by pointing to the many examples of men who show
great determination as junior officers, but lose it as they rise in rank.
Conscious of the need to be decisive, they also recognize the risks entailed
by a wrong decision; since they are unfamiliar with the problems now
facing them, their mind loses its former incisiveness. The more used they
had been to instant action, the more their timidity increases as they realize
the dangers of the vacillation that ensnares them.

related subject: presence of mind. This must play a great role in war, the

domain of the unexpected, since it is nothing but an increased capacity of
dealing with the unexpected. We admire presence of mind in an apt
repartee, as we admire quick thinking in the face of danger. Neither needs to
be exceptional, so long as it meets the situation. A reaction following long
and deep reflection may seem quite commonplace; as an immediate
response, it may give keen pleasure. The expression “presence of mind”
precisely conveys the speed and immediacy of the help provided by the
intellect.

Whether this splendid quality is due to a special cast of mind or to steady

nerves depends on the nature of the incident, but neither can ever be
entirely lacking. A quick retort shows wit; resourcefulness in sudden danger
calls, above all, for steady nerve.

and chance. If we consider them together, it becomes evident how much
fortitude of mind and character are needed to make progress in these
impeding elements with safety and success. According to circumstance,
reporters and historians of war use such terms as energy, firmness,
staunchness, emotional balance, and strength of character. These products
of a heroic nature could almost be treated as one and the same force—
strength of will—which adjusts itself to circumstances: but though closely
linked, they are not identical. A closer study of the interplay of
psychological forces at work here may be worth while.

the weight, the burden, the resistance—call it what you like—that
challenges the psychological strength of the soldier, only a small part is the
direct result of the enemy’s activity, his resistance, or his operations. The
direct and primary impact of enemy activity falls, initially, on the soldier’s
person without affecting him in his capacity as commander. If, for example,
the enemy resists four hours instead of two, the commander is in danger
twice as long; but the higher an officer’s rank, the less significant this factor
becomes, and to the commander-in-chief it means nothing at all.

A second way in which the enemy’s resistance directly affects the

commander is the loss that is caused by prolonged resistance and the
influence this exerts on his sense of responsibility. The deep anxiety which
he must experience works on his strength of will and puts it to the test. Yet
we believe that this is not by any means the heaviest burden he must bear,

for he is answerable to himself alone. All other effects of enemy action,
however, are felt by the men under his command, and through them react
on him.

So long as a unit fights cheerfully, with spirit and elan, great strength of

will is rarely needed; but once conditions become difficult, as they must
when much is at stake, things no longer run like a well-oiled machine. The
machine itself begins to resist, and the commander needs tremendous
willpower to overcome this resistance. The machine’s resistance need not
consist of disobedience and argument, though this occurs often enough in
individual soldiers. It is the impact of the ebbing of moral and physical
strength, of the heart-rending spectacle of the dead and wounded, that the
commander has to withstand—first in himself, and then in all those who,
directly or indirectly, have entrusted him with their thoughts and feelings,
hopes and fears. As each man’s strength gives out, as it no longer responds
to his will, the inertia of the whole gradually comes to rest on the
commander’s will alone. The ardor of his spirit must rekindle the flame of
purpose in all others; his inward fire must revive their hope. Only to the
extent that he can do this will he retain his hold on his men and keep
control. Once that hold is lost, once his own courage can no longer revive
the courage of his men, the mass will drag him down to the brutish world
where danger is shirked and shame is unknown. Such are the burdens in
battle that the commander’s courage and strength of will must overcome if
he hopes to achieve outstanding success. The burdens increase with the
number of men in his command, and therefore the higher his position, the
greater the strength of character he needs to bear the mounting load.

whether the motive be the result of intellectual conviction or of emotion.
Great strength, however, is not easily produced where there is no emotion.

so powerful and so constant as the longing for honor and renown. The
German language unjustly tarnishes this by associating it with two ignoble
meanings in the terms “greed for honor” (Ehrgeiz) and “hankering after
glory” (Ruhmsucht). The abuse of these noble ambitions has certainly
inflicted the most disgusting outrages on the human race; nevertheless their
origins entitle them to be ranked among the most elevated in human nature.
In war they act as the essential breath of life that animates the inert mass.

Other emotions may be more common and more venerated—patriotism,
idealism, vengeance, enthusiasm of every kind—but they are no substitute
for a thirst for fame and honor. They may, indeed, rouse the mass to action
and inspire it, but they cannot give the commander the ambition to strive
higher than the rest, as he must if he is to distinguish himself. They cannot
give him, as can ambition, a personal, almost proprietary interest in every
aspect of fighting, so that he turns each opportunity to best advantage-
plowing with vigor, sowing with care, in the hope of reaping with
abundance. It is primarily this spirit of endeavor on the part of commanders
at all levels, this inventiveness, energy, and competitive enthusiasm, which
vitalizes an army and makes it victorious. And so far as the commander-in-
chief is concerned, we may well ask whether history has ever known a great
general who was not ambitious; whether, indeed, such a figure is
conceivable.

refers to prolonged resistance.

difference between them is significant and unmistakable. Staunchness in
face of a single blow may result from strong emotion, whereas intelligence
helps sustain endurance. The longer an action lasts, the more deliberate
endurance becomes, and this is one of its sources of strength.

we mean by these terms.

that would strain the meaning of the phrase. We mean the ability to keep
one’s head at times of exceptional stress and violent emotion. Could
strength of intellect alone account for such a faculty? We doubt it. Of course
the opposite does not flow from the fact that some men of outstanding
intellect do lose their self-control; it could be argued that a powerful rather
than a capacious mind is what is needed. But it might be closer to the truth
to assume that the faculty known as self-control—the gift of keeping calm
even under the greatest stress—is rooted in temperament. It is itself an
emotion which serves to balance the passionate feelings in strong characters
without destroying them, and it is this balance alone that assures the
dominance of the intellect. The counterweight we mean is simply the sense
of human dignity, the noblest pride and deepest need of all: the urge to act

rationally at all times. Therefore we would argue that a strong character is
one that will not be unbalanced by the most powerful emotions.

group with small capacity for being roused, usually known as “stolid” or
“phlegmatic.”

Second, there are men who are extremely active, but whose feelings

never rise above a certain level, men whom we know to be sensitive but
calm.

Third, there are men whose passions are easily inflamed, in whom

excitement flares up suddenly but soon burns out, like gunpowder. And
finally we come to those who do not react to minor matters, who will be
moved only very gradually, not suddenly, but whose emotions attain great
strength and durability. These are the men whose passions are strong, deep,
and concealed.

human being—they are part of that dual organism we call the nervous
system, one side of which is physical, the other psychological. With our
slight scientific knowledge we have no business to go farther into that
obscure field; it is important nonetheless to note the ways in which these
various psychological combinations can affect military activity, and to find
out how far one can look for great strength of character among them.

really be interpreted as strength of character. It cannot be denied, however,
that the imperturbability of such men gives them a certain narrow
usefulness in war. They are seldom strongly motivated, lack initiative and
consequently are not particularly active; on the other hand they seldom
make a serious mistake.

The salient point about the second group is that trifles can suddenly stir

them to act, whereas great issues are likely to overwhelm them. This kind of
man will gladly help an individual in need, but the misfortune of an entire
people will only sadden him; they will not stimulate him to action.

In war such men show no lack of energy or balance, but they are unlikely

to achieve anything significant unless they possess a very powerful intellect
to provide the needed stimulus. But it is rare to find this type of
temperament combined with a strong and independent mind.

little value in practical life, and therefore of little value in war. Their
impulses are strong but brief. If the energy of such men is joined to courage
and ambition they will often prove most useful at a modest level of
command, simply because the action controlled by junior officers is of short
duration. Often a single brave decision, a burst of emotional force, will be
enough. A daring assault is the work of a few minutes, while a hard-fought
battle may last a day, and a campaign an entire year.

their balance; they often lose their heads, and nothing is worse on active
service. All the same, it would be untrue to say that highly excitable minds
could never be strong—that is, could never keep their balance even under
the greatest strain. Why should they not have a sense of their own dignity,
since as a rule they are among the finer natures? In fact, they usually have
such a sense, but there is not time for it to take effect. Once the crisis is
past, they tend to be ashamed of their behavior. If training, self-awareness,
and experience sooner or later teaches them how to be on guard against
themselves, then in times of great excitement an internal counterweight will
assert itself so that they too can draw on great strength of character.

Lastly, we come to men who are difficult to move but have strong

feelings—men who are to the previous type like heat to a shower of sparks.
These are the men who are best able to summon the titanic strength it takes
to clear away the enormous burdens that obstruct activity in war. Their
emotions move as great masses do—slowty but irresistibly.

group, but experience shows that they too can lose their balance and be
overcome by blind passion. This can happen whenever they lack the noble
pride of self-control, or whenever it is inadequate. We find this condition
mostly among great men in primitive societies, where passion tends to rule
for lack of intellectual discipline. Yet even among educated peoples and
civilized societies men are often swept away by passion, just as in the
Middle Ages poachers chained to stags were carried off into the forest.

powerful feelings, but in maintaining one’s balance in spite of them. Even
with the violence of emotion, judgment and principle must still function

like a ship’s compass, which records the slightest variations however rough
the sea.

sticks to his convictions, whether these derive from his own opinions or
someone else’s, whether they represent principles, attitudes, sudden
insights, or any other mental force. Such firmness cannot show itself, of
course, if a man keeps changing his mind. This need not be the consequence
of external influence; the cause may be the workings of his own
intelligence, but this would suggest a peculiarly insecure mind. Obviously a
man whose opinions are constantly changing, even though this is in
response to his own reflections, would not be called a man of character. The
term is applied only to men whose views are stable and constant. This may
be because they are well thought-out, clear, and scarcely open to revision;
or, in the case of indolent men, because such people are not in the habit of
mental effort and therefore have no reason for altering their views; and
finally, because a firm decision, based on fundamental principle derived
from reflection, is relatively immune to changes of opinion.

information and opinion, there is no activity like war to rob men of
confidence in themselves and in others, and to divert them from their
original course of action.

overwhelm intellectual conviction, and in this psychological fog it is so
hard to form clear and complete insights that changes of view become more
understandable and excusable. Action can never be based on anything
firmer than instinct, a sensing of the truth. Nowhere, in consequence, are
differences of opinion so acute as in war, and fresh opinions never cease to
batter at one’s convictions. No degree of calm can provide enough
protection: new impressions are too powerful, too vivid, and always assault
the emotions as well as the intellect.

Only those general principles and attitudes that result from clear and deep

understanding can provide a comprehensive guide to action. It is to these
that opinions on specific problems should be anchored. The difficulty is to
hold fast to these results of contemplation in the torrent of events and new
opinions. Often there is a gap between principles and actual events that
cannot always be bridged by a succession of logical deductions. Then a

measure of self-confidence is needed, and a degree of skepticism is also
salutary. Frequently nothing short of an imperative principle will suffice,
which is not part of the immediate thought-process, but dominates it: that
principle is in all doubtful cases to stick to one’s first opinion and to refuse
to change unless forced to do so by a clear conviction. A strong faith in the
overriding truth of tested principles is needed; the vividness of transient
impressions must not make us forget that such truth as they contain is of a
lesser stamp. By giving precedence, in case of doubt, to our earlier
convictions, by holding to them stubbornly, our actions acquire that quality
of steadiness and consistency which is termed strength of character.

temperament; most men of emotional strength and stability are therefore
men of powerful character as well.

them is often hard to draw in a specific case; but surely it is easy to
distinguish them in theory.

that one is wrong. To impute this to the mind would be illogical, for the
mind is the seat of judgment. Obstinacy is a fault of temperament.
Stubbornness and intolerance of contradiction result from a special kind of
egotism, which elevates above everything else the pleasure of its
autonomous intellect, to which others must bow. It might also be called
vanity, if it were not something superior: vanity is content with the
appearance alone; obstinacy demands the material reality.

soon as a man resists another point of view not from superior insight or
attachment to some higher principle, but because he objects instinctively.
Admittedly, this definition may not be of much practical use; but it will
nevertheless help us avoid the interpretation that obstinacy is simply a more
intense form of strong character. There is a basic difference between the
two. They are closely related, but one is so far from being a higher degree
of the other that we can even find extremely obstinate men who are too
dense to have much strength of character.

has been concerned with qualities in which mind and temperament work
together. Now we must address ourselves to a special feature of military

activity—possibly the most striking even though it is not the most important
—which is not related to temperament, and involves merely the intellect. I
mean the relationship between warfare and terrain.

one cannot conceive of a regular army operating except in a definite space.
Second, its importance is decisive in the highest degree, for it affects the
operations of all forces, and at times entirely alters them. Third, its
influence may be felt in the very smallest feature of the ground, but it can
also dominate enormous areas.

peculiar character of military action. If we consider other activities
connected with the soil—gardening, for example, farming, building,
hydraulic engineering, mining, game-keeping, or forestry—none extends to
more than a very limited area, and a working knowledge of that area is soon
acquired. But a commander must submit his work to a partner, space, which
he can never completely reconnoiter, and which because of the constant
movement and change to which he is subject he can never really come to
know. To be sure, the enemy is generally no better off; but the handicap,
though shared, is still a handicap, and the man with enough talent and
experience to overcome it will have a real advantage. Moreover it is only in
a general sense that the difficulty is the same for both sides; in any
particular case the defender usually knows the area far better than his
opponent.

given the too restricted name of a sense of locality. It is the faculty of
quickly and accurately grasping the topograPhy of any area which enables
a man to find his way about at any time. Obviously this is an act of the
imagination. Things are perceived, of course, partly by the naked eye and
partly by the mind, which fills the gaps with guesswork based on learning
and experience, and thus constructs a whole out of the fragments that the
eye can see; but if the whole is to be vividly present to the mind, imprinted
like a picture, like a map, upon the brain, without fading or blurring in
detail, it can only be achieved by the mental gift that we call imagination. A
poet or painter may be shocked to find that his Muse dominates these
activities as well: to him it might seem odd to say that a young gamekeeper
needs an unusually powerful imagination in order to be competent. If so, we

gladly admit that this is to apply the concept narrowly and to a modest task.
But however remote the connection, his skill must still derive from this
natural gift, for if imagination is entirely lacking it would be difficult to
combine details into a clear, coherent image. We also admit that a good
memory can be a great help; but are we then to think of memory as a
separate gift of the mind, or does imagination, after all, imprint those
pictures in the memory more clearly? The question must be left
unanswered, especially since it seems difficult even to conceive of these
two forces as operating separately.

Puységur, the celebrated quarter-master-general of Marshal Luxembourg,
writes that at the beginning of his career he had little faith in his sense of
locality; when he had to ride any distance at all to get the password, he
invariably lost his way.

scout leading a patrol must find his way easily among the roads and tracks.
All he needs are a few landmarks and some modest powers of observation
and imagination. A commander-in-chief, on the other hand, must aim at
acquiring an overall knowledge of the configuration of a province, of an
entire country. His mind must hold a vivid picture of the road-network, the
river-lines and the mountain ranges, without ever losing a sense of his
immediate surroundings. Of course he can draw general information from
reports of all kinds, from maps, books, and memoirs. Details will be
furnished by his staff. Nevertheless it is true that with a quick, unerring
sense of locality his dispositions will be more rapid and assured; he will run
less risk of a certain awkwardness in his concepts, and be less dependent on
others.

service that war can demand from this frivolous goddess, who in most
military affairs is liable to do more harm than good.

With this, we believe, we have reached the end of our review of the

intellectual and moral powers that human nature needs to draw upon in war.
The vital contribution of intelligence is clear throughout. No wonder then,
that war, though it may appear to be uncomplicated, cannot be waged with
distinction except by men of outstanding intellect.

takes a great intellectual effort to outflank an enemy position (an obvious
move, performed innumerable times) or to carry out a multitude of similar
operations.

It is true that we normally regard the plain, efficient soldier as the very

opposite of the contemplative scholar, or of the inventive intellectual with
his dazzling range of knowledge. This antithesis is not entirely unrealistic;
but it does not prove that courage alone will make an efficient soldier, or
that having brains and using them is not a necessary part of being a good
fighting man. Once again we must insist: no case is more common than that
of the officer whose energy declines as he rises in rank and fills positions
that are beyond his abilities. But we must also remind the reader that
outstanding effort, the kind that gives men a distinguished name, is what we
have in mind. Every level of command has its own intellectual standards, its
own prerequisites for fame and honor.

A major gulf exists between a commander-in-chief—a general who leads

the army as a whole or commands in a theater of operations—and the senior
generals immediately subordinate to him. The reason is simple: the second
level is subjected to much closer control and supervision, and thus gives far
less scope for independent thought. People therefore often think outstanding
intellectual ability is called for only at the top, and that for all other duties
common intelligence will’ suffice. A general of lesser responsibility, an
officer grown gray in the service, his mind well-blinkered by long years of
routine, may often be considered to have developed a certain stodginess; his
gallantry is respected, but his simplemindedness makes us smile. We do not
intend to champion and promote these good men; it would contribute
nothing to their efficiency, and little to their happiness. We only wish to
show things as they are, so that the reader should not think that a brave but
brainless fighter can do anything of outstanding significance in war.

intellectual qualities for outstanding achievement, and since the standard
rises with every step, it follows that we recognize the abilities that are
needed if the second positions in an army are to be filled with distinction.
Such officers may appear to be rather simple compared to the polymath
scholar, the far-ranging business executive, the statesman; but we should
not dismiss the value of their practical intelligence. It sometimes happens of

course that someone who made his reputation in one rank carries it with
him when he is promoted, without really deserving to. If not much is
demanded of him, and he can avoid exposing his incompetence, it is
difficult to decide what reputation he really deserves. Such cases often
cause one to hold in low estimate soldiers who in less responsible positions
might do excellent work.

Appropriate talent is needed at all levels if distinguished service is to be

performed. But history and posterity reserve the name of “genius” for those
who have excelled in the highest positions—as commanders-in-chief—
since here the demands for intellectual and moral powers are vastly greater.

thorough grasp of national policy. On that level strategy and policy
coalesce: the commander-in-chief is simultaneously a statesman.

never subordinate his military gifts to superior insights and wisdom, and
could never achieve a great goal with them. Nor do we think of Henry IV of
France in this manner: he was killed before his skill in war could affect the
relations between states. Death denied him the chance to prove his talents in
this higher sphere, where noble feelings and a generous disposition, which
effectively appeased internal dissension, would have had to face a more
intractable opponent.

The great range of business that a supreme commander must swiftly

absorb and accurately evaluate has been indicated in the first chapter. We
argue that a commander-in-chief must also be a statesman, but he must not
cease to be a general. On the one hand, he is aware of the entire political
situation; on the other, he knows exactly how much he can achieve with the
means at his disposal.

vast array of factors has to be appreciated—mostly in the light of
probabilities alone. The man responsible for evaluating the whole must
bring to his task the quality of intuition that perceives the truth at every
point. Otherwise a chaos of opinions and considerations would arise, and
fatally entangle judgment. Bonaparte rightly said in this connection that
many of the decisions faced by the commander-in-chief resemble
mathematical problems worthy of the gifts of a Newton or an Euler.

unity and a power of judgment raised to a marvelous pitch of vision, which
easily grasps and dismisses a thousand remote possibilities which an
ordinary mind would labor to identify and wear itself out in so doing. Yet
even that superb display of divination, the sovereign eye of genius itself,
would still fall short of historical significance without the qualities of
character and temperament we have described.

always long from cognition to volition, from knowledge to ability. The most
powerful springs of action in men lie in his emotions. He derives his most
vigorous support, if we may use the term, from that blend of brains and
temperament which we have learned to recognize in the qualities of
determination, firmness, staunchness, and strength of character.

were only taken on trust, they would rarely achieve historical importance.

nondescript. One action resembles another, and from a mere recital of
events it would be impossible to guess what obstacles were faced and
overcome. Only now and then, in the memoirs of generals or of their
confidants, or as the result of close historical study, are some of the
countless threads of the tapestry revealed. Most of the arguments and
clashes of opinion that precede a major operation are deliberately concealed
because they touch political interests, or they are simply forgotten, being
considered as scaffolding to be demolished when the building is complete.

reaches of the spirit, let us assert that the human mind (in the normal
meaning of the term) is far from uniform. If we then ask what sort of mind
is likeliest to display the qualities of military genius, experience and
observation will both tell us that it is the inquiring rather than the creative
mind, the comprehensive rather than the specialized approach, the calm
rather than the excitable head to which in war we would choose to entrust
the fate of our brothers and children, and the safety and honor of our
country.

Let us accompany a novice to the battlefield. As we approach the rumble

of guns grows louder and alternates with the whir of cannonballs, which
begin to attract his attention. Shots begin to strike close around us. We
hurry up the slope where the commanding general is stationed with his large
staff. Here cannonballs and bursting shells are frequent, and life begins to
seem more serious than the young man had imagined. Suddenly someone
you know is wounded; then a shell falls among the staff. You notice that
some of the officers act a little oddly; you yourself are not as steady and
collected as you were: even the bravest can become slightly distracted. Now
we enter the battle raging before us, still almost like a spectacle, and join
the nearest divisional commander. Shot is falling like hail, and the thunder
of our own guns adds to the din. Forward to the brigadier, a soldier of
acknowledged bravery, but he is careful to take cover behind a rise, a house
or a clump of trees. A noise is heard that is a certain indication of increasing
danger—the rattling of grapeshot on roofs and on the ground. Cannonballs
tear past, whizzing in all directions, and musketballs begin to whistle
around us. A little further we reach the firing line, where the infantry
endures the hammering for hours with incredible steadfastness. The air is
filled with hissing bullets that sound like a sharp crack if they pass close to

one’s head. For a final shock, the sight of men being killed and mutilated
moves our pounding hearts to awe and pity.

danger without sensing that here ideas are governed by other factors, that
the light of reason is refracted in a manner quite different from that which is
normal in academic speculation. It is an exceptional man who keeps his
powers of quick decision intact if he has never been through this experience
before. It is true that (with habit) as we become accustomed to it the
impression soon wears off, and in half-an-hour we hardly notice our
surroundings any more; yet the ordinary man can never achieve a state of
perfect unconcern in which his mind can work with normal flexibility. Here
again we recognize that ordinary qualities are not enough; and the greater
the area of responsibility, the truer this assertion becomes. Headlong,
dogged, or innate courage, overmastering ambition, or long familiarity with
danger—all must be present to a considerable degree if action in this
debilitating element is not to fall short of achievements that in the study
would appear as nothing out of the ordinary.

danger we cannot understand war. That is why I have dealt with it here.

Among the many factors in war that cannot be measured, physical effort

is the most important. Unless it is wasted, physical effort is a coefficient of
all forces, and its exact limit cannot be determined. But it is significant that,
just as it takes a powerful archer to bend the bow beyond the average, so it
takes a powerful mind to drive his army to the limit. It is one thing for an
army that has been badly defeated, is beset by danger on all sides, and is
disintegrating like crumbling masonry, to seek its safety in utmost physical
effort. It is altogether different when a victorious army, buoyed up by its
own exhilaration, remains a willing instrument in the hands of its
commander. The same effort, which in the former case can at most arouse
sympathy, must be admired in the other, where it is much harder to
maintain.

The inexperienced observer now comes to recognize one of the elements

that seem to chain the spirit and secretly wear away men’s energies.

Although we are dealing only with the efforts that a general can demand

of his troops, a commander of his subordinates, in other words although we
are concerned with the courage it takes to make the demand and the skill to
keep up the response, we must not forget the physical exertion required of

the commander himself. Since we have pursued our analysis of war
conscientiously to this point, we must deal with this residue as well.

one of the great sources of friction in war. Because its limits are uncertain,
it resembles one of those substances whose elasticity makes the degree of
its friction exceedingly hard to gauge.

of war, from being misused, we have a natural guide in our sensibilities. No
one can count on sympathy if he accepts an insult or mistreatment because
he claims to be physically handicapped. But if he manages to defend or
revenge himself, a reference to his handicap will be to his advantage. In the
same way, a general and an army cannot remove the stain of defeat by
explaining the dangers, hardships, and exertions that were endured; but to
depict them adds immensely to the credit of a victory. We are prevented
from making an apparently justified statement by our feelings, which
themselves act as a higher judgment.

and most are uncertain. What one can reasonably ask of an officer is that he
should possess a standard of judgment, which he can gain only from
knowledge of men and affairs and from common sense. He should be
guided by the laws of probability. These are difficult enough to apply when
plans are drafted in an office, far from the sphere of action; the task
becomes infinitely harder in the thick of fighting itself, with reports
streaming in. At such times one is lucky if their contradictions cancel each
other out, and leave a kind of balance to be critically assessed. It is much
worse for the novice if chance does not help him in that way, and on the
contrary one report tallies with another, confirms it, magnifies it, lends it
color, till he has to make a quick decision—which is soon recognized to be
mistaken, just as the reports turn out to be lies, exaggerations, errors, and so
on. In short, most intelligence is false, and the effect of fear is to multiply
lies and inaccuracies. As a rule most men would rather believe bad news
than good, and rather tend to exaggerate the bad news. The dangers that are
reported may soon, like waves, subside; but like waves they keep recurring,
without apparent reason. The commander must trust his judgment and stand
like a rock on which the waves break in vain. It is not an easy thing to do. If

he does not have a buoyant disposition, if experience of war has not trained
him and matured his judgment, he had better make it a rule to suppress his
personal convictions, and give his hopes and not his fears the benefit of the
doubt. Only thus can he preserve a proper balance.

This difficulty of accurate recognition constitutes one of the most serious

sources of friction in war, by making things appear entirely different from
what one had expected. The senses make a more vivid impression on the
mind than systematic thought—so much so that I doubt if a commander
ever launched an operation of any magnitude without being forced to
repress new misgivings from the start. Ordinary men, who normally follow
the initiative of others, tend to lose self-confidence when they reach the
scene of action: things are not what they expected, the more so as they still
let others influence them. But even the man who planned the operation and
now sees it being carried out may well lose confidence in his earlier
judgment; whereas self-reliance is his best defense against the pressures of
the moment. War has a way of masking the stage with scenery crudely
daubed with fearsome apparitions. Once this is cleared away, and the
horizon becomes unobstructed, developments will confirm his earlier
convictions—this is one of the great chasms between planning and
execution.

Everything in war is very simple, but the simplest thing is difficult. The

difficulties accumulate and end by producing a kind of friction that is
inconceivable unless one has experienced war. Imagine a traveler who late
in the day decides to cover two more stages before nightfall. Only four or
five hours more, on a paved highway with relays of horses: it should be an
easy trip. But at the next station he finds no fresh horses, or only poor ones;
the country grows hilly, the road bad, night falls, and finally after many
difficulties he is only too glad to reach a resting place with any kind of
primitive accommodation. It is much the same in war. Countless minor
incidents—the kind you can never really foresee—combine to lower the
general level of performance, so that one always falls far short of the
intended goal. Iron will-power can overcome this friction; it pulverizes
every obstacle, but of course it wears down the machine as well. We shall
often return to this point. The proud spirit’s firm will dominates the art of
war as an obelisk dominates the town square on which all roads converge.

Friction is the only concept that more or less corresponds to the factors

that distinguish real war from war on paper. The military machine—the
army and everything related to it—is basically very simple and therefore
seems easy to manage. But we should bear in mind that none of its
components is of one piece: each part is composed of individuals, every one

of whom retains his potential of friction. In theory it sounds reasonable
enough: a battalion commander’s duty is to carry out his orders; discipline
welds the battalion together, its commander must be a man of tested
capacity, and so the great beam turns on its iron pivot with a minimum of
friction. In fact, it is different, and every fault and exaggeration of the
theory is instantly exposed in war. A battalion is made up of individuals, the
least important of whom may chance to delay things or somehow make
them go wrong. The dangers inseparable from war and the physical
exertions war demands can aggravate the problem to such an extent that
they must be ranked among its principal causes.

few points, is everywhere in contact with chance, and brings about effects
that cannot be measured, just because they are largely due to chance. One,
for example, is the weather. Fog can prevent the enemy from being seen in
time, a gun from firing when it should, a report from reaching the
commanding officer. Rain can prevent a battalion from arriving, make
another late by keeping it not three but eight hours on the march, ruin a
cavalry charge by bogging the horses down in mud, etc.

We give these examples simply for illustration, to help the reader follow

the argument. It would take volumes to cover all difficulties. We could
exhaust the reader with illustrations alone if we really tried to deal with the
whole range of minor troubles that must be faced in war. The few we have
given will be excused by those readers who have long since understood
what we are after.

Action in war is like movement in a resistant element. Just as the

simplest and most natural of movements, walking, cannot easily be
performed in water, so in war it is difficult for normal efforts to achieve
even moderate results. A genuine theorist is like a swimming teacher, who
makes his pupils practice motions on land that are meant to be performed in
water. To those who are not thinking of swimming the motions will appear
grotesque and exaggerated. By the same token, theorists who have never
swum, or who have not learned to generalize from experience, are
impractical and even ridiculous: they teach only what is already common
knowledge: how to walk.

full of reefs. The commander may suspect the reefs’ existence without ever

having seen them; now he has to steer past them in the dark. If a contrary
wind springs up, if some major mischance appears, he will need the greatest
skill and personal exertion, and the utmost presence of mind, though from a
distance everything may seem to be proceeding automatically. An
understanding of friction is a large part of that much-admired sense of
warfare which a good general is supposed to possess. To be sure, the best
general is not the one who is most familiar with the idea of friction, and
who takes it most to heart (he belongs to the anxious type so common
among experienced commanders). The good general must know friction in
order to overcome it whenever possible, and in order not to expect a
standard of achievement in his operations which this very friction makes
impossible. Incidentally, it is a force that theory can never quite define.
Even if it could, the development of instinct and tact would still be needed,
a form of judgment much more necessary in an area littered by endless
minor obstacles than in great, momentous questions, which are settled in
solitary deliberation or in discussion with others. As with a man of the
world instinct becomes almost habit so that he always acts, speaks, and
moves appropriately, so only the experienced officer will make the right
decision in major and minor matters—at every pulsebeat of war. Practice
and experience dictate the answer: “this is possible, that is not.” So he
rarely makes a serious mistake, such as can, in war, shatter confidence and
become extremely dangerous if it occurs often.

Friction, as we choose to call it, is the force that makes the apparently

easy so difficult. We shall frequently revert to this subject, and it will
become evident that an eminent commander needs more than experience
and a strong will. He must have other exceptional abilities as well.

Habit hardens the body for great exertions, strengthens the heart in great

peril, and fortifies judgment against first impressions. Habit breeds that
priceless quality, calm, which, passing from hussar and rifleman up to the
general himself, will lighten the commander’s task.

In war the experienced soldier reacts rather in the same way as the human

eye does in the dark: the pupil expands to admit what little light there is,
discerning objects bv degrees, and finally seeing them distinctly. By
contrast, the novice is plunged into the deepest night.

No general can accustom an army to war. Peacetime maneuvers are a

feeble substitute for the real thing; but even they can give an army an
advantage over others whose training is confined to routine, mechanical
drill. To plan maneuvers so that some of the elements of friction are
involved, which will train officers’ judgment, common sense, and
resolution is far more worthwhile than inexperienced people might think. It
is immensely important that no soldier, whatever his rank, should wait for
war to expose him to those aspects of active service that amaze and confuse
him when he first comes across them. If he has met them even once before,
they will begin to be familiar to him. This is true even of physical effort.
Exertions must be practiced, and the mind must be made even more familiar
with them than the body. When exceptional efforts are required of him in
war, the recruit is apt to think that they result from mistakes,
miscalculations, and confusion at the top. In consequence, his morale is

doubly depressed. If maneuvers prepare him for exertions, this will not
occur.

Another very useful, though more limited, way of gaining familiarity

with war in peacetime is to attract foreign officers who have seen active
service. Peace does not often reign everywhere in Europe, and never
throughout the whole world. A state that has been at peace for many years
should try to attract some experienced officers—only those, of course, who
have distinguished themselves. Alternatively, some of its own officers
should be sent to observe operations, and learn what war is like.

However few such officers may be in proportion to an army, their

influence can be very real. Their experience, their insights, and the maturity
of their character will affect their subordinates and brother officers. Even
when they cannot be given high command they should be considered as
guides who know the country and can be consulted in specific eventualities.

advantages in combat, and these brought about great changes in the forms
of fighting. Still, no matter how it is constituted, the concept of fighting
remains unchanged. That is what we mean by war.

The first inventions consisted of weapons and equipment for the

individual warrior. They have to be produced and tested before war begins;
they suit the nature of the fighting, which in turn determines their design.
Obviously, however, this activity must be distinguished from fighting
proper; it is only the preparation for it, not its conduct. It is clear that
weapons and equipment are not essential to the concept of fighting, since
even wrestling is fighting of a kind.

Fighting has determined the nature of the weapons employed. These in

turn influence the combat; thus an interaction exists between the two.

But fighting itself still remains a distinct activity; the more so as it

operates in a peculiar element—that of danger.

Thus, if there was ever a need to distinguish between two activities, we

find it here. In order to indicate the practical importance of this idea, we
would suggest how often it is that the ablest man in one area is shown up as
the most useless pedant in another.

In fact, it is not at all difficult to consider these two activities separately if

one accepts the idea of an armed and equipped fighting force as given: a
means about which one does not need to know anything except its chief
effects in order to use it properly.

combat; there is no better term for it than the conduct of war. To be sure in
its wider sense the art of war includes all activities that exist for the sake of
war, such as the creation of the fighting forces, their raising, armament,
equipment, and training.

It is essential to the validity of a theory to distinguish between these two

activities. It is easy to see that if the art of war were always to start with
raising armed forces and adapting them to the requirements of the particular
case, it would be applicable only to those few instances where the forces
available exactly matched the need. If, on the other hand, one wants a
theory that is valid for the great majority of cases and not completely
unsuitable for any, it must be based on the most prevalent means and their
most significant effects.

The conduct of war, then, consists in the planning and conduct of

fighting. If fighting consisted of a single act, no further subdivision would
be needed. However, it consists of a greater or lesser number of single acts,
each complete in itself, which, as we pointed out in Chapter 1 of Book I,78

are called “engagements” and which form new entities. This gives rise to
the completely different activity of planning 
and 
executing 
these

engagements themselves, and of coordinating each of them with the others
in order to further the object of the war. One has been called tactics, and the
other strategy.

The distinction between tactics and strategy is now almost universal, and

everyone knows fairly well where each particular factor belongs without
clearly understanding why. Whenever such categories are blindly used,
there must be a deep-seated reason for it. We have tried to discover the
distinction, and have to say that it was just this common usage that led to it.
We reject, on the other hand, the artificial definitions of certain writers,
since they find no reflection in general usage.

According to our classification, then, tactics teaches the use of armed

forces in the engagement; strategy, the use of engagements for the object of
the war.

The concept of a single or a self-contained engagement and the

conditions on which its unity depends can be more accurately defined only
when we examine it more closely. For the moment, it is enough to say that

in terms of space (that is, of simultaneous engagements) its unity is
bounded by the range of personal command. In terms of time, however
(that is, of a close succession of engagements) it lasts until the turning
point, which is characteristic of all engagements, has been passed.

engagements could perhaps also be regarded as a single one. But that will
not spoil our basis for classification, since the point is common to all
practical systems of classification where distinctions gradually merge on a
descending scale. Thus there may be individual acts which, without a shift
in point of view, may belong either to strategy or to tactics; for instance,
very extended positions that are little more than a chain of posts, or
arrangements for certain river-crossings.

fighting forces. But war is served by many activities that are quite different
from it; some closely related, others far removed. All these activities
concern the maintenance of the fighting forces. While their creation and
training precedes their use, maintenance is concurrent with and a necessary
condition for it. Strictly speaking, however, all these should be considered
as activities preparatory to battle, of the type that are so closely related to
the action that they are part of military operations and alternate with actual
utilization. So one is justified in excluding these as well as all other
preparatory activities from the narrower meaning of the art of war—the
actual conduct of war. Indeed, it is necessary to do this if theory is to serve
its principal purpose of discriminating between dissimilar elements. One
would not want to consider the whole business of maintenance and
administration as part of the actual conduct of war. While it may be in
constant interaction with the utilization of the troops, the two are essentially
very different.

engagement is defined as the only directly effective activity, the threads of
all other activities will be included because they all lead to combat. The
statement meant that all these activities are thus provided with a purpose,
which they will have to pursue in accordance with their individual laws. Let
us elaborate further on this subject.

Activities that exist in addition to the engagement differ widely.

it, while in another respect they serve to maintain the fighting forces. Others
are related to maintenance alone; which has an effect on combat only
because of its interaction with the outcome of the fighting.

camps, and billets: each concerns a separate phase of existence of the
troops, and when one thinks of troops, the idea of the engagement must
always be present.

services, and maintenance of arms and equipment.

in the course of an engagement (usually known as “deployment”)79 while
not entailing the actual use of weapons, is so closely and inescapably linked
with it as to be an integral part of what is considered an engagement. A
march that is not undertaken in the course of an engagement is simply the
execution of a strategic plan. The latter determines when, where and with
what forces an engagement is to be fought. The march is only the means of
carrying out this plan.

A march that is not part of an engagement is thus a tool of strategy, but it

is not a matter of strategy exclusively. Since the forces undertaking it may
at any time become involved in an engagement, the execution of the march
is subject to the laws of both tactics and strategy. If a column is ordered to
take a route on the near side of a river or a range of hills, that is a strategic
measure: it implies that if an engagement has to be fought in the course of
the march, one prefers to offer it on the near rather than the far side.

If on the other hand a column takes a route along a ridge instead of

following the road through a valley, or breaks up into several smaller
columns for the sake of convenience, these are tactical measures: they
concern the manner in which the forces are to be used in the event of an
engagement.

The internal order of march bears a constant relationship to readiness for

combat and is therefore of a tactical nature: it is nothing more than the first
preliminary disposition for a possible engagement.

The march is the tool by which strategy deploys its effective elements,

the engagements. But these often become apparent only in their effect, and

not in their actual course. Inevitably, therefore, in discussion the tool has
often been confused with the effective element. One speaks of decisive
skillful marches, and really means the combinations of engagements to
which they lead. This substitution of concept is too natural, and the brevity
of expression too desirable, to call for change. But it is only a telescoped
chain of ideas, and one must keep the proper meaning in mind to avoid
errors.

value irrespective of their tactical results. One works out marches and
maneuvers, achieves one’s objective without fighting an engagement, and
then deduces that it is possible to defeat the enemy without fighting. Only at
a later stage shall we be able to show the immense implications of this
mistake.

Although marching can be seen as an integral part of combat, it has

certain aspects that do not belong here, and that therefore are neither tactical
nor strategic. These include all measures taken solely for the convenience
of the troops, such as building roads and bridges, and so forth. These are
merely preconditions; under certain circumstances they may be closely
linked with the use of troops and be virtually identical with them—for
instance, when a bridge is built in full view of the enemy. But essentially
these activities are alien to the conduct of war, and the theory of the latter
does not cover them.

for action, as distinct from “billets.” Camps are places for rest and
recuperation, but they also imply strategic willingness to fight wherever
they may be. But their siting does determine the engagement’s basic lines—
a precondition of all defensive engagements. So they are essential parts
both of strategy and of tactics.

extensive recuperation. Like camps, they are therefore strategic in location
and extent, and tactical in their internal organization which is geared to
readiness for action.

As a rule, of course, camps and billets serve a purpose besides that of

resting the troops; they may, for instance, serve to protect a certain area or
maintain a position. But their purpose may simply be to rest the troops. We
have to remember that strategy may pursue a wide variety of objectives:

anything that seems to offer an advantage can be the purpose of an
engagement, and the maintenance of the instrument of war will often itself
become the object of a particular strategic combination.

not have strayed far afield: the use of troops is still the main concern, since
that is the point of their disposition anywhere in the theater of war.

for activities that do not constitute a use of the fighting forces, such as the
building of shelters, the pitching of tents, and supply and sanitary services.
These are neither tactical nor strategic in nature.

order of battle and therefore tactical, are not part of the conduct of war so
far as their actual construction is concerned. On the contrary, troops must
be taught the necessary skills and knowledge as part of their training, and
the theory of combat takes all that for granted.

Of the items wholly unconnected with engagements, serving only to

maintain the forces, supply is the one which most directly affects the
fighting. It takes place almost every day and affects every individual. Thus
it thoroughly permeates the strategic aspects of all military action. The
reason why we mention the strategic aspect is that in the course of a given
engagement supply will rarely tend to cause an alteration of plans—though
such a change remains perfectly possible. Interaction therefore will be most
frequent between strategy and matters of supply, and nothing is more
common than to find considerations of supply affecting the strategic lines of
a campaign and a war. Still, no matter how frequent and decisive these
considerations may be, the business of supplying the troops remains an
activity essentially separate from their use; its influence shows in its results
alone.

The other administrative functions we have mentioned are even further

removed from the use of troops. Medical services, though they are vital to
an army’s welfare, affect it only through a small portion of its men, and
therefore exert only a weak and indirect influence on the utilization of the
rest. Maintenance of equipment, other than as a constant function of the
fighting forces, takes place only periodically, and will therefore rarely be
taken into account in strategic calculations.

At this point we must guard against a misunderstanding. In any

individual case these things may indeed be of decisive importance. The
distance of hospitals and supply depots may easily figure as the sole reason
for very important strategic decisions—a fact we do not want to deny or
minimize. However, we are not concerned with the actual circumstances of
any individual case, but with pure theory. Our contention therefore is that
this type of influence occurs so rarely that we should not give the theory of
medical services and replacement of munitions any serious weight in the
theory of the conduct of war. Unlike the supplying of the troops, therefore,
it would not seem worth while to incorporate the various ways and systems
those theories might suggest, and their results, into the theory of the
conduct of war.

split into two main categories: those that are merely preparations for war,
and war proper. The same distinction must be made in theory as well.

with the creation, training and maintenance of the fighting forces. It is
immaterial what label we give them, but they obviously must include such
matters as artillery, fortification, so-called elementary tactics, as well as all
the organization and administration of the fighting forces and the like. The
theory of war proper, on the other hand, is concerned with the use of these
means, once they have been developed, for the purposes of the war. All that
it requires from the first group is the end product, an understanding of their
main characteristics. That is what we call “the art of war” in a narrower
sense, or “the theory of the conduct of war,” or “the theory of the use of the
fighting forces.” For our purposes, they all mean the same thing.

That narrower theory, then, deals with the engagement, with fighting

itself, and treats such matters as marches, camps, and billets as conditions
that may be more or less identical with it. It does not comprise questions of
supply, but will take these into account on the same basis as other given
factors.

The art of war in the narrower sense must now in its turn be broken down

into tactics and strategy. The first is concerned with the form of the
individual engagement, the second with its use. Both affect the conduct of
marches, camps, and billets only through the engagement; they become

tactical or strategic questions insofar as they concern either the
engagement’s form or its significance.

strategy, because they do not directly affect the conduct of operations.
Admittedly only the rankest pedant would expect theoretical distinctions to
show direct results on the battlefield.

concepts have been defined can one hope to make any progress in
examining the question clearly and simply and expect the reader to share
one’s views. Tactics and strategy are two activities that permeate one
another in time and space but are nevertheless essentially different. Their
inherent laws and mutual relationship cannot be understood without a total
comprehension of both.

because this subject has seldom been examined in a spirit of scientific
investigation.

PROBLEMS FACING THEORY WHEN MORAL FACTORS

ARE INVOLVED

Medicine is usually concerned only with physical phenomena. It deals

with the animal organism, which, however, is subject to constant change,
and thus is never exactly the same from one moment to the next. This
renders the task of medicine very difficult, and makes the physician’s
judgment count for more than his knowledge. But how greatly is the
difficulty increased when a mental factor is added, and how much more
highly do we value the psychiatrist!

OceanofPDF.com

MORAL VALUES CANNOT BE IGNORED IN WAR

But moral values can only be perceived by the inner eye, which differs in

each person, and is often different in the same person at different times.

Since danger is the common element in which everything moves in war,

courage, the sense of one’s own strength, is the principal factor that
influences judgment. It is the lens, so to speak, through which impressions
pass to the brain.

And yet there can be no doubt that experience will by itself provide a

degree of objectivity to these impressions.

Everyone knows the moral effects of an ambush or an attack in flank or

rear. Everyone rates the enemy’s bravery lower once his back is turned, and
takes much greater risks in pursuit than while being pursued. Everyone
gauges his opponent in the light of his reputed talents, his age, and his
experience, and acts accordingly. Everyone tries to assess the spirit and
temper of his own troops and of the enemy’s. All these and similar effects
in the sphere of mind and spirit have been proved by experience: they recur
constantly, and are therefore entitled to receive their due as objective
factors. What indeed would become of a theory that ignored them?

Of course these truths must be rooted in experience. No theorist, and no

commander, should bother himself with psychological and philosophical
sophistries.

PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS IN FORMULATING A THEORY

OF THE CONDUCT OF WAR

OceanofPDF.com

FIRST PROPERTY: MORAL FORCES AND EFFECTS

HOSTILE FEELINGS

Essentially combat is an expression of hostile feelings. But in the large-

scale combat that we call war hostile feelings often have become merely
hostile intentions. At any rate there are usually no hostile feelings between
individuals. Yet such emotions can never be completely absent from war.
Modern wars are seldom fought without hatred between nations; this serves
more or less as a substitute for hatred between individuals. Even where
there is no national hatred and no animosity to start with, the fighting itself
will stir up hostile feelings: violence committed on superior orders will stir
up the desire for revenge and retaliation against the perpetrator rather than
against the powers that ordered the action. That is only human (or animal, if
you like), but it is a fact. Theorists are apt to look on fighting in the abstract
as a trial of strength without emotion entering into it. This is one of a
thousand errors which they quite consciously commit because they have no
idea of the implications.

Apart from emotions stimulated by the nature of combat, there are others

that are not so intimately linked with fighting; but because of a certain
affinity, they are easily associated with fighting: ambition, love of power,
enthusiasms of all kinds, and so forth.

A POSITIVE DOCTRINE IS UNATTAINABLE

OceanofPDF.com

ALTERNATIVES WHICH MAKE A THEORY POSSIBLE

THE DIFFICULTIES VARY IN MAGNITUDE

In the first place, our comments on the nature of military activity in

general should not be taken as applying equally to action at all levels. What
is most needed in the lower ranks is courage and self-sacrifice, but there are
far fewer problems to be solved by intelligence and judgment. The field of
action is more limited, means and ends are fewer in number, and the data
more concrete: usually they are limited to what is actually visible. But the
higher the rank, the more the problems multiply, reaching their highest
point in the supreme commander. At this level, almost all solutions must be
left to imaginative intellect.

Even if we break down war into its various activities, we will find that

the difficulties are not uniform throughout. The more physical the activity,
the less the difficulties will be. The more the activity becomes intellectual
and turns into motives which exercise a determining influence on the
commander’s will, the more the difficulties will increase. Thus it is easier to
use theory to organize, plan, and conduct an engagement than it is to use it
in determining the engagement’s purpose. Combat is conducted with
physical weapons, and although the intellect does play a part, material
factors will dominate. But when one comes to the effect of the engagement,
where material successes turn into motives for further action, the intellect
alone is decisive. In brief, tactics will present far fewer difficulties to the
theorist than will strategy.

OceanofPDF.com

THEORY SHOULD BE STUDY, NOT DOCTRINE

A specialist who has spent half his life trying to master every aspect of

some obscure subject is surely more likely to make headway than a man
who is trying to master it in a short time. Theory exists so that one need not
start afresh each time sorting out the material and plowing through it, but
will find it ready to hand and in good order. It is meant to educate the mind
of the future commander, or, more accurately, to guide him in his self-
education, not to accompany him to the battlefield; just as a wise teacher

guides and stimulates a young man’s intellectual development, but is careful
not to lead him by the hand for the rest of his life.

If the theorist’s studies automatically result in principles and rules, and if

truth spontaneously crystallizes into these forms, theory will not resist this
natural tendency of the mind. On the contrary, where the arch of truth
culminates in such a keystone, this tendency will be underlined. But this is
simply in accordance with the scientific law of reason, to indicate the point
at which all lines converge, but never to construct an algebraic formula for
use on the battlefield. Even these principles and rules are intended to
provide a thinking man with a frame of reference for the movements he has
been trained to carry out, rather than to serve as a guide which at the
moment of action lays down precisely the path he must take.

THEORY THUS STUDIES THE NATURE OF ENDS AND

MEANS

ENDS AND MEANS IN TACTICS

In tactics the means are the fighting forces trained for combat; the end is

victory. A more precise definition of this concept will be offered later on, in
the context of “the engagement.” Here, it is enough to say that the enemy’s
withdrawal from the battlefield is the sign of victory. Strategy thereby gains
the end it had ascribed to the engagement, the end that constitutes its real
significance. This significance admittedly will exert a certain influence on
the kind of victory achieved. A victory aimed at weakening the enemy’s
fighting forces is different from one that is only meant to seize a certain
position. The significance of an engagement may therefore have a
noticeable influence on its planning and conduct, and is therefore to be
studied in connection with tactics.

OceanofPDF.com

THE NATURE OF SUCH KNOWLEDGE

The knowledge needed by a senior commander is distinguished by the

fact that it can only be attained by a special talent, through the medium of
reflection, study and thought: an intellectual instinct which extracts the
essence from the phenomena of life, as a bee sucks honey from a flower. In
addition to study and reflection, life itself serves as a source. Experience,
with its wealth of lessons, will never produce a Newton or an Euler, but it
may well bring forth the higher calculations of a Condé or a Frederick.

To save the intellectual repute of military activity there is no need to

resort to lies and simple-minded pedantry. No great commander was ever a
man of limited intellect. But there are numerous cases of men who served
with the greatest distinction in the lower ranks and turned out barely
mediocre in the highest commands, because their intellectual powers were
inadequate. Even among commanders-in-chief a distinction must of course
be made according to the extent of their authority.

OceanofPDF.com

KNOWLEDGE MUST BECOME CAPABILITY

These observations have, we believe, clarified the problems that confront

any theory of warfare, and suggested an approach to its solution.

We have divided the conduct of war into the two fields of tactics and

strategy. The theory of the latter, as we have already stated, will
unquestionably encounter the greater problems since the former is virtually
limited to material factors, whereas for strategic theory, dealing as it does
with ends which bear directly on the restoration of peace, the range of
possibilities is unlimited. As these ends will have to be considered primarily

by the commander-in-chief, the problems mainly arise in those fields that lie
within his competence.

In the field of strategy, therefore, even more than in tactics, theory will be

content with the simple consideration of material and psychological factors,
especially where it embraces the highest of achievements. It will be
sufficient if it helps the commander acquire those insights that, once
absorbed into his way of thinking, will smooth and protect his progress, and
will never force him to abandon his convictions for the sake of any
objective fact.

This difficulty was already recognized in the past, and it was therefore

suggested that war was a craft. That, however, proved more of a loss than a
gain, because a craft is simply an inferior form of art and as such subject to
stricter and more rigorous laws. Actually, there was a time—the age of the
condottieri—when the art of war was akin to a craft. But this tendency had
no internal, only an external basis. Military history shows how unnatural
and unsatisfactory it turned out to be.

WAR IS AN ACT OF HUMAN INTERCOURSE

OceanofPDF.com

DIFFERENCE

Part of the object of this book is to examine whether a conflict of living

forces as it develops and is resolved in war remains subject to general laws,
and whether these can provide a useful guide to action. This much is clear:
this subject, like any other that does not surpass man’s intellectual capacity,
can be elucidated by an inquiring mind, and its internal structure can to
some degree be revealed. That alone is enough to turn the concept of theory
into reality.

OceanofPDF.com

Law is the broadest concept applicable to both perception and action. In

its literal sense the term obviously contains a subjective, arbitrary element,
and yet it expresses the very thing on which man and his environment
essentially depend. Viewed as a matter of cognition, law is the relationship
between things and their effects. Viewed as a matter of the will, law is a
determinant of action; at that point, it is synonymous with decree and
prohibition.

Principle is also a law for action, but not in its formal, definitive

meaning; it represents only the spirit and the sense of the law: in cases
where the diversity of the real world cannot be contained within the rigid
form of law, the application of principle allows for a greater latitude of
judgment. Cases to which principle cannot be applied must be settled by
judgment; principle thus becomes essentially a support, or lodestar, to the
man responsible for the action.

A principle is objective if it rests on objective truth and is therefore

equally valid for all; it is subjective and is generally called a maxim if
subjective considerations enter into it. In that case it has value only for the
person who adopts it.

Rule is a term often used in the sense of law; it then becomes

synonymous with principle. The proverb goes “there is an exception to
every rule” and not “to every law,” which shows that in the case of a rule
one reserves the right to a more liberal interpretation.

In another sense, the term “rule” is used for “means”: to recognize an

underlying truth through a single obviously relevant feature enables us to

derive a general law of action from this feature. Rules in games are like
this, and so are the short cuts used in mathematics, and so on.

more detailed circumstances, too numerous and too trivial for general laws.

procedure that has been selected from several possibilities. It becomes
routine when action is prescribed by method rather than by general
principles or individual regulation. It must necessarily be assumed that all
cases to which such a routine is applied will be essentially alike. Since this
will not be entirely so, it is important that it be true of at least as many as
possible. In other words, methodical procedure should be designed to meet
the most probable cases. Routine is not based on definite individual
premises, but rather on the average probability of analogous cases. Its aim
is to postulate an average truth, which, when applied evenly and constantly,
will soon acquire some of the nature of a mechanical skill, which eventually
does the right thing almost automatically.

In the conduct of war, perception cannot be governed by laws: the

complex phenomena of war are not so uniform, nor the uniform phenomena
so complex, as to make laws more useful than the simple truth. Where a
simple point of view and plain language are sufficient, it would be pedantic
and affected to make them complex and involved. Nor can the theory of war
apply the concept of law to action, since no prescriptive formulation
universal enough to deserve the name of law can be applied to the constant
change and diversity of the phenomena of war.

concepts to or for that part of the theory of war that leads to positive
doctrines; for in these doctrines the truth can express itself only in such
compressed forms.

of war in which theory can develop most fully into a positive doctrine.
Some examples of tactical principles are: except in emergencies cavalry is
not to be used against unbroken infantry; firearms should not be used until
the enemy is within effective range; in combat, as many troops as possible
should be preserved for the final phase. None of these concepts can be
dogmatically applied to every situation, but a commander must always bear

them in mind so as not to lose the benefit of the truth they contain in cases
where they do apply.

move. The, intentional exposure of troops in combat indicates a feint. This
manner of inferring the truth may be called a rule because one deduces the
enemy’s intentions from a single visible fact connected with them.

he starts to withdraw his artillery, then a whole course of action is
determined by this single phenomenon which has revealed his entire
condition: the fact that he is ready to give up the fight. While he is doing so,
he cannot offer serious resistance or even avoid action as he could once he
is fully on the move.

as active principles, theoretical preparation for war is part of its actual
conduct. All standing instructions on formations, drill, and field-service are
regulations and methods. Drill instructions are mainly regulations; field
manuals, mainly methods. The actual conduct of war is based on these
things; they are accepted as given procedures and as such must have their
place in the theory of the conduct of war.

In the employment of these forces, some activities remain a matter of

choice. Regulations, or prescriptive directions, do not apply to them,
precisely because regulations preclude freedom of choice. Routines, on the
other hand, represent a general way of executing tasks as they arise based,
as we have said, on average probability. They represent the dominance of
principles and rules, carried through to actual application. As such they may
well have a place in the theory of the conduct of war, provided they are not
falsely represented as absolute, binding frameworks for action (systems);
rather they are the best of the general forms, short cuts, and options that
may be substituted for individual decisions.

The frequent application of routine in war will also appear essential and

inevitable when we consider how often action is based on pure conjecture
or takes place in complete ignorance, either because the enemy prevents us
from knowing all the circumstances that might affect our dispositions, or
because there is not enough time. Even if we did know all the
circumstances, their implications and complexities would not permit us to
take the necessary steps to deal with them. Therefore our measures must

always be determined by a limited number of possibilities. We have to
remember the countless minor factors implicit in every case. The only
possible way of dealing with them is to treat each case as implying all the
others, and base our dispositions on the general and the probable. Finally
we have to remember that as the number of officers increases steadily in the
lower ranks, the less the trust that can be placed on their true insight and
mature judgment. Officers whom one should not expect to have any greater
understanding than regulations and experience can give them have to be
helped along by routine methods tantamount to rules. These will steady
their judgment, and also guard them against eccentric and mistaken
schemes, which are the greatest menace in a field where experience is so
dearly bought.

the summit, it disappears completely. Consequently, it is more appropriate

analogous despite their diversities, which can be controlled with greater or
lesser effectiveness depending on the methods applied. War consists rather
of single, great decisive actions, each of which needs to be handled
individually. War is not like a field of wheat, which, without regard to the
individual stalk, may be mown more or less efficiently depending on the
quality of the scythe; it is like a stand of mature trees in which the axe has
to be used judiciously according to the characteristics and development of
each individual trunk.

determined not by rank but by the nature of each situation. The highest
ranks are least affected by it simply because the scope of their operations is
the most comprehensive. A standard order of battle or system of advance
guards and outposts are methods by which a general may be fettering not
only his subordinates, but, in certain cases, also himself. Of course these
methods may be his own inventions, and adapted to particular conditions; to
the extent that they are based on the general properties of troops and

weapons, they can also be a subject of theory. But any method by which
strategic plans are turned out ready-made, as if from some machine, must
be totally rejected.

So long as no acceptable theory, no intelligent analysis of the conduct of

war exists, routine methods will tend to take over even at the highest levels.
Some of the men in command have not had the opportunities of self-
improvement afforded by education and contact with the higher levels of
society and government. They cannot cope with the impractical and
contradictory arguments of theorists and critics even though their common
sense rejects them. Their only insights are those that have been gained by
experience. For this reason, they prefer to use the means with which their
experience has equipped them, even in cases that could and should be
handled freely and individually. They will copy their supreme commander’s
favorite device—thus automatically creating a new routine. When we find
generals under Frederick the Great using the so-called oblique order of
battle; generals of the French Revolution using turning movements with a
much extended front; and commanders under Bonaparte attacking with a
brutal rush of concentric masses, then we recognize in these repetitions a
ready-made method, and see that even the highest ranks are not above the
influence of routine. Once an improved theory helps the study of the
conduct of war, and educates the mind and judgment of the senior
commanders, routine methods will no longer reach so high. Those types of
routine that must be considered indispensable will then at least be based on
a theory rather than consist in sheer imitation. No matter how superbly a
great commander operates, there is always a subjective element in his work.
If he displays a certain style, it will in large part reflect his own personality;
but that will not always blend with the personality of the man who copies
that style.

routine or personal style entirely from the conduct of war. They should be
seen, rather, as manifestations of the influence exerted on individual
phenomena by the total character of the war—an influence which, if it has
not been foreseen and allowed for by accepted theory, may find no other
means of adequate expression. What could be more natural than the fact
that the War of the French Revolution had its characteristic style, and what
theory could have been expected to accommodate it? The danger is that this

kind of style, developed out of a single case, can easily outlive the situation
that gave rise to it; for conditions change imperceptibly. That danger is the
very thing a theory should prevent by lucid, rational criticism. When in
1806 the Prussian generals, Prince Louis at Saalfeld, Tauentzien on the
Dornberg near Jena, Grawert on one side of Kapellendorf and Rüchel on the
other, plunged into the open jaws of disaster by using Frederick the Great’s
oblique order of battle, it was not just a case of a style that had outlived its
usefulness but the most extreme poverty of the imagination to which routine
has ever led. The result was that the Prussian army under Hohenlohe was
ruined more completely than any army has ever been ruined on the
battlefield.

We distinguish between the critical approach and the plain narrative of a

historical event, which merely arranges facts one after another, and at most
touches on their immediate causal links.

Three different intellectual activities may be contained in the critical

approach.

First, the discovery and interpretation of equivocal facts. This is

historical research proper, and has nothing in common with theory.

Second, the tracing of effects back to their causes. This is critical

analysis proper. It is essential for theory; for whatever in theory is to be
defined, supported, or simply described by reference to experience can only
be dealt with in this manner.

Third, the investigation and evaluation of means employed. This last is

criticism proper, involving praise and censure. Here theory serves history,
or rather the lessons to be drawn from history.

In the last two activities which are the truly critical parts of historical

inquiry, it is vital to analyze everything down to its basic elements, to
incontrovertible truth. One must not stop half-way, as is so often done, at
some arbitrary assumption or hypothesis.

The deduction of effect from cause is often blocked by some insuperable

extrinsic obstacle: the true causes may be quite unknown. Nowhere in life is
this so common as in war, where the facts are seldom fully known and the
underlying motives even less so. They may be intentionally concealed by

those in command, or, if they happen to be transitory and accidental, history
may not have recorded them at all. That is why critical narrative must
usually go hand in hand with historical research. Even so, the disparity
between cause and effect may be such that the critic is not justified in
considering the effects as inevitable results of known causes. This is bound
to produce gaps—historical results that yield no useful lesson. All a theory
demands is that investigation should be resolutely carried on till such a gap
is reached. At that point, judgment has to be suspended. Serious trouble
arises only when known facts are forcibly stretched to explain effects; for
this confers on these facts a spurious importance.

Apart from that problem, critical research is faced with a serious intrinsic

one: effects in war seldom result from a single cause; there are usually
several concurrent causes. It is therefore not enough to trace, however
honestly and objectively, a sequence of events back to their origin: each
identifiable cause still has to be correctly assessed. This leads to a closer
analysis of the nature of these causes, and in this way critical investigation
gets us into theory proper.

to what are the peculiar effects of the means employed, and whether these
effects conform to the intention with which they were used.

nature—in other words, into the realm of theory again.

We have seen that in criticism it is vital to reach the point of

incontrovertible truth; we must never stop at an arbitrary assumption that
others may not accept, lest different propositions, equally valid perhaps, be
advanced against them; leading to an unending argument, reaching no
conclusions, and resulting in no lesson.

of the means leads to the realm of theory—that is, to the field of universal
truth that cannot be inferred merely from the individual instance under
study. If a usable theory does indeed exist, the inquiry can refer to its
conclusions and at that point end the investigation. However, where such
theoretical criteria do not exist, analysis must be pressed until the basic
elements are reached. If this happens often, it will lead the writer into a
labyrinth of detail: he will have his hands full and find it almost impossible
to give each point the attention it demands. As a result, in order to set a

limit to his inquiries, he will have to stop short of arbitrary assumptions
after all. Even if they would not seem arbitrary to him, they would to others,
because they are neither self-evident nor have they been proved.

a theory it is generally impossible for criticism to reach that point at which
it becomes truly instructive—when its arguments are convincing and cannot
be refuted.

every abstract truth, so that all the critic had to do would be to classify the
case studied under the appropriate heading. Equally, it would be ridiculous
to expect criticism to reverse course whenever it came up against the limits
of a sacrosanct theory. The same spirit of analytical investigation which
creates a theory should also guide the work of the critic who both may and
should often cross into the realm of theory in order to elucidate any points
of special importance. The function of criticism would be missed entirely if
criticism were to degenerate into a mechanical application of theory. All the
positive results of theoretical investigation—all the principles, rules, and
methods—will increasingly lack universality and absolute truth the closer
they come to being positive doctrine. They are there to be used when
needed, and their suitability in any given case must always be a matter of
judgment. A critic should never use the results of theory as laws and
standards, but only—as the soldier does—as aids to judgment. If, in tactics,
it is generally agreed that in the standard line of battle cavalry should be
posted not in line with but behind the infantry, it would nevertheless be
foolish to condemn every different deployment simply because it is
different. The critic should analyze the reasons for the exception. He has no
right to appeal to theoretical principles unless these reasons are inadequate.
Again, if theory lays it down that an attack with divided forces reduces the
probability of success, it would be equally unreasonable, without further
analysis, to attribute failure to the separation of forces whenever both occur
together; or when an attack with divided forces is successful to conclude
that the original theoretical assertion was incorrect. The inquiring nature of
criticism can permit neither. In short, criticism largely depends on the
results of the theorist’s analytic studies. What theory has already established
the critic need not go over again, and it is the theorist’s function to provide
the critic with these findings.

appropriateness of means to ends will be easy when cause and effect, means
and ends, are closely linked.

When a surprise attack renders an army incapable of employing its

powers in an orderly and rational manner, then the effect of the surprise
cannot be questioned. When theory has established that an enveloping
attack leads to greater, if less certain, success, we have to ask whether the
general who used this envelopment was primarily concerned with the
magnitude of success. If so, he chose the right way to go about it. But if he
used it in order to make more certain of success, basing his action not so
much on individual circumstances as on the general nature of enveloping
attacks, as has happened innumerable times, then he misunderstood the
nature of the means he chose and committed an error.

The business of critical analysis and proof is not very difficult in cases of

this kind; it is bound to be easy if one restricts oneself to the most
immediate aims and effects. This may be done quite arbitrarily if one
isolates the matter from its setting and studies it only under those
conditions.

But in war, as in life generally, all parts of a whole are interconnected and

thus the effects produced, however small their cause, must influence all
subsequent military operations and modify their final outcome to some
degree, however slight. In the same way, every means must influence even
the ultimate purpose.

seems worth while. In the same way, a means may be evaluated, not merely
with respect to its immediate end: that end itself should be appraised as a
means for the next and highest one; and thus we can follow a chain of
sequential objectives until we reach one that requires no justification,
because its necessity is self-evident. In many cases, particularly those
involving great and decisive actions, the analysis must extend to the
ultimate objective, which is to bring about peace.

Every stage in this progression obviously implies a new basis for

judgment. That which seems correct when looked at from one level may,
when viewed from a higher one, appear objectionable.

In a critical analysis of the action, the search for the causes of phenomena

and the testing of means in relation to ends always go hand in hand, for

only the search for a cause will reveal the questions that need to be studied.

The pursuit of this chain, upward and downward, presents considerable

problems. The greater the distance between the event and the cause that we
are seeking, the larger the number of other causes that have to be considered
at the same time. Their possible influence on events has to be established
and allowed for, since the greater the magnitude of any event, the wider the
range of forces and circumstances that affect it. When the causes for the
loss of a battle have been ascertained, we shall admittedly also know some
of the causes of the effects that this lost battle had upon the whole—but
only some, since the final outcome will have been affected by other causes
as well.

viewpoint becomes more comprehensive. The higher the ends, the greater
the number of means by which they may be reached. The final aim of the
war is pursued by all armies simultaneously, and we therefore have to
consider the full extent of everything that has happened, or might have
happened.

inquiry in which we may easily get lost. A great many assumptions have to
be made about things that did not actually happen but seemed possible, and
that, therefore, cannot be left out of account.

Tagliamento to meet the Archduke Charles, their object was to force a
decision on the Austrians before the arrival of their reinforcements from the
Rhine. If we consider only the immediate objective, the means were well-
chosen, as the result showed. The Archduke’s forces were still so weak that
he made only an attempt at resistance on the Tagliamento. On seeing the
strength and resolution of his enemy, he abandoned the area and the
approaches to the Norican Alps. How could Bonaparte make use of this
success? Should he press on into the heart of the Austrian Empire, ease the
advance of the two armies of the Rhine under Moreau and Hoche, and work
in close conjunction with them? That was how Bonaparte saw it, and from
his point of view he was right. But the critic may take a wider view—that of
the French Directory; whose members could see, and must have realized,
that the campaign on the Rhine would not begin for another six weeks.
From that standpoint, then, Bonaparte’s advance through the Norican Alps

could only be considered an unjustifiable risk. If the Austrians had moved
sizable reserves from the Rhine to Styria with which the Archduke Charles
could have attacked the Army of Italy, not only would that Army have been
destroyed, but the entire campaign would have been lost. Bonaparte
realized this by the time he reached Villach, and this persuaded him to sign
the Armistice of Leoben with alacrity.

If the critic takes a still wider view, he can see that the Austrians had no

reserves between the Archduke’s army and Vienna, and that the advance of
the Army of Italy was a threat to the capital itself.

own superiority over the Archduke even in Styria to be decisive. His rapid
advance into the heart of Austria would then no longer have been pointless.
The value of the attack would now depend merely on the value the
Austrians set on the retention of Vienna. If, rather than lose the capital, they
would accept whatever conditions for peace Bonaparte offered them, the
threat to Vienna could be considered as his final aim. If Bonaparte had
somehow known of this, the critic would have no more to say. But if the
issue was still uncertain, the critic must take a more comprehensive point of
view, and ask what would have happened if the Austrians had abandoned
Vienna, and withdrawn into the vast expanse of territory they still
controlled. That, however, is obviously a question which cannot possibly be
answered without reference to the probable encounter between the two
armies on the Rhine. There the French were so decisively superior in
numbers—130,000 against 80,000—that the issue would not have been
much in doubt. But then the question would again have arisen, what use
would the French Directory have made of the victory? Would the French
have pursued their advantage to the far frontiers of the Austrian monarchy,
breaking Austrian power and shattering the Empire, or would they have
been satisfied with the conquest of a sizable part of it as a surety for peace?
We have to ascertain the probable consequences of both possibilities before
determining the probable choice of the Directory. Let us assume that this
consideration led to the answer that the French forces were far too weak to
bring about the total collapse of Austria, so that the mere attempt to do so
would have reversed the situation and even the conquest and occupation of
a significant segment of Austrian territory would have placed the French in
a strategic situation with which their forces could hardly have coped. This

argument would have colored their view of the situation in which the Army
of Italy found itself, and reduced its likely prospects. No doubt this is what
persuaded Bonaparte, although he realized the Archduke’s hopeless
situation, to sign the peace of Campo Formio, on conditions that imposed
on the Austrians no greater sacrifices than the loss of some provinces which
even the most successful campaign could not have recovered. But the
French could not have counted even on the moderate gains of Campo
Formio, and therefore could not have made them the objectives of their
offensive, had it not been for two considerations. The first was the value the
Austrians placed on the two possible outcomes. Though both of them made
eventual success appear probable, would the Austrians have thought it
worth the sacrifices they entailed—the continuation of the war—when that
price could have been avoided by concluding a peace on not too
unfavorable terms? The second consideration consists in the question
whether the Austrian government would even pursue its reflections and
thoroughly evaluate the potential limits of French success, rather than be
disheartened by the impression of current reverses?

contrary, it is of such decisive practical importance that it always arises
whenever one aims at total victory. It is this which usually prevents such
plans from being carried out.

The second consideration is just as essential, for war is not waged against

an abstract enemy, but against a real one who must always be kept in mind.
Certainly a man as bold as Bonaparte was conscious of this, confident as he
was in the terror inspired by his approach. The same confidence led him to
Moscow in 1812, but there it left him. In the course of the gigantic battles,
the terror had already been somewhat blunted. But in 1797 it was still fresh,
and the secret of the effectiveness of resisting to the last had not yet been
discovered. Still, even in 1797 his boldness would have had a negative
result if he had not, as we have seen, sensed the risk involved and chosen
the moderate peace of Campo Formio as an alternative.

We must now break off this discussion. It will suffice to show the

comprehensive, intricate and difficult character which a critical analysis
may assume if it extends to ultimate objectives—in other words, if it deals
with the great and decisive measures which must necessarily lead up to
them. It follows that in addition to theoretical insight into the subject,

natural talent will greatly enhance the value of critical analysis: for it will
primarily depend on such talent to illuminate the connections which link
things together and to determine which among the countless concatenations
of events are the essential ones.

just an evaluation of the means actually employed, but of all possible means
—which first have to be formulated, that is, invented. One can, after all, not
condemn a method without being able to suggest a better alternative. No
matter how small the range of possible combinations may be in most cases,
it cannot be denied that listing those that have not been used is not a mere
analysis of existing things but an achievement that cannot be performed to
order since it depends on the creativity of the intellect. We are far from
suggesting that the realm of true genius is to be found in cases where a
handful of simple, practical schemes account for everything. In our view it
is quite absurd, though it is often done, to treat the turning of a position as
an invention of great genius. And yet such individual creative evaluations
are necessary, and they significantly influence the value of critical analysis.

order to meet Wurmser’s advance, and fell with his entire strength on each
of the latter’s columns separately while they were divided by Lake Garda
and the Mincio, he did so because this seemed the surest way to decisive
victories. These victories in fact did occur, and were repeated even more
decisively in the same way against later attempts to relieve Mantua. There
is only one opinion about this: unbounded admiration.

And yet, Bonaparte could not choose this course on 30 July without

renouncing all hope of taking the city; for it was impossible to save the
siege train, and it could not be replaced during the current campaign. In
point of fact, the siege turned into a mere blockade and the city, which
would have fallen within a week if the siege had been maintained, held out
for six more months despite all Bonaparte’s victories in the field.

Critics, unable to recommend a better way of resistance, have considered

this an unavoidable misfortune. Resisting a relieving army behind lines of
circumvallation had fallen into such disrepute and contempt that it occurred
to no one. And vet in the days of Louis XIV it had so often been
successfully employed that one can only call it a whim of fashion that a
hundred years later it never occurred to anyone at least to weigh its merits.

If that possibility had been admitted, closer scrutiny of the situation would
have shown that 40,000 of the finest infantrymen in the world whom
Bonaparte could have placed behind a line of circumvallation at Mantua,
would, if they were well entrenched, have had so little cause to fear the
50,000 Austrians whom Wurmser was bringing to relieve the town, that the
lines were in little danger even of being attacked. This is not the place to
labor the point; we believe we have said enough to show that the possibility
deserved notice. We cannot tell whether Bonaparte himself ever considered
the plan. There is no trace of it in his memoirs and the rest of the published
sources; none of the later critics touched upon it, because they were no
longer in the habit of considering this scheme. There is no great merit in
recalling its existence; one only has to shed the tyranny of fashion in order
to think of it. One does, however, have to think of it in order to consider it
and to compare it with the means which Bonaparte in fact employed.
Whatever the result of this comparison the critic should not fail to make it.

turned from Blücher after beating him at Etoges, Champ-Aubert,
Montmirail, and elsewhere, to fall on Schwarzenberg, and beat him at
Montereau and Mormant. By rapidly moving his main force back and forth,
Bonaparte brilliantly exploited the allies’ mistake of advancing with divided
forces. If, people thought, these superb strokes in all directions failed to
save him, at least it was not his fault. No one has yet asked what would
have happened if, instead of turning away from Blücher, and back to
Schwarzenberg, he had gone on hammering Blücher and had pursued him
back to the Rhine. We are convinced that the complexion of the whole
campaign would have been changed and that, instead of marching on Paris,
the allied armies would have withdrawn across the Rhine. We do not
require others to share our view, but no expert can doubt that the critic is
bound to consider that alternative once it has been raised.

Nevertheless it has been overlooked, because people are biased and blindly
follow a single line of thought.

The need for suggesting a better method than the one that is condemned

has created the type of criticism which is used almost exclusively: the critic
thinks he must only indicate the method which he considers to be better,
without having to furnish proof. In consequence not everyone is convinced;

others follow the same procedure, and a controversy starts without any
basis for discussion. The whole literature on war is full of this kind of thing.

means suggested is not plain enough to rule out all doubts; it consists in
taking each of the means and assessing and comparing the particular merits
of each in relation to the objective. Once the matter has thus been reduced
to simple truths, the controversy must either stop, or at least lead to new
results. By the other method, the pros and cons simply cancel out.

been satisfied, and wanted to prove that the relentless pursuit of Blücher
would have served Napoleon better than turning against Schwarzenberg.
We would rely on the following simple truths:

1. Generally speaking, it is better to go on striking in the same direction

than to move one’s forces this way and that, because shifting troops
back and forth involves losing time. Moreover, it is easier to achieve
further successes where the enemy’s morale has already been shaken
by substantial losses; in this way, none of the superiority that has been
attained will go unexploited.

2. Even though Blücher was weaker than Schwarzenberg, his enterprising

spirit made him more important. The center of gravity lay with him,
and he pulled the other forces in his direction.

3. The losses Blücher suffered were on the scale of a serious defeat.

Bonaparte had thus gained so great a superiority over him as to leave
no doubt that he would have to retreat as far as the Rhine, for no
reserves of any consequence were stationed on that route.

4. No other possible success could have caused so much alarm or so

impressed the allies’ mind. With a staff which was known to be as
timid and irresolute as Schwarzenberg’s, this was bound to be an
important consideration. The losses incurred by the Crown Prince of
Württemberg at Montereau and by Count Wittgenstein at Mormant
were sure to be fairly well known to Prince Schwarzenberg; on the
other hand, news of the misfortunes that Blücher met with along his
distant and discontinuous line between the Marne and the Rhine could
have reached him only as an avalanche of rumors. Bonaparte’s
desperate thrust toward Vitry at the end of March was an attempt to

test the effect that the threat of a strategic envelopment would have on
the allies. It was obviously based on the principle of terror, but in
wholly different circumstances now that Bonaparte had been defeated
at Laon and Arcis, and Blücher had joined Schwarzenberg with
100,000 men.

 
Some people, of course, will not be convinced by these arguments, but at

least they will not be able to reply that “as Bonaparte, in his thrust towards
the Rhine, was threatening Schwarzenberg’s base, so Schwarzenberg was
threatening Paris, which was Bonaparte’s.” The reasons we have cited
above should make it clear that it would not have occurred to
Schwarzenberg to advance on Paris.

In the instance from 1796 which we have touched on above we would

say that Bonaparte considered the plan that he adopted as the one best
guaranteed to beat the Austrians. Even if this had been true, the outcome
would have been an empty triumph which could hardly have significantly
affected the fall of Mantua. Our own proposal would have been much more
likely to prevent Mantua from being relieved; but even if we put ourselves
in Bonaparte’s place and take the opposite view—that it offered a smaller
prospect of success—the choice would have been based on balancing a
likelier but almost useless, and therefore minor, victory against a less likely
but far greater one. If the matter is looked at in that light, boldness would
surely have opted for the second course: but looked at superficially, the
opposite was what occurred. Bonaparte certainly held to the bolder
intention, so there can be no doubt that he did not think the matter through
to the point where he could assess the consequences as fully as we can in
the light of experience.

In the study of means, the critic must naturally frequently refer to

military history, for in the art of war experience counts more than any
amount of abstract truths. Historical proof is subject to conditions of its
own, which will be dealt with in a separate chapter; but unfortunately these
conditions are so seldom met with that historical references usually only
confuse matters more.

Another important point must now be considered: how far is the critic

free, or even duty-bound, to assess a single case in the light of his greater
knowledge, including as it does a knowledge of the outcome? Or when and

where should he ignore these things in order to place himself exactly in the
situation of the man in command?

put himself exactly in the position of the commander; in other words, he
must assemble everything the commander knew and all the motives that
affected his decision, and ignore all that he could not or did not know,
especially the outcome. However, this is only an ideal to be aimed at, if
never fully achieved: a situation giving rise to an event can never look the
same to the analyst as it did to the participant. A mass of minor
circumstances that may have influenced his decision are now lost to us, and
many subjective motives may never have been exposed at all. These can
only be discovered from the memoirs of the commanders, or from people
very close to them. Memoirs often treat such matters pretty broadly, or,
perhaps deliberately, with something less than candor. In short, the critic
will always lack much that was present in the mind of the commander.

knowledge. That is possible only with regard to accidental factors that
impinge on the situation without being basic to it; in all really essential
matters, however, it is very difficult and never fully attainable.

is almost impossible to prevent the knowledge of it from coloring one’s
judgment of the circumstances from which it arose: we see these things in
the light of their result, and to some extent come to know and appreciate
them fully only because of it. Military history in all its aspects is itself a
source of instruction for the critic, and it is only natural that he should look
at all particular events in the light of the whole. Therefore, even if in some
cases he did try to disregard results altogether, he could never entirely
succeed.

subsequently) but also of facts that were present from the beginning—the
factors that determine the action. The critic will, as a rule, have more
information than the participant. One would think he could easily ignore it,
but he cannot. This is because knowledge of previous and simultaneous
circumstances does not rest on specific information alone but on numerous
conjectures and assumptions. Completely accidental matters apart, very
little information does come to hand which has not been preceded by

assumptions or conjectures. If specifics do not materialize, these
assumptions and conjectures will take their place. Now we can understand
why later critics who know all the previous and attendant circumstances
must not be influenced by their knowledge when they ask which among the
unknown facts they themselves would have considered probable at the time
of the action. We maintain that complete insulation is as impossible here as
it is when we consider the final outcome, and for the same reasons.

Therefore, if a critic wishes to praise or blame any specific action, he will

only partly be able to put himself in the situation of the participant. In many
cases he can do this well enough to suit practical purposes, but we must not
forget that sometimes it is completely impossible.

It is, however, neither necessary nor desirable for the critic to identify

himself completely with the commander. In war, as in all skills, a trained
natural aptitude is called for. This virtuosity may be great or small. If it is
great, it may easily be superior to that of the critic: what student would lay
claim to the talent of a Frederick or a Bonaparte? Hence, unless we are to
hold our peace in deference to outstanding talent, we must be allowed to
profit from the wider horizons available to us. A critic should therefore not
check a great commander’s solution to a problem as if it were a sum in
arithmetic. Rather, he must recognize with admiration the commander’s
success, the smooth unfolding of events, the higher workings of his genius.
The essential interconnections that genius had divined, the critic has to
reduce to factual knowledge.

To judge even the slightest act of talent, it is necessary for the critic to

take a more comprehensive point of view, so that he, in possession of any
number of objective reasons, reduces subjectivity to the minimum, and so
avoids judging by his own, possibly limited, standards.

This elevated position of criticism, dispensing praise or blame with a full

knowledge of all the circumstances, will not insult our feelings. The critic
will do this only if he pushes himself into the limelight and implies that all
the wisdom that is in fact derived from his complete knowledge of the case
is due to his own abilities. No matter how crass that fraud, vanity may very
easily lead to it, and it will naturally give offense. More often the critic does
not mean to be arrogant; but, unless he makes a point of denying it, a hasty
reader will suspect him of it, and this will at once give rise to a charge of
lack of critical judgment.

does not mean that he would not have made them too. He may even admit
that in the situation of these generals he might have made far greater errors.
What it does mean is that he can recognize these mistakes from the pattern
of events and feels that the commander’s sagacity should have seen them as
well.

their outcome. But, in addition, the outcome may have a completely
different effect on judgment—when the outcome is simply used as proof
that an action was either correct or incorrect. This may be called a judgment
by results. At first sight such a judgment would seem entirely inadmissible,
but that is not the case.

When in 1812 Bonaparte advanced on Moscow the crucial question was

whether the capture of the capital, together with everything else that had
alreadv happened, would induce Czar Alexander to make peace. That had
happened in 1807 after the battle of Friedland, and it had also worked in
1805 and 1809 with the Emperor Francis after the battles of Austerlitz and
Wagram. If, however, peace was not made at Moscow, Bonaparte would
have no choice but to turn back, which would have meant a strategic defeat.
Let us leave aside the steps by which he advanced on Moscow, and the
question whether, in the process, he missed a number of opportunities that
might have made the Czar decide on peace. Let us also leave aside the
terrible circumstances of the retreat, which may have had their root in the
conduct of the entire campaign. The crucial question remains the same: no
matter how much more successful the advance on Moscow might have
been, it would still have been uncertain whether it could have frightened the
Czar into suing for peace. And even if the retreat had not led to the
annihilation of the army, it could never have been anything but a major
strategic defeat. If the Czar had concluded a disadvantageous peace, the
campaign of 1812 would have ranked with those of Austerlitz, Friedland,
and Wagram. But if these campaigns had not resulted in peace, they would
probably have led to similar catastrophes. Regardless of the power, skill,
and wisdom shown by the conqueror of the world, the final fatal question
remained everywhere the same. Should we then ignore the actual results of
the campaigns of 1805, 1807, and 1809, and, by the test of 1812 alone,
proclaim them to be products of imprudence, and their success to be a

breach of natural law? Should we maintain that in 1812 strategic justice
finally overcame blind chance? That would be a very forced conclusion, an
arbitrary judgment where half the evidence is missing, because the human
eye cannot trace the interconnection of events back to the decisions of the
vanquished monarchs.

succeeded like the others, and that its failure was due to something
extraneous: there was nothing extraneous about Alexander’s steadfastness.

What can be more natural than to say that in 1805, 1807, and 1809

Bonaparte had gauged his enemy correctly, while in 1812 he did not? In the
earlier instances he was right, in the latter he was wrong, and we can say
that because the outcome proves it.

rather than at certain success. The degree of certainty that is lacking must in
every case be left to fate, chance, or whatever you like to call it. One may of
course ask that this dependence should be as slight as possible, but only in
reference to a particular case—in other words, it should be as small as
possible in that individual case. But we should not habitually prefer the
course that involves the least uncertainty. That would be an enormous
mistake, as our theoretical arguments will show. There are times when the
utmost daring is the height of wisdom.

It would seem that a commander’s personal merits, and thus also his

responsibility, become irrelevant to all questions that have to be left to
chance. Nevertheless, we cannot deny an inner satisfaction whenever things
turn out right; when they do not, we feel a certain intellectual discomfort.
That is all the meaning that should be attached to a judgment of right and
wrong that we deduce from success, or rather that we find in success.

intellectual discomfort at failure arise from an obscure sense of some
delicate link, invisible to the mind’s eye, between success and the
commander’s genius. It is a gratifying assumption. The truth of this is
shown by the fact that our sympathy increases and grows keener as success
and failure are repeated by the same man. That is why luck in war is of
higher quality than luck in gambling. So long as a successful general has
not done us any harm, we follow his career with pleasure.

calculation and belief, will let the outcome speak for that part whose deep,
mysterious operation is never visible. The critic must protect this unspoken
result of the workings of higher laws against the stream of uninformed
opinion on the one hand, and against the gross abuses to which it may be
subjected on the other.

Success enables us to understand much that the workings of human

intelligence alone would not be able to discover. That means that it will be
useful mainly in revealing intellectual and psychological forces and effects,
because these are least subject to reliable evaluation, and also because they
are so closely involved with the will that they may easily control it.
Wherever decisions are based on fear or courage, they can no longer be
judged objectively; consequently, intelligence and calculation can no longer
be expected to determine the probable outcome.

We must now be allowed to make a few remarks about the instruments

critics use—their idiom; for in a sense it accompanies action in war. Critical
analysis, after all, is nothing but thinking that should precede the action. We
therefore consider it essential that the language of criticism should have the
same character as thinking must have in wars; otherwise it loses its practical
value and criticism would lose contact with its subject.

ought to train a commander’s mind, or rather, guide his education; theory is
not meant to provide him with positive doctrines and systems to be used as
intellectual tools. Moreover, if it is never necessary or even permissible to
use scientific guidelines in order to judge a given problem in war, if the
truth never appears in systematic form, if it is not acquired deductively but
always directly through the natural perception of the mind, then that is the
way it must also be in critical analysis.

facts of the situation, we must have recourse to the relevant principles
established by theory. But in the same way as in war these truths are better
served by a commander who has absorbed their meaning in his mind rather
than one who treats them as rigid external rules, so the critic should not
apply them like an external law or an algebraic formula whose relevance
need not be established each time it is used. These truths should always be
allowed to become self-evident, while only the more precise and complex

proofs are left to theory. We will thus avoid using an arcane and obscure
language, and express ourselves in plain speech, with a sequence of clear,
lucid concepts.

Granted that while this cannot always be completely achieved, it must

remain the aim of critical analysis. The complex forms of cognition should
be used as little as possible, and one should never use elaborate scientific
guidelines as if they were a kind of truth machine. Everything should be
done through the natural workings of the mind.

However, this pious aspiration, if we may call it that, has rarely prevailed

in critical studies; on the contrary, a kind of vanity has impelled most of
them to an ostentatious exhibition of ideas.

The first common error is an awkward and quite impermissible use of

certain narrow systems as formal bodies of laws. It is never difficult to
demonstrate the one-sidedness of such systems; and nothing more is needed
to discredit their authority once and for all. We are dealing here with a
limited problem, and since the number of possible systems is after all finite,
this error is the lesser of two evils that concern us.

metaphors that attends these systems. They swarm everywhere—a lawless
rabble of camp followers. Any critic who has not seen fit to adopt a system
— either because he has not found one that he likes or because he has not
yet got that far—will still apply an occasional scrap of one as if it were a
ruler, to show the crookedness of a commander’s course. Few of them can
proceed without the occasional support of such scraps of scientific military
theory. The most insignificant of them—mere technical expressions and
metaphors—are sometimes nothing more than ornamental flourishes of the
critical narrative. But it is inevitable that all the terminology and technical
expressions of a given system will lose what meaning they have, if any,
once they are torn from their context and used as general axioms or nuggets
of truth that are supposed to be more potent than a simple statement.

Thus it has come about that our theoretical and critical literature, instead

of giving plain, straightforward arguments in which the author at least
always knows what he is saying and the reader what he’ is reading, is
crammed with jargon, ending at obscure crossroads where the author loses
his readers. Sometimes these books are even worse: they are just hollow
shells. The author himself no longer knows just what he is thinking and

soothes himself with obscure ideas which would not satisfy him if
expressed in plain speech.

misuse of historical examples. We have already stated what the history of
the art of war is, and our views on historical examples and military history
in general will be developed in later chapters. A fact that is cited in passing
may be used to support the most contradictory views; and three or four
examples from distant times and places, dragged in and piled up from the
widest range of circumstances, tend to distract and confuse one’s judgment
without proving anything. The light of day usually reveals them to be mere
trash, with which the author intends to show off his learning.

arbitrary notions? Very little—so little that they have made theory, from its
beginnings, the very opposite of practice, and not infrequently the laughing
stock of men whose military competence is beyond dispute.

This could never have happened if by means of simple terms and

straightforward observation of the conduct of war theory had sought to
determine all that was determinable; if, without spurious claims, with no
unseemly display of scientific formulae and historical compendia, it had
stuck to the point and never parted company with those who have to
manage things in battle by the light of their native wit.

Historical examples are, however, seldom used to such good effect. On

the contrary, the use made of them by theorists normally not only leaves the
reader dissatisfied but even irritates his intelligence. We therefore consider
it important to focus attention on the proper and improper uses of examples.

Undoubtedly, the knowledge basic to the art of war is empirical. While,

for the most part, it is derived from the nature of things, this very nature is
usually revealed to us only by experience. Its application, moreover, is
modified by so many conditions that its effects can never be completely
established merely from the nature of the means.

The effects of gunpowder—that major agent of military activity—could

only be demonstrated by experience. Experiments are still being conducted
to study them more closely.

It is, of course, obvious that an iron cannonball, impelled by powder to a

speed of 1,000 feet per second, will smash any living creature in its path.
One needs no experience to believe that. But there are hundreds of relevant
details determining this effect, some of which can only be revealed
empirically. Nor is the physical effect the only thing that matters: the
psychological effect is what concerns us, and experience is the only means
by which it can be established and appreciated. In the Middle Ages firearms
were a new invention, so crude that their physical effect was much less

important than today; but their psychological impact was considerably
greater. One has to have seen the steadfastness of one of the forces trained
and led by Bonaparte in the course of his conquests—seen them under
fierce and unrelenting fire—to get some sense of what can be accomplished
by troops steeled by long experience of danger, in whom a proud record of
victories has instilled the noble principle of placing the highest demands on
themselves. As an idea alone it is unbelievable. On the other hand, there are
European armies that still have troops such as Tartars, Cossacks, and Croats
whose ranks can easily be scattered by a few rounds of artillery.

Still, the empirical sciences, the theory of the art of war included, cannot

always back their conclusions with historical proofs. The sheer range to be
covered would often rule this out; and, apart from that, it might be difficult
to point to actual experience on every detail. If, in warfare, a certain means
turns out to be highly effective, it will be used again; it will be copied by
others and become fashionable; and so, backed by experience, it passes into
general use and is included in theory. Theory is content to refer to
experience in general to indicate the origin of the method, but not to prove
it.

method in current usage, confirm a dubious, or introduce a new one. In
those cases, individual instances from history must be produced as
evidence.

A closer look at the use of historical examples will enable us to

distinguish four points of view.

idea. Abstract discussion, after all, is very easily misunderstood, or not
understood at all. When an author fears that this might happen, he may use
a historical example to throw the necessary light on his idea and to ensure
that the reader and the writer will remain in touch.

Second, it may serve to show the application of an idea. An example

gives one the opportunity of demonstrating the operation of all those minor
circumstances which could not be included in a general formulation of the
idea. Indeed, this is the difference between theory and experience. Both the
foregoing cases concerned true examples; the two that follow concern
historical proof.

suffice wherever one merely wants to prove the possibility of some
phenomenon or effect.

combination of several events, make it possible to deduce a doctrine: the
proof is in the evidence itself.

case, for only one aspect of it matters. Historical truth is not even essential
here: an imaginary case would do as well. Still, historical examples always
have the advantage of being more realistic and of bringing the idea they are
illustrating to life.

The second type of usage demands a more detailed presentation of

events; but authenticity, once again, is not essential. In this respect, we
repeat what we said about the first case.

an undisputed fact. If one is trying to show that an entrenched position can
under certain circumstances prove effective, a mention of the Bunzelwitz
position will support the statement.

If, however, some historical event is being presented in order to

demonstrate a general truth, care must be taken that every aspect bearing on
the truth at issue is fully and circumstantially developed—carefully
assembled, so to speak, before the reader’s eyes. To the extent that this
cannot be done, the proof is weakened, and the more necessary it will be to
use a number of cases to supply the evidence missing in that one. It is fair to
assume that where we cannot cite more precise details, the average effect
will be decided by a greater number of examples.

Suppose one wants to prove from experience that cavalry should be

placed in the rear of infantry rather than in line with it; or that, without
definite numerical superiority, it is extremely dangerous to use widely
separated columns in attempting to envelop the enemy, both on the
battlefield and in the theater of operations—tactically or strategically, in
other words. As to the first instance, it is not enough to cite a few defeats
where the cavalry was on the flanks, and a few victories where it was
behind the infantry; in the second case, it will not be enough to refer to the
battles of Rivoli or Wagram, and the Austrian attacks on the Italian theater,
or those of the French on the German theater of war, in 1796. Instead one

must accurately trace all the circumstances and individual events, to show
the way in which those types of position and attack definitely contributed to
the defeat. The result will show to what degree these types are
objectionable—a point that must be settled in any case, because a general
condemnation would conflict with the truth.

We have already agreed that where a detailed factual account cannot be

given, any lack of evidence may be made up by the number of examples;
but this is clearly a dangerous expedient, and is frequently misused. Instead
of presenting a fully detailed case, critics are content merely to touch on
three or four, which give the semblance of strong proof. But there are
occasions where nothing will be proved by a dozen examples—if, for
instance, they frequently recur and one could just as easily cite a dozen
cases that had opposite results. If anyone lists a dozen defeats in which the
losing side attacked with divided columns, I can list a dozen victories in
which that very tactic was employed. Obviously this is no way to reach a
conclusion.

Reflection upon these diverse circumstances will show how easily

examples may be misused.

is like an object seen at a great distance: it is impossible to distinguish any
detail, and it looks the same from every angle. Such examples have actually
been used to support the most conflicting views. Daun’s campaigns are, to
some, models of wisdom and foresight; to others, of timidity and
vacillation. Bonaparte’s thrust across the Norican Alps in 1797 strikes some
as a splendid piece of daring; others will call it completely reckless. His
strategic defeat in 1812 may be put down to an excess of energy, but also to
a lack of it. All these views have been expressed, and one can easily see
why: the pattern of events was interpreted in different ways. Nevertheless,
these conflicting opinions cannot coexist; one or the other must be wrong.

examples that adorn his memoirs. He not only records a number of events
that would otherwise have been forgotten; he was the first to make really
useful comparisons between abstract theoretical ideas and real life insofar
as the cases cited can be considered as explanations and closer definitions
of his theoretical assertions. Still, to an impartial modern reader, he has
hardly achieved the aim he usually set himself, that of proving theoretical

principles by historical examples. Though he occasionally records events in
some detail, he still falls short of proving that the conclusions he has drawn
are the inevitable consequences of their inherent patterns.

fact that some readers do not know enough about them, or do not remember
them well enough to grasp what the author has in mind. Such readers have
no choice but to be impressed by the argument, or to remain untouched by it
altogether.

It is hard of course to recount a historical event or reconstruct it for the

reader in the way required if it is to be used as evidence. The writer rarely
has the means, the space, or the time for that. We maintain, however, that
where a new or debatable point of view is concerned, a single thoroughly
detailed event is more instructive than ten that are only touched on. The
main objection to this superficial treatment is not that the writer pretends he
is trying to prove something but that he himself has never mastered the
events he cites, and that such superficial, irresponsible handling of history
leads to hundreds of wrong ideas and bogus theorizing. None of this would
come about if the writer’s duty were to show that the new ideas he is
presenting as guaranteed by history are indisputably derived from the
precise pattern of events.

come to the most obvious conclusion that examples should be drawn from
modern military history, insofar as it is properly known and evaluated.

ways of waging war, so that earlier wars have fewer practical lessons for us;
but military history, like any other kind, is bound with the passage of time
to lose a mass of minor elements and details that were once clear. It loses
some element of life and color, like a picture that gradually fades and
darkens. What remains in the end, more or less at random, are large masses
and isolated features, which are thereby given undue weight.

If we examine the conditions of modern warfare, we shall find that the

wars that bear a considerable resemblance to those of the present day,
especially with respect to armaments, are primarily campaigns beginning
with the War of the Austrian Succession. Even though many major and
minor circumstances have changed considerably, these are close enough to
modern warfare to be instructive. The situation is different with the War of

the Spanish Succession; the use of firearms was much less advanced, and
cavalry was still the most important arm. The further back one goes, the less
useful military history becomes, growing poorer and barer at the same time.
The history of antiquity is without doubt the most useless and the barest of
all.

This uselessness is of course not absolute; it refers only to matters that

depend on a precise knowledge of the actual circumstances, or on details in
which warfare has changed. Little as we may know about the battles the
Swiss fought against the Austrians, the Burgundians, and the French, it is
they that afford the first and strongest demonstration of the superiority of
good infantry against the best cavalry. A general glance at the age of the
Condottieri is enough to show that the conduct of war depends entirely on
the instrument employed; at no other time were the forces used so
specialized in character or so completely divorced from the rest of political
and civil life. The peculiar way in which Rome fought Carthage in the
Second Punic War—by attacking Spain and Africa while Hannibal was still
victorious in Italy—can provide a most instructive lesson: we still know
enough about the general situation of the states and armies that enabled
such a roundabout method of resistance to succeed.

one is able to select examples and experiences from remote times. We are in
no position to evaluate the relevant events correctly, nor to apply them to
the wholly different means we use today.

events in ancient history. How much of this is due to vanity and quackery
can remain unanswered; but one rarely finds any honesty of purpose, any
earnest attempt to instruct or convince. Such allusions must therefore be
looked upon as sheer decoration, designed to cover gaps and blemishes.

Feuquières tried to do, would be an achievement of the utmost value; but it
would be more than the work of a lifetime: anyone who set out to do it
would first have to equip himself with a thorough personal experience of
war.

Anyone who feels the urge to undertake such a task must dedicate

himself for his labors as he would prepare for a pilgrimage to distant lands.
He must spare no time or effort, fear no earthly power or rank, and rise

above his own vanity or false modesty in order to tell, in accordance with
the expression of the Code Napoleón, the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth.

BOOK THREE

Strategy is the use of the engagement for the purpose of the war. The

strategist must therefore define an aim for the entire operational side of the
war that will be in accordance with its purpose. In other words, he will draft
the plan of the war, and the aim will determine the series of actions intended
to achieve it: he will, in fact, shape the individual campaigns and, within
these, decide on the individual engagements. Since most of these matters
have to be based on assumptions that may not prove correct, while other,
more detailed orders cannot be determined in advance at all, it follows that
the strategist must go on campaign himself. Detailed orders can then be
given on the spot, allowing the general plan to be adjusted to the
modifications that are continuously required. The strategist, in short, must
maintain control throughout.

This has not always been the accepted view, at least so far as the general

principle is concerned. It used to be the custom to settle strategy in the
capital, and not in the field—a practice that is acceptable only if the
government stays so close to the army as to function as general
headquarters.

Strategic theory, therefore, deals with planning; or rather, it attempts to

shed light on the components of war and their interrelationships, stressing

those few principles or rules that can be demonstrated.

The reader who recalls from the first chapter of Book I how many vitally

important matters are involved in war will understand what unusual mental
gifts are needed to keep the whole picture steadily in mind.

campaign exactly to suit his objectives and his resources, doing neither too
much nor too little. But the effects of genius show not so much in novel
forms of action as in the ultimate success of the whole. What we should
admire is the accurate fulfillment of the unspoken assumptions, the smooth
harmony of the whole activity, which only become evident in final success.

final success may be tempted to look for genius in places where it does not
and cannot exist.

In fact, the means and forms that the strategist employs are so very

simple, so familiar from constant repetition, that it seems ridiculous in the
light of common sense when critics discuss them, as they do so often, with
ponderous solemnity. Thus, such a commonplace maneuver as turning an
opponent’s flank may be hailed by critics as a stroke of genius, of deepest
insight, or even of all-inclusive knowledge. Can one imagine anything more
absurd?

It is even more ridiculous when we consider that these very critics

usually exclude all moral qualities from strategic theory, and only examine
material factors. They reduce everything to a few mathematical formulas of
equilibrium and superiority, of time and space, limited by a few angles and
lines. If that were really all, it would hardly provide a scientific problem for
a schoolboy.

discussion. The relations between material factors are all very simple; what
is more difficult to grasp are the intellectual factors involved. Even so, it is
only in the highest realms of strategy that intellectual complications and
extreme diversity of factors and relationships occur. At that level there is
little or no difference between strategy, policy and statesmanship, and there,
as we have already said, their influence is greater in questions of quantity
and scale than in forms of execution. Where execution is dominant, as it is
in the individual events of a war whether great or small, then intellectual
factors are reduced to a minimum.

everything is very easy. Once it has been determined, from the political
conditions, what a war is meant to achieve and what it can achieve, it is
easy to chart the course. But great strength of character, as well as great
lucidity and firmness of mind, is required in order to follow through
steadily, to carry out the plan, and not to be thrown off course by thousands
of diversions. Take any number of outstanding men, some noted for
intellect, others for their acumen, still others for boldness or tenacity of
will: not one may possess the combination of qualities needed to make him
a greater than average commander.

will agree that it takes more strength of will to make an important decision
in strategy than in tactics. In the latter, one is carried away by the pressures
of the moment, caught up in a maelstrom where resistance would be fatal,
and, suppressing incipient scruples, one presses boldly on. In strategy, the
pace is much slower. There is ample room for apprehensions, one’s own
and those of others; for objections and remonstrations and, in consequence,
for premature regrets. In a tactical situation one is able to see at least half
the problem with the naked eye, whereas in strategy everything has to be
guessed at and presumed. Conviction is therefore weaker. Consequently
most generals, when they ought to act, are paralyzed by unnecessary
doubts.

Great fought in 1760, famous for its dazzling marches and maneuvers,
praised by critics as a work of art—indeed a masterpiece. Are we to be
beside ourselves with admiration at the fact that the King wanted first to
turn Daun’s right flank, then his left, then his right again, and so forth? Are
we to consider this profound wisdom? Certainly not, if we are to judge
without affectation. What is really admirable is the King’s wisdom:
pursuing a major objective with limited resources, he did not try to
undertake anything beyond his strength, but always just enough to get him
what he wanted. This campaign was not the only one in which he
demonstrated his judgment as a general. It is evident in all the three wars
fought by the great King.

His object was to bring Silesia into the safe harbor of a fully guaranteed

peace.

distinguished from them only by the efficiency of some branches of its
administration, Frederick could not be an Alexander. Had he acted like
Charles XII, he too would have ended in disaster. His whole conduct of war,
therefore, shows an element of restrained strength, which was always in
balance, never lacking in vigor, rising to remarkable heights in moments of
crisis, but immediately afterward reverting to a state of calm oscillation,
always ready to adjust to the smallest shift in the political situation. Neither
vanity, ambition, nor vindictiveness could move him from this course; and
it was this course alone that brought him success.

great general! One only has to examine carefully the causes and the
miraculous outcome of this struggle to realize that it was only the King’s
acute intelligence that led him safely through all hazards.

the campaign of 1760. At no other time was he able to hold off such a
superior enemy at so little cost.

Maneuvers designed to turn a flank are easily planned. It is equally easy to
conceive a plan for keeping a small force concentrated so that it can meet a
scattered enemy on equal terms at any point, and to multiply its strength by
rapid movement. There is nothing admirable about the ideas themselves.
Faced with such simple concepts, we have to admit that they are simple.

still wrote about the risk, indeed the imprudence, of the King’s positions;
and there can be no doubt that the danger appeared three times as
threatening at the time as afterward.

under the very guns, of the enemy. Frederick chose these positions and
made these marches, confident in the knowledge that Daun’s methods, his
dispositions, his sense of responsibility and his character would make such
maneuvers risky but not reckless. But it required the King’s boldness,
resolution, and strength of will to see things in this way, and not to be
confused and intimidated by the danger that was still being talked and
written about thirty years later. Few generals in such a situation would have
believed such simple means of strategy to be feasible.

campaign the King’s army was constantly on the move. Twice, in early July
and early August, it followed Daun while itself pursued by Lacy, from the
Elbe into Silesia over wretched country roads. The army had to be ready for
battle at any time, and its marches had to be organized with a degree of
ingenuity that required a proportionate amount of exertion. Though the
army was accompanied, and delayed, by thousands of wagons, it was
always short of supplies. For a week before the battle of Liegnitz in Silesia,
the troops marched day and night, alternatively deploying and withdrawing
along the enemy’s front. This cost enormous exertions and great hardship.

friction? Is a general, by sheer force of intellect, able to produce such
mobility with the ease of a surveyor manipulating an astrolabe? Are the
generals and the supreme commander not moved by the sight of the misery
suffered by their pitiful, hungry, and thirsty comrades in arms? Are
complaints and misgivings about such conditions not reported to the high
command? Would an ordinary man dare to ask for such sacrifices, and
would these not automatically lower the morale of the troops, corrupt their
discipline, in short undermine their fighting spirit unless an overwhelming
belief in the greatness and infallibility of their commander outweighed all
other considerations? It is this which commands our respect; it is these
miracles of execution that we have to admire. But to appreciate all this in
full measure one has to have had a taste of it through actual experience.
Those who know war only from books or the parade-ground cannot
recognize the existence of these impediments to action, and so we must ask
them to accept on faith what they lack in experience.

focus. In conclusion, we would point out that in our exposition of strategy
we shall describe those material and intellectual factors that seem to us to
be the most significant. We shall proceed from the simple to the complex,
and conclude with the unifying structure of the entire military activity—that
is, with the plan of campaign.

engagement possible; it does not necessarily take place. Should one treat
this possibility as a reality, as an actual occurrence? Certainly. It becomes
real because of its consequences, and consequences of some kind will
always follow.

POSSIBLE ENGAGEMENTS ARE TO BE REGARDED AS

REAL ONES BECAUSE OF THEIR CONSEQUENCES

If part of our army occupies an undefended enemy province and thus

denies the enemy substantial increments to his strength, the factor making it
possible for our force to hold the province is the engagement that the enemy
must expect to fight if he endeavors to retake it.

In both cases results have been produced by the mere possibility of an

engagement; the possibility has acquired reality. But let us suppose that in
each case the enemy had brought superior forces against our troops, causing
them to abandon their goal without fighting. This would mean that we had
fallen short of our objective; but still the engagement that we offered the
enemy was not without effect—it did draw off his forces. Even if the whole
enterprise leaves us worse off than before, we cannot say that no effects
resulted from using troops in this way, by producing the possibility of an
engagement; the effects were similar to those of a lost engagement.

This shows that the destruction of the enemy’s forces and the overthrow

of the enemy’s power can be accomplished only as the result of an
engagement, no matter whether it really took place or was merely offered
but not accepted.

EXAMPLES

We have pursued this argument to show that this is the natural and only

sound view to take, and this is what makes it important. We are constantly
brought back to the question: what, at any given stage of the war or
campaign, will be the likely outcome of all the major and minor
engagements that the two sides can offer one another? In the planning of a
campaign or a war, this alone will decide the measures that have to be taken
from the outset.

IF THIS VIEW IS NOT ADOPTED, OTHER MATTERS

WILL BE INACCURATELY ASSESSED

By looking on each engagement as part of a series, at least insofar as

events are predictable, the commander is always on the high road to his
goal. The forces gather momentum, and intentions and actions develop with
a vigor that is commensurate with the occasion, and impervious to outside
influences.

The first type covers everything that is created by intellectual and

psychological qualities and influences; the second consists of the size of the
armed forces, their composition, armament and so forth; the third includes
the angle of lines of operation, the convergent and divergent movements
wherever geometry enters into their calculation; the fourth comprises the
influence of terrain, such as commanding positions, mountains, rivers,
woods, and roads; and, finally, the fifth covers support and maintenance. A
brief consideration of each of these various types will clarify our ideas and,
in passing, assess the relative value of each. Indeed if they are studied
separately some will automatically be stripped of any undue importance.
For instance, it immediately becomes clear that the value of the base of
operations, even if we take this in its simplest form as meaning a base-line,
depends less on its geometric forms than on the nature of the roads and
terrain through which they run.

It would however be disastrous to try to develop our understanding of

strategy by analyzing these factors in isolation, since they are usually
interconnected in each military action in manifold and intricate ways. A
dreary analytical labyrinth would result, a nightmare in which one tried in
vain to bridge the gulf between this abstract basis and the facts of life.
Heaven protect the theorist from such an undertaking! For our part, we shall
continue to examine the picture as a whole, and take our analysis no further
than is necessary in each case to elucidate the idea we wish to convey,
which will always have its origins in the impressions made by the sum total
of the phenomena of war, rather than in speculative study.

The spirit and other moral qualities of an army, a general or a

government, the temper of the population of the theater of war, the moral
effects of victory or defeat—all these vary greatly. They can moreover
influence our objective and situation in very different ways.

Consequently, though next to nothing can be said about these things in

books, they can no more be omitted from the theory of the art of war than
can any of the other components of war. To repeat, it is paltry philosophy if
in the old-fashioned way one lays down rules and principles in total
disregard of moral values. As soon as these appear one regards them as
exceptions, which gives them a certain scientific status, and thus makes
them into rules. Or again one may appeal to genius, which is above all
rules; which amounts to admitting that rules are not only made for idiots,
but are idiotic in themselves.

If the theory of war did no more than remind us of these elements,

demonstrating the need to reckon with and give full value to moral
qualities, it would expand its horizon, and simply by establishing this point
of view would condemn in advance anyone who sought to base an analysis
on material factors alone.

Another reason for not placing moral factors beyond the scope of theory

is their relation to all other so-called rules. The effects of physical and
psychological factors form an organic whole which, unlike a metal alloy, is

inseparable by chemical processes. In formulating any rule concerning
physical factors, the theorist must bear in mind the part that moral factors
may play in it; otherwise he may be misled into making categorical
statements that will be too timid and restricted, or else too sweeping and
dogmatic. Even the most uninspired theories have involuntarily had to stray
into the area of intangibles; for instance, one cannot explain the effects of a
victory without taking psychological reactions into account. Hence most of
the matters dealt with in this book are composed in equal parts of physical
and of moral causes and effects. One might say that the physical seem little
more than the wooden hilt, while the moral factors are the precious metal,
the real weapon, the finely-honed blade.

and their often incredible effect: this is the noblest and most solid
nourishment that the mind of a general may draw from a study of the past.
Parenthetically, it should be noted that the seeds of wisdom that are to bear
fruit in the intellect are sown less by critical studies and learned
monographs than by insights, broad impressions, and flashes of intuition.

We might list the most important moral phenomena in war and, like a

diligent professor, try to evaluate them one by one. This method, however,
all too easily leads to platitudes, while the genuine spirit of inquiry soon
evaporates, and unwittingly we find ourselves proclaiming what everybody
already knows. For this reason we prefer, here even more than elsewhere, to
treat the subject in an incomplete and impressionistic manner, content to
have pointed out its general importance and to have indicated the spirit in
which the argument of this book are conceived.

Nevertheless it is true that at this time the armies of practically all

European states have reached a common level of discipline and training. To
use a philosophic expression: the conduct of war has developed in
accordance with its natural laws. It has evolved methods that are common
to most armies, and that no longer even allow the commander scope to
employ special artifices (in the sense, for example, of Frederick the Great’s
oblique order of battle). It cannot be denied, therefore, that as things stand
at present proportionately greater scope is given to the troops’ patriotic
spirit and combat experience. A long period of peace may change this
again.

The troops’ national feeling (enthusiasm, fanatical zeal, faith, and general

temper) is most apparent in mountain warfare where every man, down to
the individual soldier, is on his own. For this reason alone mountainous
areas constitute the terrain best suited for action by an armed populace.

Efficiency, skill, and the tempered courage that welds the body of troops

into a single mold will have their greatest scope in operations in open
country.

The commander’s talents are given greatest scope in rough hilly country.

Mountains allow him too little real command over his scattered units and he
is unable to control them all; in open country, control is a simple matter and
does not test his ability to the fullest.

These obvious affinities should guide our planning.

War is a special activity, different and separate from any other pursued by

man. This would still be true no matter how wide its scope, and though
every able-bodied man in the nation were under arms. An army’s military
qualities are based on the individual who is steeped in the spirit and essence
of this activity; who trains the capacities it demands, rouses them, and
makes them his own; who applies his intelligence to every detail; who gains
ease and confidence through practice, and who completely immerses his
personality in the appointed task.

No matter how clearly we see the citizen and the soldier in the same man,

how strongly we conceive of war as the business of the entire nation,
opposed diametrically to the pattern set by the condottieri of former times,
the business of war will always remain individual and distinct.
Consequently for as long as they practice this activity, soldiers will think of
themselves as members of a kind of guild, in whose regulations, laws, and
customs the spirit of war is given pride of place. And that does seem to be
the case. No matter how much one may be inclined to take the most
sophisticated view of war, it would be a serious mistake to underrate
professional pride (esprit de corps) as something that may and must be
present in an army to greater or lesser degree. Professional pride is the bond

between the various natural forces that activate the military virtues; in the
context of this professional pride they crystallize more readily.

cannot be shaken by imaginary fears and resists well-founded ones with all
its might; that, proud of its victories, will not lose the strength to obey
orders and its respect and trust for its officers even in defeat; whose
physical power, like the muscles of an athlete, has been steeled by training
in privation and effort; a force that regards such efforts as a means to
victory rather than a curse on its cause; that is mindful of all these duties
and qualities by virtue of the single powerful idea of the honor of its arms—
such an army is imbued with the true military spirit.

It is possible to fight superbly, like the men of the Vendée, and to achieve

great results, like the Swiss, the Americans, and the Spaniards without
developing the kind of virtues discussed here; it is even possible to be the
victorious commander of a regular army, like Prince Eugene and
Marlborough, without drawing substantially on their help. No one can
maintain that it is impossible to fight a successful war without these
qualities. We stress this to clarify the concept, and not lose sight of the idea
in a fog of generalities and give the impression that military spirit is all that
counts in the end. That is not the case. The spirit of an army may be
envisaged as a definite moral factor that can be mentally subtracted, whose
influence may therefore be estimated—in other words, it is a tool whose
power is measurable.

and the various ways of developing it.

as does a general’s ability to the whole. The general can command only the
overall situation and not the separate parts. At the point where the separate
parts need guidance, the military spirit must take command. Generals are
chosen for their outstanding qualities, and other high-ranking officers are
carefully tested; but the testing process becomes less thorough the further
we descend on the scale of command, and we must be prepared for a
proportionate diminution of personal talent. What is missing here must be
made up by military virtues. The same role is played by the natural qualities
of a people mobilized for war: bravery, adaptability, stamina, and

enthusiasm. These, then, are the qualities that can act as substitutes for the
military spirit and vice-versa, leading us to the following conclusions:

1. Military virtues are found only in regular armies, and they are the ones

that need them most. In national uprisings and peoples’ wars their
place is taken by natural warlike qualities, which develop faster under
such conditions.

2. A regular army fighting another regular army can get along without

military virtues more easily than when it is opposed by a people in
arms; for in the latter case, the forces have to be split up, and the
separate units will more frequently have to fend for themselves. Where
the troops can remain concentrated, however, the talents of the
commander are given greater scope, and can make up for any lack of
spirit among the troops. Generally speaking, the need for military
virtues becomes greater the more the theater of operations and other
factors tend to complicate the war and disperse the forces.

 
If there is a lesson to be drawn from these facts, it is that when an army

lacks military virtues, every effort should be made to keep operations as
simple as possible, or else twice as much attention should be paid to other
aspects of the military system. The mere fact that soldiers belong to a
“regular army” does not automatically mean they are equal to their tasks.

Military spirit, then, is one of the most important moral elements in war.

Where this element is absent, it must either be replaced by one of the
others, such as the commander’s superior ability or popular enthusiasm, or
else the results will fall short of the efforts expended. How much has been
accomplished by this spirit, this sterling quality, this refinement of base ore
into precious metal, is demonstrated by the Macedonians under Alexander,
the Roman legions under Caesar, the Spanish infantry under Alexander
Farnese, the Swedes under Gustavus Adolphus and Charles XII, the
Prussians under Frederick the Great, and the French under Bonaparte. One
would have to be blind to all the evidence of history if one refused to admit
that the outstanding successes of these commanders and their greatness in
adversity were feasible only with the aid of an army possessing these
virtues.

to create it. The first is a series of victorious wars; the second, frequent
exertions of the army to the utmost limits of its strength. Nothing else will
show a soldier the full extent of his capacities. The more a general is
accustomed to place heavy demands on his soldiers, the more he can
depend on their response. A soldier is just as proud of the hardships he has
overcome as of the dangers he has faced. In short, the seed will grow only
in the soil of constant activity and exertion, warmed by the sun of victory.
Once it has grown into a strong tree, it will survive the wildest storms of
misfortune and defeat, and even the indolent inertia of peace, at least for a
while. Thus, this spirit can be created only in war and by great generals,
though admittedly it may endure, for several generations at least, even
under generals of average ability and through long periods of peace.

One should be careful not to compare this expanded and refined

solidarity of a brotherhood of tempered, battle-scarred veterans with the
self-esteem and vanity of regular armies which are patched together only by
service-regulations and drill. Grim severity and iron discipline may be able
to preserve the military virtues of a unit, but it cannot create them. These
factors are valuable, but they should not be overrated. Discipline, skill,
goodwill, a certain pride, and high morale, are the attributes of an army
trained in times of peace. They command respect, but they have no strength
of their own. They stand or fall together. One crack, and the whole thing
goes, like a glass too quickly cooled. Even the highest morale in the world
can, at the first upset, change all too easily into despondency, an almost
boastful fear; the French would call it sauve qui peut. An army like this will
be able to prevail only by virtue of its commander, never on its own. It must
be led with more than normal caution until, after a series of victories and
exertions, its inner strength will grow to fill its external panoply. We should
take care never to confuse the real spirit of an army with its mood.

But this noble capacity to rise above the most menacing dangers should

also be considered as a principle in itself, separate and active. Indeed, in
what field of human activity is boldness more at home than in war?

A soldier, whether drummer boy or general, can possess no nobler

quality; it is the very metal that gives edge and luster to the sword.

be granted a certain power over and above successful calculations involving
space, time, and magnitude of forces, for wherever it is superior, it will take
advantage of its opponent’s weakness. In other words, it is a genuinely
creative force. This fact is not difficult to prove even scientifically.
Whenever boldness encounters timidity, it is likely to be the winner,
because timidity in itself implies a loss of equilibrium. Boldness will be at a
disadvantage only in an encounter with deliberate caution, which may be
considered bold in its own right, and is certainly just as powerful and
effective; but such cases are rare. Timidity is the root of prudence in the
majority of men.

In most soldiers, the development of boldness can never be detrimental to

other qualities, because the rank and file is bound by duty and the
conditions of the service to a higher authority, and thus is led by external
intelligence. With them boldness acts like a coiled spring, ready at any time
to be released.

The higher up the chain of command, the greater is the need for boldness

to be supported by a reflective mind, so that boldness does not degenerate
into purposeless bursts of blind passion. Command becomes progressively

less a matter of personal sacrifice and increasingly concerned for the safety
of others and for the common purpose. The quality that in most soldiers is
disciplined by service regulations that have become second nature to them,
must in the commanding officer be disciplined by reflection. In a
commander a bold act may prove to be a blunder. Nevertheless, it is a
laudable error, not to be regarded on the same footing as others. Happy the
army where ill-timed boldness occurs frequently; it is a luxuriant weed, but
indicates the richness of the soil. Even foolhardiness—that is, boldness
without any object—is not to be despised: basically it stems from daring,
which in this case has erupted with a passion unrestrained by thought. Only
when boldness rebels against obedience, when it defiantly ignores an
expressed command, must it be treated as a dangerous offense; then it must
be prevented, not for its innate qualities, but because an order has been
disobeyed, and in war obedience is of cardinal importance.

Given the same amount of intelligence, timidity will do a thousand times

more damage in war than audacity. The truth of this observation will be
self-evident to our readers.

In fact, the supervention of a rational purpose ought to make it easier to

be bold, and therefore less meritorious. Yet the opposite is true.

of lucid thought and, more, by self control. Consequently, boldness grows
less common in the higher ranks. Even if the growth of an officer’s
perception and intelligence does not keep pace with his rise in rank, the
realities of war will impose their conditions and concerns on him. Indeed
their influence on him will be greater the less he really understands them. In
war, this is the main basis for the experience expressed in the French
proverb, “Tel brille au second qui s’eclipse au premier.”87 Nearly every
general known to us from history as mediocre, even vacillating, was noted
for dash and determination as a junior officer.

A distinction should be made among acts of boldness that result from

sheer necessity. Necessity comes in varying degrees. If it is pressing, a man
in pursuit of his aim may be driven to incur one set of risks in order to avoid
others just as serious. In that event one can admire only his powers of
resolution, which, however, are also of value. The young man who leaps
across a deep chasm to show off his horsemanship displays boldness; if he

takes the same leap to escape a band of savage janissaries all he shows is
resolution. The greater the distance between necessity and action, the more
numerous the possibilities that have to be identified and analyzed before
action is taken, the less is the factor of boldness reduced. When Frederick
the Great perceived in 1756 that war was unavoidable and that he was lost
unless he could forestall his enemies, it became a necessity for him to
initiate hostilities; but at the same time it was an act of boldness, because
few men in his position would have dared to act in this way.

officers, boldness in the rest of the army is as important a factor in planning
as any other military virtue. More can be achieved with an army drawn
from people known for their boldness, an army in which a daring spirit has
always been nurtured, than with an army that lacks this quality. For that
reason, boldness in general has been mentioned here, even though our
actual subject is the boldness of the commander. After having given a broad
description of this military virtue, however, there is not much left to say.
The higher the military rank, the greater is the degree to which activity is
governed by the mind, by the intellect, by insight. Consequently boldness,
which is a quality of temperament, will tend to be held in check. This
explains why it is so rare in the higher ranks, and why it is all the more
admirable when found there. Boldness governed by superior intellect is the
mark of a hero. This kind of boldness does not consist in defying the natural
order of things and in crudely offending the laws of probability; it is rather a
matter of energetically supporting that higher form of analysis by which
genius arrives at a decision: rapid, only partly conscious weighing of the
possibilities. Boldness can lend wings to intellect and insight; the stronger
the wings then, the greater the heights, the wider the view, and the better the
results; though a greater prize, of course, involves greater risks. The
average man, not to speak of a hesitant or weak one, may in an imaginary
situation, in the peace of his room far removed from danger and
responsibility, arrive at the right answer—that is, insofar as this is possible
without exposure to reality. But beset on every side with danger and
responsibility he will lose perspective. Even if this is provided by others, he
will lose his powers of decision, for here no one else can help him.

In other words a distinguished commander without boldness is

unthinkable. No man who is not born bold can play such a role, and

therefore we consider this quality the first prerequisite of the great military
leader. How much of this quality remains by the time he reaches senior
rank, after training and experience have affected and modified it, is another
question. The greater the extent to which it is retained, the greater the range
of his genius. The magnitude of the risks increases, but so does that of the
goal. To the critical student there is not much difference between actions
governed bv some compelling long-range aim and those that are dictated by
pure ambition—between the policies of a Frederick and an Alexander. The
actions of the latter may fascinate the imagination because of their supreme
boldness, while those of the former may be more satisfying to the intellect
because they are dictated by an inner necessity.

We must mention one more factor of importance.
An army may be imbued with boldness for two reasons: it may come

naturally to the people from which the troops are recruited, or it may be the
result of a victorious war fought under bold leadership. If the latter is the
case, boldness will at the outset be lacking.

spirit of boldness; and it has to be a war waged under daring leadership.
Nothing else will counteract the softness and the desire for ease which
debase the people in times of growing prosperity and increasing trade.

national character and familiarity with war fortify each other by continual

In war more than anywhere else things do not turn out as we expect.

Nearby they do not appear as they did from a distance. With what assurance
an architect watches the progress of his work and sees his plans gradually
take shape! A doctor, though much more exposed to chance and to
inexplicable results, knows his medicines and the effects they produce. By
contrast, a general in time of war is constantly bombarded by reports both
true and false; by errors arising from fear or negligence or hastiness; by
disobedience born of right or wrong interpretations, of ill will, of a proper
or mistaken sense of duty, of laziness, or of exhaustion; and by accidents
that nobody could have foreseen. In short, he is exposed to countless
impressions, most of them disturbing, few of them encouraging. Long
experience of war creates a knack of rapidly assessing these phenomena;
courage and strength of character are as impervious to them as a rock to the
rippling waves. If a man were to yield to these pressures, he would never
complete an operation. Perseverance in the chosen course is the essential
counterweight, provided that no compelling reasons intervene to the
contrary. Moreover, there is hardly a worthwhile enterprise in war whose
execution does not call for infinite effort, trouble, and privation; and as man
under pressure tends to give in to physical and intellectual weakness, only
great strength of will can lead to the objective. It is steadfastness that will
earn the admiration of the world and of posterity.

Strategy decides the time when, the place where, and the forces with

which the engagement is to be fought, and through this threefold activity
exerts considerable influence on its outcome. Once the tactical encounter
has taken place and the result—be it victory or defeat—is assured, strategy
will use it to serve the object of the war. This object of course is usually
remote, and only rarely lies very near at hand. A series of secondary
objectives may serve as means to the attainment of the ultimate goal; these
intermediate ends, which are means to higher ends, may in practice be of
various types. Even the ultimate object, the purpose of the entire war,
differs in almost every case. We shall become better acquainted with these
matters as we go into the various details that they affect. We do not propose
here to enumerate them completely, even if this were possible. For the time
being, therefore, we will not discuss the use of the engagement.

Nor are the factors by which strategy influences the outcome of the

engagement simple enough to be dealt with in a single statement. In
determining the time and place of the engagement, and the forces to be
used, strategy poses numerous possibilities, each of which will have a
different effect on the outcome of the engagement. Here again we shall
become acquainted with the subject gradually as we study the various
factors that bear on it.

If we thus strip the engagement of all the variables arising from its

purpose and circumstances, and disregard the fighting value of the troops
involved (which is a given quantity), we are left with the bare concept of
the engagement, a shapeless battle in which the only distinguishing factor is
the number of troops on either side.

from the mass of abstractions I have made to reach this point that
superiority of numbers in a given engagement is only one of the factors that
determines victory. Superior numbers, far from contributing everything, or
even a substantial part, to victory, may actually be contributing very little,
depending on the circumstances.

But superiority varies in degree. It can be two to one, or three or four to

one, and so on; it can obviously reach the point where it is overwhelming.

factor in the outcome of an engagement, so long as it is great enough to
counterbalance all other contributing circumstances. It thus follows that as
many troops as possible should be brought into the engagement at the
decisive point.

everything in our power. This is the first principle of strategy. In the general
terms in which it is expressed here it would hold true for Greeks and
Persians, for Englishmen and Mahrattas, for Frenchmen and Germans. But
in order to be more concrete, let us examine the military conditions in
Europe.

European armies are comparable in equipment, organization, and

training. Such differences as may exist are to be found in the spirit of the
troops and the ability of the commander. If we look at recent European
history, we shall not find another Marathon.

Austrians; at Rossbach he defeated 50,000 allies with 25,000 men. These
however are the only examples of victories won over an opponent two or
even nearly three times as strong. Charles XII at the battle of Narva is not in
the same category. The Russians at that time could hardly be considered as
Europeans; moreover, we know too little about the main features of that
battle. Bonaparte commanded 120,000 men at Dresden against 220,000—
not quite half. At Kolin, Frederick the Great’s 30,000 men could not defeat
50,000 Austrians; similarly, victory eluded Bonaparte at the desperate battle
of Leipzig, though with his 160,000 men against 280,000, his opponent was
far from being twice as strong.

These examples may show that in modern Europe even the most talented

general will find it very difficult to defeat an opponent twice his strength.

When we observe that the skill of the greatest commanders may be
counterbalanced by a two-to-one ratio in the fighting forces, we cannot
doubt that in ordinary cases, whether the engagement be great or small, a
significant superiority in numbers (it does not have to be more than double)
will suffice to assure victory, however adverse the other circumstances. It is
possible, of course, to imagine a mountain pass where even a tenfold
superiority would not be sufficient, but in such a situation we cannot really
speak of an engagement.

factor is the possession of strength at the really vital point. Usually it is
actually the most important factor. To achieve strength at the decisive point
depends on the strength of the army and on the skill with which this
strength is employed.

The first rule, therefore, should be: put the largest possible army into the

field. This may sound a platitude, but in reality it is not.

major significance, we need only point out that most of the military
histories of the eighteenth century—even the most extensive ones—either
do not mention the size of armies, or do so only in a very casual way;
certainly they never emphasize it. Tempelhoff, in his history of the Seven
Years War, is the first author to give figures regularly, though they are only
approximations.

1793-1794, with its frequently critical observations, has much to say about
hills and valleys, roads and tracks, but not a syllable about the strength of
the opposing forces.

Further proof is found in the strange ideas that haunted some authors:

that there is a certain optimum size for an army; an ideal norm, and that any
troops in excess of it are more trouble than they are worth.88

Finally there are many cases in which not all forces available were

actually used in a battle or war, because numerical superiority was not given
its due importance.

If one is genuinely convinced that a great deal can be achieved by

significant superiority, this conviction is bound to influence the preparations
for war. The aim will then be to take the field in the greatest possible

marks the start of military activity—it is indeed a vital part of strategy—and
the general who is to command the army in the field usually has to accept
the size of his forces as a given factor. Either he was not consulted in the
matter, or circumstances may have prevented the raising of a sufficiently
large force.

even in the absence of absolute superiority, relative superiority is attained at
the decisive point.

essential factor, and this has given rise to the belief that in strategy space
and time cover practically everything concerning the use of the forces.
Indeed, some have gone so far as to ascribe to great generals a special organ
to deal with strategy and tactics.

else and is, so to speak, the daily bread of strategy, it is neither the most
difficult nor the decisive factor.

the strategic plane there have been very few cases where errors in such a
calculation led to serious defeat. Moreover, if the concept of a skillful
correlation of time and space is to explain every instance in which a
determined and enterprising general was able, by means of rapid marches,
to beat several forces with a single army (Frederick the Great, Bonaparte),
we would confuse ourselves unnecessarily by conventional jargon. If
concepts are to be clear and fruitful, things must be called by their right
names.

opposing generals (Daun, Schwarzenberg), willingness to risk facing them
for a time with inferior forces, energy for rapid movement, boldness for
quick attacks, and the increased activity which danger generates in great
men. What does this have to do with the ability to calculate the relationship
of two such simple elements as time and space?

entrusted their defense, by which the victories of Rossbach and Montmirail
gave impetus to those of Leuthen and Montereau, is, if we wish to be clear
and accurate, rare in history.

Relative superiority, that is, the skillful concentration of superior strength

at the decisive point, is much more frequently based on the correct appraisal
of this decisive point, on suitable planning from the start; which leads to
appropriate disposition of the forces, and on the resolution needed to
sacrifice nonessentials for the sake of essentials—that is, the courage to
retain the major part of one’s forces united. This is particularly
characteristic of Frederick the Great and Bonaparte.

With this discussion, we believe we have shown how significant

superiority of numbers really is. It must be regarded as fundamental—to be
achieved in every case and to the fullest possible extent.

numerical superiority as indispensable to victory; we merely wished to
stress the relative importance. The principle is served if we use the largest
possible force; the question whether to avoid a fight for lack of strength can
be decided only in the light of all other circumstances.

Surprise therefore becomes the means to gain superiority, but because of

its psychological effect it should also be considered as an independent
element. Whenever it is achieved on a grand scale, it confuses the enemy
and lowers his morale; many examples, great and small, show how this in
turn multiplies the results. We are not speaking here of a surprise assault,
which falls under the general category of “attack,” but of the desire to
surprise the enemy by our plans and dispositions, especially those
concerning the distribution of forces. This is just as feasible in defense, and
indeed it is a major weapon of the tactical defense.

We suggest that surprise lies at the root of all operations without

exception, though in widely varying degrees depending on the nature and
circumstances of the operation.

These variations may already originate in the characteristics of the army,

of the general, or even of the government.

The two factors that produce surprise are secrecy and speed. Both

presuppose a high degree of energy on the part of the government and the
commander; on the part of the army, they require great efficiency. Surprise
will never be achieved under lax conditions and conduct. But while the
wish to achieve surprise is common and, indeed, indispensable, and while it
is true that it will never be completely ineffective, it is equally true that by
its very nature surprise can rarely be outstandingly successful. It would be a
mistake, therefore, to regard surprise as a key element of success in war.

The principle is highly attractive in theory, but in practice it is often held up
by the friction of the whole machine.

space are limited in scale. Therefore in strategy surprise becomes more
feasible the closer it occurs to the tactical realm, and more difficult, the
more it approaches the higher levels of policy.

main assembly points generally requires the installation of supply dumps
and depots, as well as considerable troop movements, whose purpose can be
guessed soon enough.

attack or by preparations for war. In the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, when war often turned on sieges, a frequent and important aim
was to invest a fortress by surprise; but this too rarely proved successful.

requiring little time. It is often relatively simple to steal a march on the
enemy and in this way occupy a position, a topographical feature, or a road.
It is obvious, however, that the greater the ease with which surprise is
achieved, the smaller is its effectiveness, and vice versa. In the abstract, we
may believe that small surprises often lead to greater things, such as a
victorious battle or the capture of an important depot, but history does not
bear this out. Cases in which such surprises led to major results are very
rare. From this we may conclude how considerable are the inherent
difficulties.

him with their favorite theories, or with maxims and a smug parade of
technicalities. He must look at the facts. Take, for example, a certain day in
the Silesian campaign of 1761, which has achieved a kind of notoriety in
this connection. On 22 July Frederick the Great stole a march on Laudon,
moved to Nossen near Neisse, and thereby it is claimed prevented the
Austrian and Russian armies in upper Silesia from joining forces, thus
gaining a breathing spell of four weeks. If we study this event in the works
of the principal authorities,89 and consider the facts with an open mind, we
will find no such significance in this march, but rather inconsistencies in the
entire argument, fashionable as it has become, and much that is

unaccountable in Laudon’s movements during these famous maneuvers. No
one looking for truth and understanding could be satisfied with such a
historical example.

of a campaign, we think of strenuous activity, quick decisions, and forced
marches. But even in instances where these are present to a high degree,
they may not always produce the intended results, as is shown by two
commanders who can be considered supreme in these matters: Frederick the
Great and Bonaparte. In July 1760 the former suddenly pounced on Lacy
from Bautzen and then turned toward Dresden. But the interlude
accomplished little; indeed, it left Frederick considerably worse off than
before, for in the meantime Glatz had fallen.

not to mention his descent from upper Lusatia on Bohemia, but he was
unable to achieve his goal. Both actions were thrusts into thin air, which
cost him time and casualties and might have seriously endangered his
position at Dresden.

Major success in a surprise action therefore does not depend on the

energy, forcefulness, and resolution of the commander: it must be favored
by other circumstances. We do not wish to deny the possibility of success,
but merely want to establish the fact that it does require favorable
conditions, which are not often present, and can rarely be created by the
general.

Both the commanders whom we have just cited provide striking

examples of this: first Bonaparte, in 1814, in his famous operation against
Blücher’s forces, which were moving along the Marne, separated from the
main allied army. We can hardly imagine a greater result from an
unexpected advance carried out in two days. Blücher’s troops, strung out
over a distance of three days’ marches, were beaten separately, and suffered
casualties on the scale of a major battle. This was entirely due to surprise,
for Blücher’s order of march would have been different if he had known
that an attack by Bonaparte might be imminent. The French success
depended on Blücher’s mistake. Bonaparte, to be sure, did not know how
Blücher saw the situation; he benefited from a fortunate coincidence.

that he had only just occupied. Laudon was taken completely by surprise
and lost 70 cannon and 10,000 men. At that time Frederick was acting on
the principle of moving frequently in order to avoid battle, or at least in
order to frustrate the enemy’s plans; but this had not been his intention
when he changed his position on the night of 14-15 June. He moved, as he
says himself, because he was dissatisfied with the position he had occupied
that day. Here too chance played a large part, and the outcome would have
been different had it not been for the difficult, hilly terrain, and the
coincidence of Frederick’s nocturnal shift of position with the preliminary
phases of Laudon’s attack.

of momentous surprises. It will suffice to recall the brilliant campaigns of
the Great Elector against Sweden, sweeping from Franconia to Pomerania,
and from the Mark Brandenburg to the river Pregel. The campaign of 1757
and Bonaparte’s famous crossing of the Alps in 1800 are other examples. In
the latter case, the Austrian army surrendered its entire theater of
operations, and in 1757 another army came very close to surrendering not
merely its operational theater but itself as well. Finally Frederick’s invasion
of Silesia may be cited as an example of a totally unexpected war. In all
these cases the results were massive and far-reaching. Yet history has few
such events to report—unless, of course, we confuse them with instances of
states being ill-prepared for war because of sheer inactivity and lack of
energy, such as Saxony in 1756 and Russia in 1812.

the matter. Only the commander who imposes his will can take the enemy
by surprise; and in order to impose his will, he must act correctly. If we
surprise the enemy with faulty measures, we may not benefit at all, but
instead suffer sharp reverses. Our surprise, in that case, will cause the
enemy little worry; by exploiting our mistakes, he will find ways of
warding off any ill-effects. Since the offensive offers much more scope for
positive action than the defensive, the element of surprise is more often
related to the attack—but far from exclusively so, as we shall see later on.
Mutual surprises by the offensive and defensive may collide, in which case
the side will be justified and succeed that has hit the nail most squarely on
the head.

always happen in real life. For the side that can benefit from the
psychological effects of surprise, the worse the situation is, the better it may
turn out, while the enemy finds himself incapable of making coherent
decisions. This holds true not only for senior commanders, but for everyone
involved; for one peculiar feature of surprise is that it loosens the bonds of
cohesion, and individual action can easily become significant.

general moral superiority enables one opponent to intimidate and
outdistance the other, he can use surprise to greater effect, and may even
reap the fruits of victory where ordinarily he might expect to fail.

At first glance, it seems not unjust that the term “strategy” should be

derived from “cunning” and that, for all the real and apparent changes that
war has undergone since the days of ancient Greece, this term still indicates
its essential nature.

If we leave the actual execution of force, the engagement, to tactics, and

consider strategy as the art of skillfully exploiting force for a larger
purpose, and if we disregard for the moment such characteristics as fierce
ambition which acts like a compressed spring, great will-power which
yields only reluctantly, etc., no human characteristic appears so suited to the
task of directing and inspiring strategy as the gift of cunning. The universal
urge to surprise, discussed in the previous chapter, already points to this
conclusion: since each surprise action is rooted in at least some degree of
cunning.

Yet however much one longs to see opposing generals vie with one

another in craft, cleverness, and cunning, the fact remains that these
qualities do not figure prominently in the history of war. Rarely do they
stand out amid the welter of events and circumstances.

the previous chapter.

Strategy is exclusively concerned with engagements and with the

directions relating to them. Unlike other areas of life it is not concerned
with actions that consist only of words, such as statements, declarations,
and so forth. But words, being cheap, are the most common means of
creating false impressions.

Analogous things in war—plans and orders issued for appearances only,

false reports designed to confuse the enemy, etc.—have as a rule so little
strategic value that they are used only if a ready-made opportunity presents
itself. They should not be considered as a significant independent field of
action at the disposal of the commander.

To prepare a sham action with sufficient thoroughness to impress an

enemy requires a considerable expenditure of time and effort, and the costs
increase with scale of the deception. Normally they call for more than can
be spared, and consequently so-called strategic feints rarely have the
desired effect. It is dangerous, in fact, to use substantial forces over any
length of time merely to create an illusion; there is always the risk that
nothing will be gained and that the troops deployed will not be available
when they are really needed.

to lose the urge to play with sly mobility. Stern necessity usually permeates
direct action to such an extent that no room is left for such a game. In brief,
the strategist’s chessmen do not have the kind of mobility that is essential
for stratagem and cunning.

useful and essential asset for the commander than any gift for cunning—
though the latter will do no harm so long as it is not employed, as it all too
often is, at the expense of more essential qualities of character.

commander, the more appealing the use of cunning becomes. In a state of
weakness and insignificance, when prudence, judgment, and ability no
longer suffice, cunning may well appear the only hope. The bleaker the
situation, with everything concentrating on a single desperate attempt, the
more readily cunning is joined to daring. Released from all future
considerations, and liberated from thoughts of later retribution, boldness

and cunning will be free to augment each other to the point of concentrating
a faint glimmer of hope into a single beam of light which may yet kindle a
flame.

Incredible though it sounds, it is a fact that armies have been divided and

separated countless times, without the commander having any clear reason
for it, simply because he vaguely felt that this was the way things ought to
be done.

for dividing one’s forces never be proposed, as soon as concentration of
force is recognized as the norm, and every separation and split as an
exception that has to be justified.

not only destroys the weaker, but that its impetus carries the weaker force
along with it. This would seem not to allow a protracted, consecutive,
employment of force: instead, the simultaneous use of all means intended
for a given action appears as an elementary law of war.

In practice this is true, but only when war really resembles a mechanical

thrust. When it consists of a lengthy interaction of mutually destructive
forces, the successive employment of force certainly becomes feasible. That
is the case in tactics, primarily because tactics are chiefly based on fire
power; and there are other reasons as well. If in a fire-fight a thousand men
face five hundred, the sum of their losses may be calculated from the total
forces involved on both sides. A thousand men fire twice as many rounds as
five hundred, but of the thousand, more will be hit than of the five hundred,
for it must be assumed that the thousand will be deployed more closely. If
we suppose that they suffer twice as many hits, the losses on each side
would be equal. The five hundred, for example, would suffer two hundred
casualties, as would the thousand. Now, if the force of five hundred had
kept an equal number of men in reserve, out of range, eight hundred able-
bodied men would be available to each opponent. But on one side five
hundred men would be fresh and fully supplied with ammunition, while all
of the eight hundred facing them would be to some extent disorganized,
tired and short of ammunition. To be sure, it is not correct to assume that
because of their greater number the thousand would lose twice as many
men as the five hundred would have lost in their place. The greater loss
sustained by the side that held half of its strength in reserve must be

counted as a disadvantage. It must also be admitted that as a general rule the
thousand may initially have an opportunity of driving the enemy from his
position and forcing him to withdraw. Whether these two advantages
balance the disadvantage of opposing, with eight hundred somewhat battle-
weary men, an enemy not appreciably weaker and who has five hundred
completely fresh men, cannot be decided by further analysis. We must rely
on experience; and few officers who have seen action would not grant
superiority to the side with fresh troops.

It becomes clear why the deployment of too great a force may be

detrimental: no matter how great the advantage which superiority offers in
the first moment of the engagement, we mav have to pay for it in the next.

The danger, however, applies only to the phase of confusion, the

condition of disarray and weakness—in brief, the crisis that occurs in every
engagement, even on the victorious side. In the context of such a weakened
condition, the appearance of relatively fresh troops will be decisive.

On the other hand, as soon as the disorganizing effect of victory ceases,

and all that remains is the moral superiority caused by every victory, fresh
troops alone can no longer save the situation—they too will be swept away.
A beaten army cannot make a comeback the following day, merely by being
reinforced with strong reserves. Here we arrive at the source of a vital
difference between strategy and tactics.

Tactical successes, those attained in the course of the engagement,

usually occur during the phase of disarray and weakness. On the other
hand, the strategic success, the overall effect of the engagement, the
completed victory, whether great or insignificant, already lies beyond that
phase. The strategic outcome takes shape only when the fragmented results
have combined into a single, independent whole. But at that point the crisis
is over, the forces regain their original cohesion, weakened only by the
casualties they have actually suffered.

The consequence of this difference is that in the tactical realm force can

be used successively, while strategy knows only the simultaneous use of
force.

victory, we have reason to fear the immediate future. It follows that for the
first phase we should use only the amount of force that seems absolutely
necessary. The rest should be kept out of range of fire and out of hand-to-

hand fighting, so that we can oppose the enemy’s reserves with fresh troops
of our own or defeat his weakened forces with them. In a strategic situation
this does not hold true. For one thing, as has been shown, once a strategic
success is achieved, a reaction is less likely to set in, because the crisis has
passed; for another, not all strategic forces have necessarily been weakened.
The only troops that have suffered losses are those that have been tactically
engaged—those, in other words, that have fought. Provided they have not
been wasted, only the irreducible minimum will have been in action, far
from the total that has been strategically committed. Units that were
scarcely or not at all involved in the fighting, because of the army’s
superiority, and which contributed to success by their mere presence, are the
same after victory as they were before, and are as ready for further tasks as
if they had been completely inactive. It is obvious how greatly the margin
of strength provided by these units can contribute to the successful
outcome; it is equally understandable that their presence can substantially
reduce the losses sustained by the troops that are actually tactically
engaged.

used, and may even be reduced, and since obviously greater force is more
likely to lead to success, it naturally follows that we can never use too great
a force, and further, that all available force must be used simultaneously.

The truth of this proposition, however, needs to be established in another

area as well. So far we have only discussed combat itself. It is the essential
activity of war, but we must also consider men, time, and space, which are
the components of this activity. We must consider the effects of their
influence.

Fatigue, exertion, and privation constitute a separate destructive factor in

war—a factor not essentially belonging to combat, but more or less
intricately involved in it, and pertaining especially to the realm of strategy.
This factor is also present in tactical situations, and possibly in its most
intense form; but since tactical actions are of shorter duration, the effects of
exertion and privation will be limited. On the strategic plane, however,
where the dimensions of time and space are enlarged, the effects are always
perceptible, and often decisive. It is not unusual that a victorious army
suffers greater losses from sickness than from battle.

consider that of artillery fire and hand-to-hand fighting in the tactical realm,
we may well conclude that by the end of the campaign or some other
strategic period, everything exposed to the factor of destruction will be in a
weakened state, and that the appearance of new forces would be decisive. In
a strategic as well as in a tactical situation, therefore, we might be tempted
to seek initial success with a minimum of troops, in order to retain strong
reserves for the final struggle.

evaluate it correctly, we must scrutinize the separate ideas involved. First of
all, the notion of reinforcements must not be confused with the idea of fresh
and unused troops. Few campaigns end without the addition of new troops
seeming most desirable, indeed decisive, both to the winner and loser; but
that is not here an issue: reinforcements would not be needed at all if a large
enough force had been used in the first place. The notion that a fresh army
taking the field would have higher morale than troops already in action
(comparable to a tactical reserve, which does indeed rate higher than men
who have already suffered much) is completely discounted by experience.
Just as an unsuccessful campaign diminishes the courage and morale of the
troops, a successful one heightens these values. By and large then, these
factors tend to cancel each other out; the gain in experience is left as clear
profit. In any case, here we should study successful rather than unsuccessful
campaigns, since whenever failure can be predicted with any degree of
certainty, adequate force is lacking in the first place, and holding any part in
reserve for later use would be unthinkable.

by a unit from exertion and privation will increase in proportion to its size,
as would be the case in an engagement. The answer to that question must be
in the negative.

Exertion is mainly caused by the dangers which in varying degree are

inseparable from military operations. To counter these dangers everywhere,
to proceed on our course with confidence, is the object of much of the
activity comprising the tactical and strategic duties of the army. The weaker
an army, the more arduous this duty becomes; while the greater the army’s
superiority, the easier it becomes. Who can doubt this? A campaign against
a substantially weaker opponent will call for less exertion than a campaign

against an equally strong force, not to speak of one that is superior to our
own.

It consists mainly of lack of food and lack of shelter for the troops, either in
quarters or in comfortable camps. The problems of food and shelter
admittedly increase with the size of a force concentrated in one place. On
the other hand, does not this very superiority provide the best method of
spreading out over a greater area and thus finding more means of supply
and shelter?

along a single road in an unheard-of manner, causing equally unheard-of
shortages. This may be attributed to his principle that one can never be too
strong at the decisive point. Whether or not he pushed this principle too far
in this instance cannot be discussed here, but it is certain that, if he had
wanted to avoid these shortages, all he had to do was to advance on a
broader front. There was room enough in Russia; indeed, there would
almost always be enough space. Therefore this example provides no basis
for the claim that the simultaneous use of greatly superior forces will
produce greater suffering. Supposing, however, that wind and weather and
the unavoidable exertions of war had indeed weakened—in spite of the
relief afforded to the whole—even that part of the army which, as a surplus
force, could have been held in reserve for later use: it becomes even more
essential to look at the situation as a whole and ask whether this loss would
have equaled the gains that superior strength might have achieved in one
way or another.

is not too difficult to judge approximately how much force is needed to
achieve substantial success, and what would be superfluous. In strategy this
is practically impossible, because strategic success cannot be defined and
delineated with the same precision. What may be regarded as surplus
strength in a tactical situation must be considered in strategy as a means of
exploiting success if the opportunity arises. Since the margin of profit
increases with the scale of victory, superiority of force can quickly reach a
level which the most careful calculation of strength could never have
determined.

to Moscow in 1812 and occupy the city. If his superior strength had also
enabled him to crush the Russian army, he would probably have concluded
a peace in Moscow that would have been less readily attainable by other
means. We cite this example simply as an illustration; proof would require a
detailed exposition, which would here be out of place.

All these reflections deal only with the successive use of force. They are

not concerned with the idea of a reserve as such, though the two touch in
many points. That subject has additional ramifications, as the following
chapter will show.

of an engagement weakens the forces so that time becomes a factor in the
outcome, this is not the case in strategy. To the extent that in strategy time
does exert destructive effects on the forces involved, these are partly
mitigated by the size of the forces, and partly offset in other ways.
Consequently it cannot be the intent of the strategist to make an ally of time
for its own sake, by committing force gradually, step by step.

of factors that derive from but are not identical with it. Indeed it must be
significant for one opponent or the other. This is quite a different matter, by
no means trivial or unimportant, and will form the subject of later study.

The rule, then, that we have tried to develop is this: all forces intended

and available for a strategic purpose should be applied simultaneously; their
employment will be the more effective the more everything can be
concentrated a single action at a single moment.

place in strategy. They cannot be ignored, the less so since they form one of
the principal means toward a final success: the continuous deployment of
new forces. This too will be the subject of another chapter. We mention it
here only to avoid misunderstanding.

will clarify the whole matter—we mean, the strategic reserve.

But the need to hold a force in readiness for emergencies may also arise

in strategy. Hence there can be such a thing as a strategic reserve, but only
when emergencies are conceivable. In a tactical situation, where we
frequently do not even know the enemy’s measures until we see them,
where they may be hidden by every wood and every fold of undulating
terrain, we must always be more or less prepared for unforeseen
developments, so that positions that turn out to be weak can be reinforced,
and so that we can in general adjust our dispositions to the enemy’s actions.

Such cases also occur in strategy, since strategy is directly linked to

tactical action. In strategy too decisions must often be based on direct
observation, on uncertain reports arriving hour by hour and day by day, and
finally on the actual outcome of battles. It is thus an essential condition of
strategic leadership that forces should be held in reserve according to the
degree of strategic uncertainty.

In the defensive generally, particularly in the defense of certain natural

features such as rivers, mountain ranges, and so forth, we know this is
constantly required.

tactics; and it practically disappears in that area of strategy that borders on
the political.

only by actual observation—the point at which he plans to cross a river by
the few preparations he makes, which become apparent a short time in
advance; but the direction from which he threatens our country will usually
be announced in the press before a single shot is fired. The greater the scale
of preparations, the smaller the chance of achieving a surprise. Time and
space involved are vast, the circumstances that have set events in motion so
well known and so little subject to change, that his decisions will either be
apparent early enough, or can be discovered with certainty.

Moreover even if a strategic reserve should exist, in this area of strategy

its value will decrease the less specific its intended employment.

itself of no significance; all such partial actions await resolution in the
outcome of the battle as a whole.

In turn, the outcome of the battle as a whole has only relative

significance, which varies in numerous gradations according to the size and
overall importance of the defeated force. The defeat of a corps may be
made up for by the victory of an army, and even the defeat of one army may
be balanced or even turned into a victory by the successes of a larger army,
as happened in the two days’ fighting at Kulm in 1813. No one can doubt
this; but it is equally clear that the impact of every victory, the successful
outcome of every battle, gains in absolute significance with the importance
of the defeated force, and consequently the possibility of recouping such
losses at a later encounter also becomes less likely. This point will be
examined more closely later on; for the present, it is enough to call attention
to the existence of this progression.

tactical situation always postpones the main decision to the end of the
action, in strategy the law of the simultaneous use of forces nearly always
advances the main decision, which need not necessarily be the ultimate one,
to the beginning. These three conclusions, therefore, justify the view that a
strategic reserve becomes less essential, less useful, and more dangerous to
use, the more inclusive and general its intended purpose.

contradictory is not difficult to determine: it comes when the decisive stage
of the battle has been reached. All forces must be used to achieve it, and
any idea of reserves, of available combat units that are not meant to be used
until after this decision, is an absurdity.

unforeseen maneuver by the enemy but also of reversing the unpredictable
outcome of combat when this becomes necessary, strategy must renounce
this means, at least so far as the overall decision is concerned. Setbacks in
one area can, as a rule, be offset only by achieving gains elsewhere, and in a
few cases by transferring troops from one area to another. Never must it
occur to a strategist to deal with such a setback by holding forces in reserve.

meant to contribute to the overall decision. The point is so obvious that we
should not have devoted two chapters to it if it were not for the fact that the
idea can look somewhat more plausible when veiled in other concepts, as
indeed it frequently is. One man thinks of a strategic reserve as the peak of
wise and cautious planning, another rejects the whole idea, including that of
a tactical reserve. This kind of confused thinking does actually affect
reality. For a striking example, we should recall that in 1806 Prussia billeted
a reserve of 20,000 men under Prince Eugene of Württemberg in
Brandenburg and could not get them to the Saale River in time, while
another 25,000 men were kept in East and south Prussia to be mobilized at
some later stage, to act as a reserve.

These examples will, we hope, spare us the reproach of tilting at

windmills.

sure that all forces are involved—always to ensure that no part of the whole
force is idle. If a segment of one’s force is located where it is not
sufficiently busy with the enemy, or if troops are on the march—that is, idle
—while the enemy is fighting, then these forces are being managed
uneconomically. In this sense they are being wasted, which is even worse
than using them inappropriately. When the time for action comes, the first
requirement should be that all parts must act: even the least appropriate task
will occupy some of the enemy’s forces and reduce his overall strength,
while completely inactive troops are neutralized for the time being.
Obviously this view is a corollary of the principles developed in the last
three chapters. It is the same truth, restated from a somewhat broader point
of view, and reduced to a single concept.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

In tactics time and space are rapidly reduced to their absolute minimum.

A unit that is attacked in flank and rear will soon reach the stage where its
chance of retreat has vanished: in such a situation it comes close to being
completely unable to continue the fight, and the commander must either try
to extricate himself from this predicament or prevent it from occurring at
all. For this reason all tactical arrangements aimed at envelopment are
highly effective, and their effectiveness consists largely in the concern they

induce about their consequences. That is why the geometric factor in the
disposition of forces is so important.

concern for great spans of time and space. Armies do not burst from one
theater of war into another; rather, a projected strategic envelopment may
easily take weeks and months to carry out. Besides, distances are so great
that the chances of even the best measures finally achieving the desired
result remain slight.

geometric pattern, is much smaller; on the other hand the effect of an
advantage gained at one point is much greater. This advantage can be
exploited to the full, before countermeasures interfere or even cancel it out.
In consequence we do not hesitate to consider it an established truth that in
strategy the number and scale of the engagements won are more meaningful
than the pattern of the major lines connecting them.

that in this way they would increase the importance of strategy. Strategy,
they thought, expressed the higher functions of the intellect; they thought
that war would be ennobled by its study, and, according to a modern
substitution of concepts, be made more scientific. We believe that it is one
of the chief functions of a comprehensive theory of war to expose such
vagaries, and it is because the geometrical element usually provides the
point of departure for these fantasies that we have drawn special attention to
it.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

Even if we suppose that circumstances could be completely balanced, or

if we assume that insufficient knowledge of their mutual circumstances
gives the commanders the impression that such equality exists, the
differences in their political purpose will still rule out the possibility of a
standstill. Politically, only one can be the aggressor: there can be no war if
both parties seek to defend themselves. The aggressor has a positive aim,
while the defender’s aim is merely negative. Positive action is therefore
proper to the former, since it is the only means by which he can achieve his
ends. Consequently when conditions are equal for both parties the attacker
ought to act, since his is the positive aim.

Seen in this light, suspension of action in war is a contradiction in terms.

Like two incompatible elements, armies must continually destroy one

another. Like fire and water they never find themselves in a state of
equilibrium, but must keep on interacting until one of them has completely
disappeared. Imagine a pair of wrestlers deadlocked and inert for hours on
end! In other words, military action ought to run its course steadily like a
wound-up clock. But no matter how savage the nature of war, it is fettered
by human weaknesses; and no one will be surprised at the contradiction that
man seeks and creates the very danger that he fears.

progress toward the goal, that it becomes apparent that immobility and
inactivity are the normal state of armies in war, and action is the exception.
This might almost make us doubt the accuracy of our argument. But if this
is the burden of much of military history, the most recent series of wars
does substantiate the argument. Its validity was demonstrated and its
necessity was proved only too plainly by the revolutionary wars. In these
wars, and even more in the campaigns of Bonaparte, warfare attained the
unlimited degree of energy that we consider to be its elementary law. We
see it is possible to reach this degree of energy; and if it is possible, it is
necessary.

in war, unless action is intended! A baker fires his oven only when he is
ready to bake bread; horses are harnessed to a carriage only when we intend
to drive; why should we make the enormous exertions inherent in war if our
only object is to produce a similar effort on the part of the enemy?

So much in justification of the general principle. Now for its

modifications, insofar as they arise from the nature of the subject and do not
depend on individual circumstances.

and prevent the clockwork from running down rapidly or without
interruption.

thus becomes a retarding influence, is the fear and indecision native to the
human mind. It is a sort of moral force of gravity, which, however, works
by repulsion rather than attraction: namely, aversion to danger and
responsibility.

In the fiery climate of war, ordinary natures tend to move more

ensure that momentum is maintained. To understand why the war is being
fought is seldom sufficient in itself to overcome this ponderousness. Unless
an enterprising martial spirit is in command, a man who is as much at home
in war as a fish is in water, or unless great responsibilities exert a pressure,
inactivity will be the rule, and progress the exception.

The second cause is the imperfection of human perception and judgment,

which is more pronounced in war than anywhere else. We hardly know
accurately our own situation at any particular moment, while the enemy’s,
which is concealed from us, must be deduced from very little evidence.
Consequently it often happens that both sides see an advantage in the same
objective, even though in fact it is more in the interest of only one of them.
Each may therefore think it wiser to await a better moment, as I have
already explained in Chapter Five of Book Two.91

The third determinant, which acts like a rachet-wheel, occasionally

stopping the works completely, is the greater strength of the defensive. A
may not feel strong enough to attack B, which does not, however, mean that
B is strong enough to attack A. The additional strength of the defensive is
not only lost when the offensive is assumed but is transferred to the
opponent. Expressed in algebraic terms, the difference between A + B and
A—B equals 2 B. It therefore happens that both sides at the same time not
only feel too weak for an offensive, but that they really are too weak.

Thus, in the midst of the conflict itself, concern, prudence, and fear of

excessive risks find reason to assert themselves and to tame the elemental
fury of war.

But these determinants are hardly adequate explanations for the long

periods of inactivity that occurred in earlier wars, in which no vital issues
were at stake, and in which nine-tenths of the time that the troops spent
under arms was occupied by idleness. As stated in the chapter on the
Purpose and Means in War, this phenomenon is mainly due to the influence
that the demands of the one belligerent, and the condition and state of mind
of the other, exert on the conduct of the war.

These factors can become so influential that they reduce war to

something tame and half-hearted. War often is nothing more than armed
neutrality, a threatening attitude meant to support negotiations, a mild
attempt to gain some small advantage before sitting back and letting matters

take their course, or a disagreeable obligation imposed by an alliance, to be
discharged with as little effort as possible.

is little hostile spirit, where we neither want to do much harm to the enemy
nor have much to fear from him, in short where no great motive presses and
promotes action, governments will not want to risk much. This explains the
tame conduct of such conflicts, in which the hostile spirit of true war is held
in check.

solid are the bases that are available to theory: essentials become rarer, and
accidents multiply.

Nevertheless, even this type of conflict gives scope to intelligence;

possibly even wider and more varied scope. Gambling for high stakes
seems to have turned into haggling for small change. In this type of war,
where military action is reduced to insignificant, time-killing flourishes, to
skirmishes that are half in earnest and half in jest; to lengthy orders that add
up to nothing; to positions and marches that in retrospect are described as
scientific, simply because their minute original motive has been forgotten
and common sense cannot make anything of them—in this type of conflict
many theorists see the real, authentic art of war. In these feints, parries, and
short lunges of earlier wars they find the true end of all theory and the
triumph of mind over matter. More recent wars appear to them as crude
brawls that can teach nothing and that are to be considered as relapses into
barbarism. This view is as petty as its subject. In the absence of great forces
and passions it is indeed simpler for ingenuity to function; but is not
guiding great forces, navigation through storms and surging waves, a higher
exercise of the intellect? That other, formalized type of swordsmanship is
surely included and implicit in the more energetic mode of conducting war.
It has the same relation to it as the movements on a ship have to the motion
of the ship. It can only be carried on so long as it is tacitly understood that
the opponent follows suit. But is it possible to tell how long this condition
will be observed? The French Revolution surprised us in the false security
of our ancient skills, and drove us from Châlons to Moscow. With equal
suddenness, Frederick the Great surprised the Austrians in the quiet of their
antiquated ways of war, and shook their monarchy to its foundations. Woe
to the government, which, relying on half-hearted politics and a shackled

military policy, meets a foe who, like the untamed elements, knows no law
other than his own power! Any defect of action and effort will turn to the
advantage of the enemy, and it will not be easy to change from a fencer’s
position to that of a wrestler. A slight blow may then often be enough to
cause a total collapse.

All of these reasons explain why action in war is not continuous but

spasmodic. Violent clashes are interrupted by periods of observation, during
which both sides are on the defensive. But usually one side is more strongly
motivated, which tends to affect its behavior: the offensive element will
dominate, and usually maintain its continuity of action.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

Bonaparte’s audacity and luck have cast the old accepted practices to the

winds. Major powers were shattered with virtually a single blow. The
stubborn resistance of the Spaniards, marred as it was by weakness and
inadequacy in particulars, showed what can be accomplished by arming a
people and by insurrection. The Russian campaign of 1812 demonstrated in
the first place that a country of such size could not be conquered (which
might well have been foreseen),92 and in the second that the prospect of
eventual success does not always decrease in proportion to lost battles,
captured capitals, and occupied provinces, which is something that
diplomats used to regard as dogma, and made them always ready to
conclude a peace however bad. On the contrary, the Russians showed us
that one often attains one’s greatest strength in the heart of one’s own
country, when the enemy’s offensive power is exhausted, and the defensive
can then switch with enormous energy to the offensive. Prussia taught us in
1813 that rapid efforts can increase an army’s strength six times if we make
use of a militia, and, what is more, that the militia can fight as well in
foreign countries as at home. All these cases have shown what an enormous
contribution the heart and temper of a nation can make to the sum total of
its politics, war potential, and fighting strength. Now that governments have
become conscious of these resources, we cannot expect them to remain
unused in the future, whether the war is fought in self-defense or in order to
satisfy intense ambition.

Obviously, wars waged by both sides to the full extent of their national

strength must be conducted on different principles from wars in which
policy was based on the comparative size of the regular armies. In those
days, regular armies resembled navies, and were like them in their relation

to the country and to its institutions. Fighting on land therefore had
something in common with naval tactics, a quality which has now
completely disappeared.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

THE DYNAMIC LAW IN WAR

When fighting is interrupted, in other words when neither side has a

positive aim, a state of rest and equilibrium results; equilibrium, naturally,
in its widest sense, covering not only physical and psychological forces, but
all circumstances and motives. As soon as one side adopts a new and
positive aim and begins to pursue it however tentatively, as soon as the
opponent resists tension of forces builds up. This tension lasts until the
immediate issue has been decided: either one side renounces its goal, or the
other side concedes it.

This decision, which is always derived from the results of the

combinations of actions that are developed by both sides, is followed by
movement in one direction or the other.

When this movement has been exhausted, either through the difficulties it

has met, such as the frictions that are inherent in any action, or through new
opposing forces, inactivity returns, or a new cycle of tension and decision
begins, followed by further movement—usually in the opposite direction.

This theoretical distinction between balance, tension, and movement has

a greater practical application than may at first appear.

A state of rest and equilibrium can accommodate a good deal of activity;

that is to say, the kind of activity arising from incidental causes, and not
designed to lead to major changes. Significant engagements, even major
battles, may take place; but these actions are still of a different nature and
therefore usually have different results.

because greater will-power and greater pressure of circumstances are
involved, and partly because everything is already prepared for major
action. In this situation the effect resembles the explosion of a carefully
sealed mine, while an event of similar proportions which takes place during
a period of rest is more like a flare-up of gunpowder in the open air.

The state of tension is obviously a matter of degree. Numerous

gradations are possible as it approaches the state of rest, the last stage being
so close as to make it difficult to distinguish one condition from the other.

The most significant lesson drawn from these observations is that any

move made in a state of tension will be more important, and will have more
results, than it would have if made in a state of equilibrium. In times of
maximum tension this importance will rise to an infinite degree.

The cannonade of Valmy decided more than the battle of Hochkirch.
If the enemy abandons territory because he is unable to defend it, we can

use this territory in a different manner than if the enemy’s retreat were
undertaken with the intention of fighting under more favorable
circumstances. A badly chosen position or a single miscalculated move on
our part during the course of a strategic attack by the enemy may have fatal
results, while in a state of equilibrium such blunders would have to be
glaring indeed to arouse the enemy’s reaction at all.

As we have mentioned, most former wars were waged largely in this

state of equilibrium, or at least expressed tensions that were so limited, so
infrequent, and feeble, that the fighting that did occur during these periods
was seldom followed by important results. Instead a battle might be fought
to celebrate the birthday of a monarch (Hochkirch), to satisfy military honor
(Kunersdorf), or to assuage a commander’s vanity (Freiberg).

circumstances and act in concert with their spirit. The experience of the
campaign of 1806 has shown the extent to which this capacity may at times
be missing. During that period of enormous tension, events were pressing
toward a major decision which, with all its consequences, ought to have
absorbed the full attention of the commander; yet at that very time, plans
were proposed and even partly carried out, such as the reconnaissance in
Franconia, that in a state of equilibrium could at most have caused a slight
tremor. But these confusing schemes and time-consuming ideas dissipated

activity and energy that should have gone into the really urgent measures
that alone could have saved the day.

The distinction we have made is also necessary to the further

development of our theory. Everything we shall have to say about the
relation between attack and defense and the way in which this polarity
develops refers to the state of crisis in which the forces find themselves
during periods of tension and movement. By contrast, all activity that
occurs during a state of equilibrium will be regarded and treated as a mere
corollary. The state of crisis is the real war; the equilibrium is nothing but
its reflex.

BOOK FOUR

The framework of the engagement is tactical; a broad survey will

familiarize us with its general appearence. Every engagement has a specific
purpose that gives it its peculiar characteristics, and these special purposes
will be examined later. Compared with the general characteristics of
fighting, the peculiarities tend to be relatively unimportant, with the result
that most engagements are very much alike. Rather than have to refer
repeatedly to these common features, we intend to deal with them at once,
before discussing their special applications.

In the following chapter we shall first give a short description of the

tactical course of battle today, since it is the basis of our concept of fighting.

OceanofPDF.com

What usually happens in a major battle today? The troops move calmly

into position in great masses deployed in line and depth. Only a relatively
small proportion is involved, and is left to conduct a firefight for several
hours, interrupted now and then by minor blows—charges, bayonet assaults
and cavalry attacks—which cause the fighting to sway to some extent to
and fro. Gradually, the units engaged are burned out, and when nothing is
left but cinders, they are withdrawn and others take their place.

So the battle slowly smolders away, like damp gunpowder. Darkness

brings it to a halt: no one can see, and no one cares to trust himself to
chance. The time has come to reckon up how much in the way of
serviceable troops is left on either side—troops, that is, which are not yet
burned out like dead volcanoes. One estimates how much ground has been
won or lost, as well as the degree of security in one’s rear. The results,
along with personal impressions of the bravery and cowardice, intelligence
and stupidity that one thinks one has observed in one’s own troops and the
enemy’s, are then combined in an overall impression on which a decision is
based: either to quit the field or to renew the fight in the morning.

This description does not claim to be a full picture of a modern battle—it

is merely meant to give a broad impression. It applies equally to attacker
and defender. Specific features, such as the particular objective or the nature
of the terrain, may be added without changing the general impression.

Contemporary armies have developed almost identically in military
organization and methods; the element of war itself, stirred up by great
national interests, has become dominant and is pursuing its natural ccurse.
Battles will not change their character so long as both these conditions hold
good.

have to determine the value of various coefficients, such as strength, terrain,
and so forth. The description is valid only for general, great and decisive
engagements and those that approximate to them; lesser ones have changed
in the same manner, but not to the same extent. Proof of this will be found
in tactics, but we shall have further opportunities for adding details that will
make this clearer.

Engagements mean fighting. The object of fighting is the destruction or

defeat of the enemy. The enemy in the individual engagement is simply the
opposing fighting force.

This is the simple concept, and we shall return to it. But first we must

introduce a number of other considerations.

If a state with its fighting forces is thought of a single unit, a war will

naturally tend to be seen in terms of a single great engagement. Under the
primitive conditions of savage peoples this generally holds true. But our
wars today consist of a large number of engagements, great and small,
simultaneous or consecutive, and this fragmentation of activity into so
many separate actions is the result of the great variety of situations out of
which wars can nowadays arise.

Even the ultimate aim of contemporary warfare, the political object,

cannot always be seen as a single issue. Even if it were, action is subject to
such a multitude of conditions and considerations that the aim can no longer
be achieved by a single tremendous act of war. Rather it must be reached by
a large number of more or less important actions, all combined into one
whole. Each of these separate actions has a specific purpose relating to the
whole.

We have already said that the concept of the engagement lies at the root

of all strategic action, since strategy is the use of force, the heart of which,
in turn, is the engagement. So in the field of strategy we can reduce all
military activity to the unitary concept of the single engagement, and
concern ourselves exclusively with its purposes. We will come to identify
these purposes as we discuss the circumstances that give rise to them in the
engagement. Here it is enough to say that every engagement, large or small,

has its own particular purpose which is subordinate to the general one. That
being so, the destruction and subjugation of the enemy must be regarded
simply as a means toward the general end, which it obviously is.

because of the connection between these various concepts. We have brought
up this connection only in order to get it out of the way.

his forces, whether by death, injury, or any other means—either completely
or enough to make him stop fighting. Leaving aside all specific purposes of
any particular engagement, the complete or partial destruction of the enemy
must be regarded as the sole object of all engagements.

the particular purpose that both distinguishes the action and links it to the
war as a whole is only a slight modification of the general purpose of the
war or a subsidiary purpose connected with it. It is important enough to
give the action its particular character, but of little weight compared to that
overall purpose. If the subsidiary purpose alone is fulfilled, only an
unimportant part of the objective has been achieved. If we are right, then
the notion according to which the destruction of the enemy forces is only
the means, while the ends are bound to be quite different, is only generally
true. We would reach the wrong conclusion unless we bear in mind that this
very destruction of the enemy’s forces is also part of the final purpose. That
purpose itself is only a slight modification of the destructive aim.

Ignoring this point led to completely wrong ideas before the recent wars,

creating fashions and fragmentary systems through which theory became
elevated far above everyday practice; the more so, since theory attached
less importance to the use of the real instrument—the destruction of the
enemy’s forces.

No such system could, of course, have been conceived without other

erroneous assumptions, and without replacing the concept of destruction of
the enemy’s forces by different ideas wrongly assumed to be effective. We
shall expose these as opportunity arises, but we cannot deal with the
engagement without reasserting its importance and true value, and
suggesting the errors to which a strictly formal view might lead.

How are we to prove that usually, and in all the most important cases, the

destruction of the enemy’s forces must be the main objective? How are we

to counter the highly sophisticated theory that supposes it possible for a
particularly ingenious method of inflicting minor direct damage on the
enemy’s forces to lead to major indirect destruction; or that claims to
produce, by means of limited but skillfully applied blows, such paralysis of
the enemy’s forces and control of his will-power as to a constitute a
significant shortcut to victory? Admittedly, an engagement at one point may
be worth more than at another. Admittedly, there is a skillful ordering of
priority of engagements in strategy; indeed that is what strategy is all about,
and we do not wish to deny it. We do claim, however, that direct
annihilation of the enemy’s forces must always be the dominant
consideration. We simply want to establish this dominance of the
destructive principle.

tactics. We are therefore not discussing the tactical means used to destroy a
maximum of enemy force with a minimum of effort. By direct destruction
we mean tactical success. We maintain therefore that only great tactical
successes can lead to great strategic ones; or as we have already said more
specifically, tactical successes are of paramount importance in war.

absorbed by complex operations. The question whether a simple attack or a
more complex one will be the more effective will certainly be answered in
favor of the latter if one assumes the enemy to be passive. But every
complex operation takes time; and this time must be available without a
counterattack on one of its parts interfering with the development of the
whole. If the enemy decides on a simpler attack, one that can be carried out
quickly, he will gain the advantage and wreck the grand design. So, in the
evaluation of a complex attack, every risk that may be run during its
preparatory stages must be weighed. The scheme should only be adopted if
there is no danger that the enemy can wreck it by more rapid action.
Wherever this is possible we ourselves must choose the shorter path. We
must further simplify it to whatever extent the character and situation of the
enemy and any other circumstances make necessary. If we abandon the
weak impressions of abstract concepts for reality, we will find that an
active, courageous, and resolute adversary will not leave us time for long-
range intricate schemes; but that is the very enemy against whom we need

these skills most. It seems to us that this is proof enough of the superiority
of the simple and direct over the complex.

should not swing wider than latitude allows. The probability of direct
confrontation increases with the aggressiveness of the enemy. So, rather
than try to outbid the enemy with complicated schemes, one should, on the
contrary, try to outdo him in simplicity.

the other, courage. One may be tempted to believe that moderate courage
coupled with great intelligence will be more effective than moderate
intelligence and great courage. But, unless these factors are assumed to be
unreasonably disproportionate, one is not entitled to consider intelligence as
superior to courage in a field whose very name is danger—one which must
be regarded as courage’s proper realm.

leading to a different conclusion, is the very source of our conviction, and
lies at the root of this train of thought.

among all the military virtues, the energetic conduct of war has always
contributed most to glory and success.

of enemy forces must be regarded as the main objective; not just in the war
generally, but in each individual engagement and within all the different
conditions necessitated by the circumstances out of which the war has
arisen. For the moment we have simply been concerned to establish its
general importance, and can now return to the engagement.

What do we mean by “destruction of the enemy’s forces?” A reduction of

strength relatively larger than our own. Equal absolute losses will, of
course, mean smaller relative losses to the side with numerical superiority,
and can therefore be considered an advantage. But having stripped the
engagement of all other objects, we must also exclude that of using it to
effect indirectly a greater destruction of the enemy forces. Consequently,
only the direct profit gained in the process of mutual destruction may be
considered as having been the object. This profit is absolute: it remains
fixed throughout the entire balance sheet of the campaign and in the end
will always prove pure gain. Any other type of victory over the enemy
would either have its basis in other objectives, which we are not discussing
here; or would yield only a temporary and relative profit. An example will
clarify this.

If by skillful deployment one can place the enemy at such a disadvantage

that he cannot continue fighting without risk, and if after some resistance he
retreats, we can say that at this point we have beaten him. But, if we have
lost proportionately as many men in the process as he did, no trace of this
so-called victory will show up in the final balance-sheet of the campaign.
Getting the better of an enemy—that is, placing him in a position where he

has to break off the engagement—cannot in itself be considered as an
objective, and for this reason cannot be included in the definition of the
objective. Nothing remains, therefore, but the direct profit gained in the
process of destruction. This gain includes not merely the casualties inflicted
during the action, but also those which occur as a direct result of his retreat.

It is a familiar experience that the winner’s casualties in the course of an

engagement show little difference from the loser’s. Frequently there is no
difference at all, and sometimes even an inverse one. The really crippling
losses, those the vanquished does not share with the victor, only start with
his retreat. The feeble remnants of badly shaken battalions are cut down by
cavalry; exhausted men fall by the wayside; damaged guns and caissons are
abandoned, while others are unable to get away quickly enough on poor
roads and are taken by the enemy’s cavalry; small detachments get lost in
the night and fall defenseless into the enemy’s hands. Thus a victory usually
only starts to gather weight after the issue has already been decided. This
would be a paradox, if it were not resolved as follows.

Physical casualties are not the only losses incurred by both sides in the

course of the engagement: their moral strength is also shaken, broken and
ruined. In deciding whether or not to continue the engagement it is not
enough to consider the loss of men, horses and guns; one also has to weigh
the loss of order, courage, confidence, cohesion, and plan. The decision
rests chiefly on the state of morale, which, in cases where the victor has lost
as much as the vanquished, has always been the single decisive factor.

The ratio of physical loss on either side is in any case hard to gauge in

the course of an engagement; but this does not apply to loss of morale.
There are two main indicators of this. One is loss of the ground on which
one has fought; the other is the preponderance of enemy reserves. The faster
one’s own reserves have shrunk in relation to the enemy’s, the more it has
cost to maintain the balance. That alone is palpable proof of the enemy’s
superior morale, and it seldom fails to cause some bitterness in a general—a
certain loss of respect for the forces he commands. But the main point is
that soldiers, after fighting for some time, are apt to be like burned-out
cinders. They have shot off their ammunition, their numbers have been
diminished, their strength and their morale are drained, and possibly their
courage has vanished as well. As an organic whole, quite apart from their
loss in numbers, they are far from being what they were before the action;

and thus the amount of reserves spent is an accurate measure on the loss of
morale.

reasons for retreat. There may, however, be others, which we do not wish to
exclude or minimize, having to do with the interdependence of the parts or
with the overall plan.

strength. Whoever has the greater sum of both left at the end is the victor.

factor. Once the outcome has been determined, the loss continues to
increase, and reaches its peak only at the end of the action. This becomes
the means of achieving the margin of profit in the destruction of the
enemy’s physical forces which is the real purpose of the engagement. Loss
of order and cohesion often makes even the resistance of individual units
fatal for them. The spirit of the whole is broken; nothing is left of the
original obsession with triumph or disaster that made men ignore all risks;
for most of them danger is no longer a challenge to their courage, but harsh
punishment to be endured. Thus the tool is weakened and blunted at the
first impact of the enemy’s victory, and is no longer suitable for countering
danger with danger.

This is the time for the victor to consolidate his gains by physical

destruction—the only advantage that will be permanently his. The enemy’s
morale will gradually recover, order will be restored, his courage will
return; and in most cases only a very small portion, if any, of the hard-
earned superiority will remain. In some, admittedly rare, instances a thirst
for revenge and an increased surge of animosity may even produce the
opposite effect. But the advantages gained by inflicting casualties, in dead,
wounded, prisoners, and captured material, can never disappear from the
ledger.

after the battle, they are usually greater in terms of captured guns and
prisoners. While the former are shared more or less evenly by winner and
loser, the latter are not. For that reason they are usually only found on one
side, or at any rate in significant numbers on one side.

That is why guns and prisoners have always counted as the real trophies

of victory: they are also its measure, for they are tangible evidence of its

scale. They are a better index to the degree of superior morale than any
other factors, even when one relates them to the casualty figures. And
through this, the factor of morale makes itself felt in yet another way.

immediate aftermath is gradually restored and often shows no trace of its
disruption. While this is the case with smaller parts of the whole, it also
happens with larger segments. It can even be the case with the entire army;
but rarely, if ever, can it be true of the state and the government that the
army serves. At that level, things are seen more objectively and from a
higher standpoint. The degree of one’s own weakness and inadequacy
shows up only too clearly in the amount of trophies taken by the enemy and
their ratio to the casualties sustained.

because it has no absolute value and does not always show up in the final
balance. It can attain such massive proportions that it overpowers
everything by its irresistible force. For this reason it may in itself become a
main objective of the action, which we shall discuss elsewhere. Here we
have still to consider some of its other basic features.

to the amount of the military forces involved, but does so at an accelerating
rate. This is because the increase is one not merely of size but of intensity.
In a defeated division, order is easily restored. As the body’s warmth
restores the circulation in a limb numb with cold, a division’s spirit is
quickly revived by the spirit of the army when the two join up again. Thus
even if the effects of a minor victory do not disappear altogether, they are
partially lost to the enemy. But this is not the case where the army itself has
suffered a disastrous defeat: everything collapses together. One large fire is
a great deal hotter than several small ones.

of a victory is the ratio of the opposing forces. If a small force beats a larger
one, its gain is not only doubled but it shows a greater margin of general
superiority, which the loser knows he may have to face again and again.
Actually, however, this effect is hardly noticeable in such a case. At the
moment of battle, information about the strength of the enemy is usually
uncertain, and the estimate of one’s own is usually unrealistic. The stronger
party either simply refuses to admit the disproportion, or at least will

underrate it, and is therefore to a large extent protected from the
psychological disadvantage to which it would give rise. The actual facts,
which have been suppressed by ignorance, vanity, or even deliberate
prudence, will emerge only much later, when history is written. History by
that time will probably glorify the army and its commander, but its
contribution to morale will no longer be of any help in a situation that has
long since passed.

personified, its true crystallization then, the engagement, will most likely be
planned so as to obtain them. In this, destruction of the enemy by killing
and wounding appears only as a means.

concern of strategy. However, it does affect the engagement when it comes
to threatening the enemy’s rear and protecting one’s own. It is upon this that
the number of prisoners and captured guns will mainly depend, and tactical
measures will not suffice on their own when strategic circumstances are
unfavorable.

finding one’s retreat cut off, tend to paralyze movement and the ability to
resist, and so affect the balance between victory and defeat. What is more,
in the case of defeat, they increase the losses and can raise them to their
very limit—to annihilation. A threat to the rear can, therefore, make a
defeat more probable, as well as more decisive.

and particularly in engagements, large and small, to protect one’s own rear
and to gain control of the enemy’s. The instinct is derived from the concept
of victory itself, which as we have shown, is more than mere killing.

universal one. No engagement is conceivable in which it would not
accompany, in one or both its forms, the naked application of force. Not
even the smallest unit will attack the enemy without thinking of its line of
retreat, and usually it will seek out the enemy’s as well.

It would go too far to discuss how easily a complex situation can deflect

this instinct from its natural course, how often it has to yield to weightier
considerations. We shall content ourselves by stating it as a general law of
the nature of engagements. It must be considered universally valid; its

natural pressure is ubiquitous and thus it becomes the point around which
almost all tactical and strategic moves revolve.

consists of three elements:

1. The enemy’s greater loss of material strength
2. His loss of morale
3. His open admission of the above by giving up his intentions.
 
Casualty reports on either side are never accurate, seldom truthful, and in

most cases deliberately falsified. Even the number of trophies is usually
unreliably reported; thus, where they are not considerable, they may leave
the victory in doubt as well. Trophies apart, there is no accurate measure of
loss of morale; hence in many cases the abandonment of the fight remains
the only authentic proof of victory. In lowering one’s colors one
acknowledges that one has been at fault and concedes in this instance that
both might and right lie with the opponent. This shame and humiliation,
which must be distinguished from all other psychological consequences of
the transformation of the balance, is an essential part of victory. It is the
only element that affects public opinion outside the army; that impresses the
people and the governments of the two belligerents and of their allies.
Granted, abandoning an intention is not the same as abandoning the
battlefield, even after prolonged and stubborn fighting. An outpost may
retire after a stubborn resistance without being accused of abandoning its
task. Even in engagements intended to destroy the enemy, withdrawal from
the battlefield does not always imply that the aim has been abandoned, as
for instance in planned retreats in which it is intended to dispute every foot
of ground. All this will be discussed later under the heading of the
particular purposes of engagements. For the present, we only wish to draw
attention to the fact that in the majority of cases it is difficult to distinguish
between the abandonment of intentions and the abandonment of the
battlefield; the impression produced by the former, both in military and
civilian circles, should not be underrated.

For generals and armies without an established reputation, this is a

difficult aspect of otherwise sound operations. A series of engagements
followed by retreats may appear to be a series of reverses. This may be

quite untrue, but it can make a very bad impression. It is not possible for a
general in retreat to forestall this moral effect by making his true intentions
known. To do so effectively, he would have to disclose his overall plan of
action, and that would be contrary to his main interests.

To demonstrate the exceptional importance of this concept of victory, we

would recall the battle of Soor, in which the trophies taken were
insignificant (a few thousand prisoners and twenty guns). Frederick the
Great proclaimed his victory by remaining on the battlefield for five more
days, although his retreat toward Silesia already had been decided on and
was demanded by the general situation. As he said himself, he counted on
the psychological impact of the victory to bring him nearer peace. Even
though a few more victories (such as the engagement of Katholisch-
Hennersdorf in Lusatia and the battle of Kesselsdorf) were needed to
establish this peace, one cannot say that the battle of Soor had no moral
effect.

increased the number of trophies to an unusual degree, then the lost
engagement turns into defeat on a scale not produced by every victory.
Since in this type of débacle the morale of the defeated is affected to a far
higher degree, a total inability to offer resistance is frequently the result,
and action will now consist in evasion—that is to say, flight.

Jena and Belle-Alliance93 were defeats on this scale; Borodino was not.
Since the difference is merely a matter of degree, it would be pedantic to

draw an arbitrary line. Still, for the clear distinction of theoretical ideas, it is
essential to maintain certain concepts as focal points. It is in fact a
weakness in our terminology that in the case of a major defeat we do not
have a single word to designate the victory that corresponds to it, or in the
case of a less far-reaching victory a word to designate the corresponding
degree of defeat.

to conceive, and it is possibly also most natural in fact, that all the forces on
each side should unite in one great mass, and all successes should consist of
one great thrust of these forces. There is much to be said for this idea and
on the whole it would be salutary to adhere to it and, to begin with, to
consider the smaller engagements as necessary by-products, like wood-
shavings. However, the matter is never disposed of so easily as this.

The multiplication of engagements obviously results from the splitting up

of forces, and we shall therefore deal with the specific purposes of
individual engagements in that context. These purposes, and with them the
whole range of engagements, can be classified; and a study of these
classifications will help to elucidate our discussion.

The destruction of the enemy’s forces is admittedly the purpose of all

engagements. But, other purposes may well be linked to this and may even
predominate. A distinction must therefore be made between a case in which
destruction of enemy forces is the main consideration and one in which it is
more of a means. Apart from the destruction of the enemy’s forces, the
conquest of a locality or of a physical object may also be a general motive,
either by itself or in conjunction with other motives, in which case one
motive will usually predominate. The two main forms of war, attack and
defense, which we shall discuss shortly while not affecting the first of these
objectives, do affect the other two. A chart would show the following:

reconnaissance and demonstrations, in which obviously none of the above
fits the purpose of the action. Indeed, a fourth category ought to be allowed.
Strictly speaking, reconnaissances aimed at making the enemy show
himself, feints designed to wear him out, demonstrations meant to pin him
down at one place or to draw him off toward another are aims that can be
achieved only indirectly and on the pretext of one of the three objectives
named above (usually the second); for the enemy who wants to reconnoiter
must act as if he were about to attack and defeat or dislodge our forces, and
so forth. But such pretexts are not the real aim, which is what concerns us
here. Therefore, to the three objectives of the attacker we must add a fourth:
that of misleading the enemy—in other words, putting up a sham fight. The
very nature of the matter makes it obvious that this object is conceivable
only in the context of attack.

On the other hand, we must observe that the defense of a locality may be

of two kinds: either absolute, if the locality is not to be given up at all, or
relative, if it must be held only for a certain time. The latter form constantly
recurs in engagements fought by advance posts and rear guards.

There is probably no need to stress that the differing purposes of an

engagement affect the preparations that are made for it. We make one plan
for dislodging an enemy post and another for annihilating it; one plan for
holding a locality at all costs and another for merely delaying the enemy. In
the former case, there is little need to worry about the retreat; in the latter,
the retreat is of paramount importance; and so on.

These reflections come under the heading of tactics, and are here cited

only as examples. How the various aims of an engagement look from the
strategic angle will be studied in the chapters that deal with them. For the
present, we will confine ourselves to a few general observations.

To begin with, the relative importance of aims diminishes roughly in the

order of the foregoing table. The first of them should always predominate in

a major battle. Finally, the last two in the defensive engagement are of a
kind that do not really bring results: they are completely negative, and their
value can only be the indirect one of making some positive purpose
elsewhere easier to achieve. If engagements of this type become too
frequent, it obviously indicates an unfavorable strategic situation.

In a sense, the duration of an engagement can be interpreted as a

separate, secondary success. The decision can never be reached too soon to
suit the winner or delayed long enough to suit the loser. A victory is greater
for having been gained quickly; defeat is compensated for by having been
long postponed.

This is true in general. It assumes practical importance in engagements

whose object is a delaying action.94

In such a case, the whole success often consists in nothing but the time

the action takes. That is why we include duration in the spectrum of
strategic elements.

The duration of an engagement and the broad conditions under which it

is fought are necessarily connected. These conditions are the size of the
force, its relation in men and material to the opponent, and the character of
the terrain. Twenty thousand men will not wear each other down so rapidly
as will two thousand. An enemy with a two- or threefold superiority cannot
be resisted for as long as one of equal strength. A cavalry engagement is
decided faster than an infantry engagement, and this in turn is decided faster
than an action in which artillery is involved. One cannot make progress so
rapidly in mountains and forests as on a plain. All this is obvious enough.

It follows that the strength, composition, and deployment of the two sides

must all be taken into account if the objective of the engagement lies in its
duration. But it is less important to state this rule than to show its
connection with its principal results, which we know about from
experience.

The resistance of a normal division of eight to ten thousand men of all

arms, even against a significantly superior enemy and on not very favorable

terrain, lasts for several hours; if the enemy is only slightly superior, if at
all, it may last half a day. A corps of three or four divisions can hold out for
twice that time, and an army of eighty to one hundred thousand men for
three or four times as long. For that length of time, then, these forces may
be left to their own resources. And if within this time additional forces are
brought to bear, no second engagement takes place, but their effectiveness
quickly blends with the success of the original engagement into a single
whole.

more closely the moment of decision and, consequently, termination of the
engagement.

New troops are often vainly sacrificed in an engagement that is past

retrieving; and the chance of reversing a decision is often missed while it
could still be done. Let us cite two examples that can hardly be more
striking.

At Jena in 1806 Prince Hohenlohe, with 35,000 men, accepted battle

against Bonaparte’s 60 to 70,000. He lost so badly that his whole force was
virtually annihilated. At that point, General Rüchel, with about 12,000 men,
decided to reopen the action, with the result that his force too was
demolished on the spot.

The same day at Auerstädt saw 25,000 men fight until noon against

Davout’s 28,000. Admittedly the force was not successful, but neither was
it in a state of dissolution, and suffered no greater losses than the enemy,
who had no cavalry. General Kalckreuth’s reserve, 18,000 men strong, was
not used to turn the tide of battle; if it had been, a Prussian defeat would
have been impossible.

Every engagement is a whole, made up of subsidiary engagements that

add up to the overall result. The decision of the engagement consists in this
total result. The result need not be the type of victory described in Chapter
Six. Often no preparations have been made for one, or no opportunity arises
because the enemy gives way too soon. Even after stubborn resistance, the

decision is normally reached sooner than is the kind of success generally
associated with the idea of victory.

We may, therefore, ask what normally constitutes this moment of

decision, this point of no return at which fresh (though of course not
disproportionate) forces will be too late to save the day?

Excluding feints, which by their very nature do not lead to a decision, we

arrive at the following answers:

1. Where the purpose of the engagement is the possession of some

mobile object, the decisive moment is reached when this object is lost.

2. Where the purpose of the engagement is the possession of a certain

locality, the decisive moment is usually though not invariably reached,
when this locality is lost. This holds true only if the locality is of great
defensive strength; terrain that is easily overrun, no matter how great
its importance in other respects, can be recaptured without great
difficulty.

3. In all cases in which the above conditions have not already led to a

decision, and in particular where the main objective is the destruction
of the enemy’s forces, the moment of decision comes when the victor
ceases to be in a state of disarray and thus to some extent ineffective;
in other words, when the successive application of force as discussed
in Chapter 12 of Book III, is no longer advantageous. That is why we
designate this point as central to the strategic unity of the engagement.

 
Thus, an engagement cannot be retrieved if the attacking force has lost

little if any of its cohesion and effectiveness, or if it has recovered from a
temporary loss of effectiveness, while the defender has become more or less
disorganized.

The smaller the proportion of troops in actual combat, and the larger the

proportion that contributed to victory merely by being present as a reserve,
the less is a new enemy force likely to deprive us of victory. The
commander and the army who have come closest to conducting an
engagement with the utmost economy of force and the maximum
psychological effect of strong reserves are on the surest road to victory. In
modern times the French must be credited with great mastery in this
respect, particularly under the leadership of Bonaparte.

crisis and recover his former effectiveness. A cavalry picket chasing the
enemy posthaste can regain its proper order in a few minutes, and that is the
extent of the whole crisis. A whole cavalry regiment will need more time.
Even more time is required by infantry after it has been deployed in
skirmishing order. Divisions of all arms, which have become dispersed,
need more time still; the engagement has caused a disruption of order
aggravated by the fact that no part knows exactly where any other is. Thus
the larger the total effort involved, the longer is the moment delayed when
the victor is able to retrieve, repair, and rearrange his used tools from their
state of untidy confusion, and restore order in the workshop of combat.

still in the critical phase; another, if the terrain is rough and wooded. On the
other hand, it must be remembered in connection with these factors that
night is a great source of protection. Conditions rarely provide a night
attack with much promise of success. An excellent case in point is York’s
attack on Marmont at Laon on 10 March 1814. Like night, rough and
wooded country can shield an army from counterattack while victory is still
in the critical phase. Both of these factors—night, and rough and wooded
country—therefore make it harder rather than easier to renew the fight.

So far we have treated the rapid reinforcement of the losing side as a

simple addition to its strength, with support coming up from the rear, which
is what normally happens. But an entirely different situation arises when the
reinforcements attack the enemv’s flank or rear.

The effectiveness of flank or rear attacks is a subject we shall deal with

later from the point of view of strategy. The kind of attack we are
discussing now, designed to turn the tide of battle, is in the main a tactical
affair; we shall discuss it at this point only because we are now concerned
with tactical results, and the subject therefore does overlap into the field of
tactics.

The impact of a force may be substantially heightened if it is directed at

the enemy’s flank or rear. But this is not invariably the case: the impact may
just as easily be weakened. The conditions under which the engagement is
being fought will dictate its plan in this as in all other respects, but this is
not the place to go into detail. For our present purpose, there are two
important considerations.

outcome more favorably than they do the decision itself. When an
engagement has to be retrieved, obviously the prime consideration is its
favorable conclusion rather than the magnitude of the victory. In this
respect, one would think, therefore, that reinforcements brought up to save
the situation would be less effective if they attacked the opponent’s flank
and rear, operating separately, than if they united with us. There is certainly
no lack of examples for this; but we maintain that because of a second
consideration the opposite will usually be true.

accompanies the appearance of reinforcements sent to restore a situation.

rear; in the critical phase of victory an army is strung out and dispersed, and
less capable of dealing with it. At the beginning, while the troops are still
concentrated and always prepared for such an eventuality, an attack in flank
or rear would carry relatively little weight; during the last moments of an
engagement it will mean a great deal more.

are much more effective when approaching the enemy from flank and rear,
just as a longer handle gives greater leverage. In that way it is possible to
restore an engagement with a force that would have been insufficient if used
against the front. Here, in operations on the flank or rear, where
effectiveness almost defies precise calculation because moral effects
become dominant, boldness and daring are given fullest scope.

combined effect assessed, if we wish to decide whether anything can still be
done to retrieve an engagement that is going badly.

opened by the arrival of reinforcements, will merge with it and lead to a
combined result. The initial loss would then be entirely erased. The
situation is different if the original engagement has already been decided: in
that case there will be two distinct results. When the reinforcements arc
only of moderate strength—in other words not up to that of the enemy—
prospects for the second round are hardly bright. But if they are strong
enough to fight the second engagement irrespective of the first, a favorable

outcome may possibly compensate or outweigh the initial defeat, though it
will never be able to cancel its effects completely.

left wing at the first assault and captured seventy guns. By the time the
battle ended, both gains had been lost again, and the whole result of the first
attack had vanished from the record. Had the King been able to stand on his
first success and delay the second round until the following day, the first
day’s gains would still have been a compensation even if he had lost the
second part of the battle.

success, the initial loss not only disappears from the record, but becomes
the basis for a greater victory. For on closely examining the tactical
progress of an engagement it becomes obvious that, up to its very end, the
results of each of the subsidiary engagements are only suspended verdicts,
which not only may be revoked by the final outcome, but may be turned
into their very opposites. The more our own forces have suffered, the more
exhausted the enemy will be. His own crisis is likely to be that much greater
and the superiority of our fresh forces will weigh all the more. If the final
result turns out to be in our favor, if we manage to recapture battlefield and
trophies from the enemy, then all the forces that these have cost him will
turn out to the credit of our account; our earlier defeat becomes a stepping-
stone to greater triumph. The most brilliant military exploits, which in
victory would have meant so much to the enemy that he could have ignored
their cost, now leave him with nothing but remorse over the strength thus
sacrificed. The magic of victory and the curse of defeat can change the
specific gravity of the elements of battle.

could easily requite his victory with a greater one, it is better to retrieve a
losing battle (provided it is sufficiently important) before its close, rather
than fight a second engagement later on.

help while the latter was still in action; but after the battle had been lost he
did not attempt to attack Frederick, though that was well within his powers.

be considered merely as a necessary evil, and avoided wherever they are not
essential.

There is yet another deduction to be examined.
The outcome of a lost battle must not be taken as an argument for

deciding on a new one; rather, any such decision must be based on the rest
of the circumstances. That precept, however, is counteracted by a
psychological factor that must be reckoned with: the instinct for retaliation
and revenge. It is a universal instinct, shared by the supreme commander
and the youngest drummer boy; the morale of troops is never higher than
when it comes to repaying that kind of debt. All this of course presupposes
that the defeated troops do not constitute too large a portion of the whole; if
they do, such a feeling would be overpowered by that of impotence.

order to recapture what has been lost by seeking a new engagement,
particularly if the rest of the situation warrants it. The very nature of such a
second engagement decrees that in most cases it should be an attack.

kind of retribution; major battles, on the other hand, usually spring from too
many other causes to be based on such a relatively trivial motive.

Blücher, on 14 February 1814, to return to the field with a third force after
two of his corps had been beaten at Montmirail three days earlier. Had he
known it would bring him face to face with Bonaparte himself, he would
surely have felt justified in saving his vengeance for another day; but he
expected to avenge himself on Marmont. Far from garnering the fruits of a
noble desire for retaliation, he had to pay the price for his miscalculation.

on the duration of the engagement and the moment of its decision. If a
single engagement is intended, their deployment will be a matter of tactics;
but it can be considered as such only where the forces are so close as to
exclude the possibility of two separate engagements—in other words,
where the area within which all of the action takes place may be
strategically considered as a single point. It does frequently happen in war,
however, that forces meant to fight in concert have to be placed so far apart
that, while their conjunction in battle remains the primary intention, the
possibility of seperate action has also to be considered. Such a deployment
is therefore strategic.

divisions, advance guards and flanking corps, reserves intended to support
more than one strategic point, the concentration of individual corps from
widely spread billets, and so forth. It is obvious that this is a constantly
recurring type of operation—the small change, so to speak, of the strategic
budget, while important battles and other operations comparable in scale
may be considered its gold and silver.

The discussions of these writers frequently turn on the point that one

commander has offered battle and that the other has refused to accept it.

An engagement is however a very peculiar form of duel. Its basis does

not consist only in mutual desire or willingness to fight, but in the purposes
involved; and those always belong to a larger whole—the more so because
the war itself, considered as a single conflict, is governed by political aims
and conditions that themselves belong to a larger whole. As a result, the
mutual desire for victory assumes a minor role; rather, it ceases to be
independent, and has to be regarded as no more than the nerve which
enables the higher political will to act.

In ancient times, and again more recently when standing armies first

came into being, the expression “vainly offering battle to the enemy” had
more meaning than it has today. In the ancient world a battle meant a trial of
strength on open ground, free of all obstacles. The art of war consisted
wholly in organization and formation—in other words, in the order of
battle.

In those days armies were generally so well entrenched in their camps

that these positions were thought to be impregnable. A battle became
possible only after the enemy left camp and entered the lists, so to speak, on
accessible terrain.

Hence, when we read that Hannibal vainly offered battle to Fabius, all we

learn about Fabius is that a battle did not figure in his plan. This does not
prove either the material or moral superiority of Hannibal. Yet the
expression is correct so far as the latter is concerned: Hannibal genuinely
wanted to fight.

In the early days of modern armies, conditions governing major

engagements and battles were similar. Thus large masses of troops were
deployed in action and directed in accordance with a set order of battle.
This was a large, unwieldy arrangement requiring fairly even ground: in
rough or wooded, not to speak of mountainous areas the system was
unsuitable for attack or even for defense. To some degree, then, the
defending side was able to find ways of avoiding battle. These conditions
lasted, though steadily to a lesser extent, until the first Silesian Wars. Only
in the Seven Years War did an attack in difficult terrain become feasible and
customary. While terrain was still an asset to those who chose to utilize it, it
had ceased to be a magic circle that was regarded as out of bounds to the
natural forces of war.

further in this respect. Today there is nothing to prevent a commander bent
on a decisive battle from seeking out his enemy and attacking him. If he
does not, he cannot be considered to have wanted the engagement; today if
he says that he has offered battle but that the enemy refused it, it merely
means that he did not think conditions favorable for an engagement. It is an
admission on his part to which that expression does not apply; he uses it
only as an excuse.

It is true that while the defender cannot nowadays decline an

engagement, he can avoid it by abandoning his position, and thereby his
object in holding it. But this kind of success already constitutes the better
part of victory for the attacker—the recognition of his provisional
superiority.

implies a tacit agreement between opponents) in order to justify inertia on
the side whose move it is—that of the attacker. The defender, on the other
hand, must be considered as wanting battle so long as he does not retreat.
For his part, he may claim to have offered battle if he is not attacked; but
that will be considered self-evident.

forced into battle by his opponent. Frequently, however, the attacker is not
content with the advantages provided by such a retreat and feels the need
for an actual victory. In such a case remarkable skill is often used to find

and apply the few available means of forcing even an evasive opponent to
stand and fight.

enemy and cut off his retreat, or make it so difficult that battle seems to him
the lesser evil; and second, to take him by surprise. The advantages of the
latter were in the past based on the difficulty of all movement, but surprise
has lost its usefulness today. Modern armies are so flexible and mobile that
a general will not shrink from retreat even in full view of the enemy. Real
difficulties will arise only for forces operating in exceptionally
disadvantageous terrain.

Archduke Charles fought Moreau in the Rauhe Alp for no other reason than
to facilitate his own retreat. We must confess, however, that in this instance
we have never entirely understood the reasoning of the famous general and
writer.

the allied armies never really intended to attack Frederick the Great.

because a retreat in full view of the enemy seemed a risky operation. But
the King has also cited other reasons for the battle.

always be very rare; and those in which the enemy is forced to fight
because he has been surrounded will usually involve only isolated corps,
such as Fink’s at the battle of Maxen.

Secondary objectives may combine with the principal one even in a

battle, and the battle itself will be colored by the circumstances that gave
rise to it. Even a battle is connected with a still larger entity of which it is
only a part. But since the essence of war is fighting, and since the battle is
the fight of the main force, the battle must always be considered as the true
center of gravity of the war. All in all, therefore, its distinguishing feature is
that, more than any other type of action, battle exists for its own sake alone.

This has a bearing on the manner of its decision, and on the effect of the

victory that is gained, and determines the value that theory must ascribe to
the battle as a means to the end. That is why, at this point, we are making it
a subject of special study. Later we will discuss the particular ends that may
also be involved, but which leave its character—assuming it deserves the
name of “Battle”—essentially unchanged.

If a battle is primarily an end in itself, the elements of its decision must

be contained in it. In other words, victory must be pursued so long as it lies
within the realm of the possible; battle must never be abandoned because of
particular circumstances, but only when the strength available has quite
clearly become inadequate.

How can this stage be more accurately determined?
Where some degree of complex integration and deployment of the army

is the principal condition under which the courage of the troops can gain a
victory (as was the case for a considerable time in modern warfare), then
the destruction of this line of battle is itself the decision. A wing overrun
and driven out of line decides the fate of the flank that has held fast. If, as in

an earlier period, the essence of defense lies in the close integration of
troops with the terrain and its obstacles, so that the army and the position
are one, then the capture of an essential point of the position brings about
the decision. We say that the key to the position is lost; it can no longer be
defended, the battle cannot be continued. In both cases the defeated armies
may be compared to the broken strings of an instrument that no longer
function.

tended to keep the armies in a state of rigid tension which prevented them
from using their strength down to the last man. These principles have now
lost so much of their influence that they are no longer dominant. An army
still goes into battle in a certain order, but this order is no longer decisive.
Defense is still improved by exploiting the accidents of terrain, but it no
longer relies on these alone.

the character of a modern battle. This description pictures the order of battle
simply as a disposition of troops designed to facilitate their use, and the
course of battle as a slow process of mutual attrition that will reveal which
side can first exhaust its opponent.

give up the fight depends on the relative strength of unused reserves still
available. They are the forces whose morale is still intact; mauled and
battered battalions—dying embers left by the furnace of destruction—
cannot be compared to them. Lost ground, as we have pointed out, is also
an index of impaired morale. It must also be taken into account, though
more as an indicator of losses suffered than as a loss in itself. The main
concern of both commanders will always be the number of reserves
available on both sides.

manner. Often this shape has already been decisively determined by the
preliminary dispositions made for the battle, and then it shows lack of
insight in the commander who opens the engagement under these
unfavorable conditions without being aware of them. Even if the course of
battle is not predetermined, it is in the nature of things that it consists in a
slowly shifting balance, which starts early, but, as we have said, is not
easily detectable. As time goes on, it gathers momentum and becomes more

obvious. It is less a matter of oscillating to and fro, as fanciful accounts of
combat have misled many people into thinking.

whether it swings to one side, rights itself, and then swings to the other, it is
certain that a commander usually knows that he is losing the battle long
before he orders retreat. Battles in which one unexpected factor has a major
effect on the course of the whole usually exist only in the stories told by
people who want to explain away their defeats.

who we are sure will confirm our argument for those of our readers who
have no personal experience of war. A thorough analysis of the process
would take us too far into the realm of tactics, where it really belongs. What
matters at this point is only the outcome.

While we believe that the defeated commander is usually aware of the

likelihood of defeat long before he decides to concede the battle, we also
admit that there are contrary cases; otherwise we should be stating a self-
contradictory tenet. If a battle were to be considered lost each time it took a
definite turn, no additional forces would be committed in the hope of saving
it. It follows that such a definite turn could not precede the moment of
retreat by any appreciable amount of time. There are certainly cases in
which a battle, after taking a definite turn in favor of one side, ended up in
favor of the other, but such cases are not common; in fact they are unusual.
But it is just this exceptional case that every general hopes for when his
luck is out; he has to hope for it so long as there is any chance of a turn for
the better. He hopes that by dint of greater efforts, by raising whatever
morale is left in the troops, by surpassing himself or by sheer good fortune,
he will be able to reverse his fortunes just once more, and he will keep at it
for as long as his courage and his judgment allow. We shall have more to
say about this later, but first we wish to enumerate the signs that indicate a
change in equilibrium.

The outcome of the battle as a whole is made up of the results of its

constituent engagements; these, in turn, may be recognized by three distinct
signs.

The first is the psychological effect exerted by the commanding officer’s

moral stamina. If a divisional commander sees his battalions being worsted,
it will show in his attitude and his reports, and these in turn will affect the

commander-in-chief’s decisions. Even local setbacks that appear to have
been retrieved will therefore count for something in the end. The
impressions made on the mind of the commander-in-chief will easily
accumulate even against his better judgment.

that of the enemy’s. This may be estimated quite accurately, since the tempo
of our battles is deliberate and seldom very tumultuous.

The third is the amount of ground lost.
All these indicators serve as a kind of compass by which a commander

can tell the direction in which his battle is going. The loss of entire batteries
while none are captured from the enemy; the crushing of his battalions by
the enemy’s cavalry while the enemy’s own battalions remain impenetrable;
the involuntary retreat of his firing line from point to point; futile efforts to
capture certain positions, which end in the scattering of the assault troops
by well-aimed grape and case-shot; a weakening of the rate of fire of his
guns as opposed to the enemy’s; an abnormally rapid thinning out of his
battalions under fire caused by groups of able-bodied men accompanying
the wounded to the rear; units cut off and captured because the battle line is
disrupted; evidence of the line of retreat being imperiled: all this will
indicate to a commander where he and his battle are heading. The longer
they are headed in that direction, the more definite the movement becomes,
the more difficult it will be to effect a change, and the closer comes the time
when the battle has to be conceded. That is the moment we shall now
consider.

turns on the ratio of unused reserves still available. A commander who
recognizes his enemy’s distinct superiority in reserves will decide to retreat.
It is a peculiarity of modern battles that all the mishaps and losses sustained
in its course can be retrieved by fresh troops. The reason lies in the modern
order of battle and the way in which troops are brought into action,
permitting the use of reserves almost everywhere and in any situation.
Therefore so long as a commander has more reserves than his enemy, he
will not give up even though the battle shows signs of going badly. But
once his reserves start to become weaker than the enemy’s, the end is a
foregone conclusion. His remaining moves depend partly on the
circumstances, and partly on the degree of the commander’s personal

courage and endurance, which may well deteriorate into unwise obstinacy.
Just how a general arrives at a correct estimate of the ratio of reserves on
each side is a matter of skill and experience, and does not concern us here.
What does concern us is the result as it emerges from his thinking. Even
this is not yet the real moment of decision: an answer that emerges only
gradually is not the proper catalyst for that; it can not do more than broadly
influence the ultimate decision which will in turn be triggered off by
immediate considerations. Of these there are two that recur constantly: a
threat to the line of retreat and the approach of night.

the line of retreat, and if reserves have been reduced to the point at which
they can no longer relieve the pressure, there is no other solution than to
submit to fate, and to save, by means of an orderly retreat, all that would be
lost by further delay and scattered through flight and defeat.

Night is a different matter in that it normally puts a stop to all

engagements, for special conditions must obtain to justify night operations.
Since for a retreat darkness is more advantageous than daylight, a
commander who feels that a retreat is unavoidable, or at least very likely,
will prefer to use night for this purpose.

factors, there may be many others which are less important, more
individual, and less predictable. The more the balance of a battle threatens
to be upset, the more sensitive it will be to anything that happens to any of
its constituent parts. The loss of a single battery, or dispersal by a cavalry
charge, may serve to confirm a general’s already partially formed decision
to retreat.

A final word on this subject must deal with the point at which a general’s

courage and his better judgment come, so to speak, into conflict with one
another.

On the one hand, there is the domineering pride of a victorious

conqueror, the inflexible determination that goes with innate obstinacy, and
the desperate resistance of noble enthusiasm, all of which refuse to abandon
a field of battle where honor is involved. On the other, there is the voice of
reason counseling against spending all one has, against gambling away
one’s last resources, and in favor of retaining whatever is necessary for an
orderly retreat. No matter how highly rated the qualities of courage and

steadfastness may be in war, no matter how small the chance of victory may
be for the leader who hesitates to go for it with all the power at his disposal,
there is a point beyond which persistence becomes desperate folly, and can
therefore never be condoned. In that most famous of all battles, Belle-
Alliance, Bonaparte staked his last remaining strength on an effort to
retrieve a battle that was beyond retrieving; he spent every last penny, and
then fled like a beggar from the battlefield and the Empire.

Three things are easily distinguished here: the effect upon the instruments

themselves—the generals and their armies; the effect on the belligerent
states; and the actual influence that those effects can have on the future
course of the war.

If one considers only the insignificant difference between the winning

and the losing side that exists on the battlefield in terms of killed and
wounded, prisoners and captured arms, the consequences resulting from
such an unimportant feature often seem quite inconceivable. Yet as a rule
the course of events is all too natural.

As we have already mentioned in Chapter Seven, the scale of a victory

does not increase simply at a rate commensurate with the increase in size of
the defeated armies, but progressively. The outcome of a major battle has a
greater psychological effect on the loser than on the winner. This, in turn,
gives rise to additional loss of material strength, which is echoed in loss of
morale; the two become mutually interactive as each enhances and
intensifies the other. So one must place a special emphasis on the moral
effect, which works in opposite directions on each side: while sapping the
strength of the loser, it raises the vigor and energy of the winner. But the
defeated side is the one most affected by it, since it becomes the direct
cause of additional loss. Moreover it is closely related to the dangers,
exertions, and hardships—in brief, to all the wear and tear inseparable from
war. It merges with these conditions and is nurtured by them.

On the victor’s side, however, all these factors only serve to increase the

scope of his courage. So what happens is that the loser’s scale falls much

further below the original line of equilibrium than the winner’s scale rises
above it. That is why, in considering the effects of a victory, we are
particularly interested in those that manifest themselves on the losing side.

These effects are greater after a large-scale action than after a minor one,

and greater still after a major battle than after an ancillary engagement. A
major battle exists for its own sake, for the sake of the victory it is to bring
and which it seeks by means of maximum exertion. A defeat of the enemy
in this place and at this time is the intention on which all strands of the war
plan converge, uniting all remote hopes and vague concepts concerning the
future. Here fate presents us with the answer to our bold question. This is
what causes the tension that weighs not only on the commander, but on the
whole army, down to the last wagon driver; in diminishing degrees, to be
sure, but in diminishing importance as well. A major battle, in all ages and
under whatever conditions, has never been fought as an extemporaneous,
unexpected, or meaningless discharge of military duty. It is a grandiose
event, well above the run of daily life, partly on its own merits and partly
because the commander has so planned it in order to raise the general
psychological tension. The higher the degree of suspense concerning the
outcome of the issue, the greater its effect will be.

the earlier wars of the modern period. If modem battle is, as we have
depicted it, a fight to the finish, the outcome is decided more by the sum of
all strengths, physical as well as moral, than by individual dispositions or
mere chance.

another day will bring a better deal from luck or chance, but the sum total
of physical and moral strength is not so susceptible to rapid change.
Therefore the judgment pronounced by a victory seems to be of greater
importance for the future. While only a few of those involved in a battle,
inside the army or out, will be conscious of that difference, the very course
of the battle itself will impress the result on the minds of all who actually
took part in it. Public accounts of the battle, even if they are embellished by
a few added details, will make it fairly evident to the rest of the world as
well that the causes were general rather than particular.

hard to form a vivid and thus altogether true picture of it: abstract concepts

of this or that minor loss will never match the reality of a major defeat. The
matter is worth closer examination.

indeed one’s intellect, is the melting away of numbers. This is followed by a
loss of ground, which almost always happens, and can even happen to the
attacker if he is out of luck. Next comes the break-up of the original line of
battle, the confusion of units, and the dangers inherent in the retreat, which,
with rare exceptions, are always present to some degree. Then comes the
retreat itself, usually begun in darkness, or at any rate continued through the
night. Once that begins, you have to leave stragglers and a mass of
exhausted men behind; among them generally the bravest—those who have
ventured out farthest or held out longest. The feeling of having been
defeated, which on the field of battle had struck only the senior officers,
now runs through the ranks down to the very privates. It is aggravated by
the horrible necessity of having to abandon to the enemy so many worthy
comrades, whom one had come to appreciate especially in the heat of battle.
Worse still is the growing loss of confidence in the high command, which is
held more or less responsible by every subordinate for his own wasted
efforts. What is worse, the sense of being beaten is not a mere nightmare
that may pass; it has become a palpable fact that the enemy is stronger. It is
a fact for which the reasons may have lain too deep to be predictable at the
outset, but it emerges clearly and convincingly in the end. One may have
been aware of it all along, but for the lack of more solid alternatives this
awareness was countered by one’s trust in chance, good luck, Providence,
and in one’s own audacity and courage. All this has now turned out to have
been insufficient, and one is harshly and inexorably confronted by the
terrible truth.

spirit will never panic in the face of defeat; even others panic in the wake of
a lost battle only in exceptional cases. The impressions themselves are
unavoidable in the best of armies. Here and there they may be tempered by
long familiarity with war and victory, by solid trust in the high command,
but they are never entirely absent at the outset. Moreover, they are not a
mere consequence of the loss of trophies; these are normally lost at a later
stage, and the fact does not become common knowledge right away. No
matter how slowly and gradually the shift in balance occurs, emotions of

this weakened condition (which, to repeat, is aggravated by all the routine
difficulties of war) it can hardly be expected to retrieve its losses by
renewed exertions. Before the battle, the two sides were in balance, real or
assumed; this balance has now been upset, and an outside cause is needed
to restore it. Without such external support, any further exertions will only
result in further loss.

start a steady sinking of the opponent’s scale, until a change in external
factors produces a new turn of events. Failing that, if the winner presses on
in search of greater prizes and greater glory, only an outstanding
commander and an army filled with military spirit, steeled and tempered in
numerous campaigns, will be able to keep the swollen torrent of power
within bounds and to slow its tide by making small but frequent stands until
the force of victory has run its course and spent itself.

The effect of all of this outside the army—on the people and on the

government—is a sudden collapse of the most anxious expectations, and a
complete crushing of self-confidence. This leaves a vacuum that is filled by
a corrosively expanding fear which completes the paralysis. It is as if the
electric charge of the main battle had sparked a shock to the whole nervous
system of one of the contestants. This effect may differ from case to case,
but it always exists to some degree. In place of an immediate and
determined effort by everyone to hold off further misfortune, there is a
general fear that any effort will be useless. Men will hesitate where they
should act, or will even dejectedly resign themselves and leave everything
to fate.

wai depend partly on the character and talent of the victorious commander;
but even more on the conditions that gave rise to the victory and on those
conditions that victory creates in turn. Unless a commander is bold and
enterprising, no great results can be expected from even the most brilliant
victory; but it can be rendered ineffectual even more quickly by major
adverse circumstances. A Frederick the Great, had he been in Daun’s place,

victory will be explored in their proper context. At that point we shall be
able to explain the disparity which may, at first glance, seem to exist
between the dimensions of a victory and those of its consequences. All too
often it is blamed on lack of energy on the part of the victor. What concerns
us here is only the battle itself. Our argument is that the effects of victory
that we have described will always be present; that they increase in
proportion to the scale of the victory; and that they increase the more the
battle is a major one—that is, the more the army’s full strength is
committed, the more this strength represents the total military force, and the
more the latter represents the whole state.

victory must necessarily be accepted as given? Should he not rather try to
find an effective way of dealing with them? It seems natural to answer in
the affirmative; but Heaven protect us from being misled into this blind
alley which has trapped so many theorists, and where the argument
becomes self-annihilating.

These effects are indeed quite inevitable, being based on the nature of the

case. They must follow even if we find ways of counteracting them, as the
movement of a cannonball must continue in the direction of the earth’s
rotation, even if it loses some of its speed by being fired in the opposite
direction—that is, from east to west.

All war presupposes human weakness, and seeks to exploit it.
While, then, at a later stage and in another context, we may discuss what

should be done after a major defeat; while we shall review the assets that
still remain in an almost hopeless case: and while we shall assume it
possible, even in such a situation, that everything can still be put to rights,
we certainly do not suggest that the effects of a major defeat can gradually
be wiped out altogether. The forces and the means employed to restore the
situation could have been used for a positive purpose; and this applies to
moral as well as to physical forces.

It is another question whether defeat in a major battle may be

instrumental in arousing forces that would otherwise have remained

dormant. That is not impossible; it has actually occurred in many countries.
But to evoke such an intensified reaction lies outside the limits of the art of
war; only where there is reason to expect it can the strategist take it into
consideration.

actually appear to be injurious because of the reaction aroused—cases that
are very rare exceptions indeed—we must be the more ready to recognize
the possibility of differences in the consequences of a given victory—here
dependent on the character of the people or state defeated.

1. Destruction of the enemy forces is the overriding principle of war, and,

so far as positive action is concerned, the principal way to achieve our
object.

2. Such destruction of forces can usually be accomplished only by

fighting.

3. Only major engagements involving all forces lead to major success.
4. The greatest successes are obtained where all engagements coalesce

into one great battle.

5. Only in a great battle does the commander-in-chief control operations

in person; it is only natural that he should prefer to entrust the direction
of the battle to himself.

destruction of the enemy’s forces is generally accomplished by means of
great battles and their results; and, the primary object of great battles must
be the destruction of the enemy’s forces.

No doubt the principle of destruction is also present to greater or lesser

extent in other types of action. Certainly there have been minor
engagements (such as Maxen) in which favorable circumstances have
resulted in the destruction of a disproportionate number of enemy forces.
And on the other hand, the capture or defense of a single position may be so
crucial as to dominate a great battle. But in general it remains true that great
battles are fought only to destroy the enemy’s forces, and that the
destruction of these forces can be accomplished only by a major battle.

center of gravity of the entire conflict or campaign. Just as the focal point of
a concave mirror causes the sun’s rays to converge into a perfect image and
heats them to maximum intensity, so all forces and circumstances of war are
united and compressed to maximum effectiveness in the major battle.

in every campaign, indicates a belligerent’s intention to use this mass in a
major blow, either on his own initiative (as the attacker) or at the instigation
of the other side (as the defender). If major action fails to develop, it is
because outside factors have appeared, modifying and restraining the
original animosity, and weakening, altering, or halting any movement. Even
under general conditions of inactivity—so characteristic of many wars—the
possibility of a battle always remains a focus for both sides, a distant aim
toward which their courses of action can be directed. The more earnestly a
war is waged, the more it is charged with hatred and animosity, and the
more it becomes a struggle for mastery on both sides, the more all activity
will tend to erupt into bitter fighting, and the greater the importance that
will then attach to a great battle.

Wherever a great and positive goal exists, one that will seriously affect

the enemy, a great battle is not only the most natural but also the best means
of attaining it, as we shall later show in detail. As a rule, shrinking from a
major decision by evading such a battle carries its own punishment.

The attacking side is the one that has a positive purpose and is therefore

likely to regard the great battle as its own preferred means of action.
Without intending at this point to define the concepts of attack and defense
in any detail, we must add that even for the defender a battle is the only
effective means of sooner or later coming to grips with his situation and
solving his problem.

as mutual murder—its effect, as we shall see in the next chapter, is rather a
killing of the enemy’s spirit than of his men—it is always true that the
character of battle, like its name, is slaughter [Schlacht], and its price is
blood. As a human being the commander will recoil from it.

But the human spirit recoils even more from the idea of a decision

brought about by a single blow. Here all action is compressed into a single
point in time and space. Under these conditions a man may dimly feel that

his powers cannot be developed and brought to bear in so short a period,
that much would be gained if he could have more time even if there is no
reason to suppose that this would work in his favor. All this is sheer
illusion, yet not to be dismissed on that account. The very weakness that
assails anyone who has to make an important decision may affect even
more strongly a military commander who is called upon to decide a matter
of such far-reaching consequences by a single blow.

That is why governments and commanders have always tried to find

ways of avoiding a decisive battle and of reaching their goal by other means
or of quietly abandoning it. Historians and theorists have taken great pains,
when describing such campaigns and conflicts, to point out that other
means not only served the purpose as well as a battle that was never fought,
but were indeed evidence of higher skill. This line of thought had brought
us almost to the point of regarding, in the economy of war, battle as a kind
of evil brought about by mistake—a morbid manifestation to which an
orthodox, correctly managed war should never have to resort. Laurels were
to be reserved for those generals who knew how to conduct a war without
bloodshed; and it was to be the specific purpose of the theory of war to
teach this kind of warfare.

be certain that it will not recur here or there for shorter or longer periods,
betray those responsible into mistakes which, because they cater to
weakness, cater to human nature. It is quite possible that at some time in the
future, Bonaparte’s campaigns and battles will be considered brutalities,
almost blunders, while the old-fashioned dress sword of antiquated and
desiccated manners and institutions will be relied upon and praised. If the
theorist can point out the dangers of this attitude, he will have provided an
essential service to those who care to listen. We hope we may be able to do
this for those in our beloved country who occupy positions of influence;
serving them as guides and calling on them to subject these matters to
profound study.

Our conviction that only a great battle can produce a major decision is

founded not on an abstract concept of war alone, but also on experience.
Since time began, only great victories have paved the way for great results;
certainly for the attacking side, and to some degree also for the defense. The
surrender at Ulm was a unique event, which would not have happened even

to Bonaparte if he had not been willing to shed blood. It must in fact be
looked upon as the aftermath of the victories that he had won in earlier
campaigns. All fortunate generals, and not only the bold, the daring, and the
stubborn, seek to crown their achievements by risking everything in
decisive battles. Their answer to this transcendental question, then, should
be enough for us.

The fact that slaughter is a horrifying spectacle must make us take war more
seriously, but not provide an excuse for gradually blunting our swords in the
name of humanity. Sooner or later someone will come along with a sharp
sword and hack off our arms.

campaign, but not necessarily as the only one. Campaigns whose outcome
have been determined by a single battle have become fairly common only
in recent times, and those cases in which they have settled an entire war are
very rare exceptions.

depend entirely on the battle itself—that is, the scale of the forces engaged
or the intensity of the victory. It depends also on countless other factors that
affect the war potential of each side and the belligerent states. But by
committing the major part of their available strength to this gigantic duel,
both sides initiate a major decision. In some respects its scope can be
predicted, but not in all. It may not be the only decision, but it is the first,
and as such will affect all those that follow. Therefore, the purpose of a
great battle is to act—more or less according to circumstances, but always
to some extent—as the provisional center of gravity of the entire campaign.
A commander who enters each battle with the true military spirit—the faith,
the feeling, in short the conviction that he must and will defeat his enemy—
will most likely try to tip the scales of the first battle with everything he
has, hoping and striving to win everything. We doubt whether Bonaparte in
any of his campaigns ever took the field without the idea of crushing the
enemy in the very first encounter. Frederick the Great, in more limited
circumstances and with less scope, had the same idea whenever at the head
of his small force, he tried to fend off the Russians or the Imperial armies.

To repeat: the decision that is brought about by the battle partly depends

partly on the magnitude of the success.

What a commander can do to heighten the significance of the battle in the

first respect is quite obvious; we only wish to point out that, as the scale of
the battle grows, so does the number of additional circumstances that are
decided by it. Therefore, commanders with enough self-confidence to go
for great decisions have always managed to deploy the great bulk of their
forces in a great battle without seriously neglecting other areas.

four factors:

1. On the tactical pattern according to which the battle is fought
2. On the terrain
3. On the composition of the forces
4. On the relative strength of the opposing armies.
 
A battle fought with parallel fronts and without an enveloping action is

not so likely to bring great results as one in which the defeated army has
been turned, or made to change its front to greater or lesser degree. In rough
or hilly country the impact is weakened, and therefore the results will also
be less.

If the loser’s cavalry is equal to or stronger than that of the victor, the

effects of pursuit are lost, and with them some important results of the
victory.

Finally, it must be obvious that the effect of a victory will be greater in

cases where the victor is numerically superior and has used his superiority
to turn the enemy’s flank or make him change his front than in those in
which the victor was the weaker party. To be sure, the battle of Leuthen
might cause some doubt about the practical soundness of this principle, but
we hope we may for once use a phrase we normally avoid: there is an
exception to every rule.

A general can use all these means to make a battle decisive. Of course,

they carry their own risks; but all his actions are subject to this dynamic law
of the moral world.

There is then no factor in war that rivals the battle in importance; and the

greatest strategic skill will be displayed in creating the right conditions for

it, choosing the right place, time and line of advance, and making the fullest
use of its results.

complex and obscure. Far from it: everything is quite simple, and needs
only moderate skill in planning. The great requirements are the gifts of
quickly sizing up a situation, of vigor, persistency, and a youthful,
enterprising spirit—all of them heroic qualities to which we shall have to
refer again. Clearly, most of these are not qualities that can be acquired
through book learning. If they can be taught at all, a general will have to
receive his instruction from sources other than the printed word.

toward it, must emanate from a sense of one’s own powers and the absolute
conviction of necessity—in other words, from innate courage and
perception, sharpened by experience of responsibility.

Apt examples are the best teachers, but one must never let a cloud of

preconceived ideas get in the way; for even the rays of the sun are refracted
and diffused by clouds. It is the theorist’s most urgent task to dissipate such
preconceptions which at times form and infiltrate like a miasma. The errors
intellect creates, intellect can again destroy.

what the actual purpose of a battle may be, how it fits into the general
pattern of the war, to what extent conditions may allow a victory to run its
course, and at what point it reaches its culmination. Meanwhile, what
remains true under all imaginable conditions is that no victory will be
effective without pursuit; and no matter how brief the exploitation of
victory, it must always go further than an immediate follow-up. Rather than
repeat that fact at every opportunity, we will spend a moment on it now.

Pursuit of a beaten enemy begins the moment he concedes the fight and

abandons his position. Previous movement either way has nothing to do
with this—that is part of the development of the battle itself. At this
juncture victory, while assured, is usually still limited and modest in its
dimensions. Little positive advantage would be gained in the normal course
of events unless victory were consummated by pursuit on the first day. It is
usually only then, as we have said, that the trophies tend to be taken which
will embody the victory. We shall discuss this phase first.

Normally both sides are already physically tired when they go into battle,

since the movements directly preceding an engagement are usually of a
very strenuous kind. A prolonged struggle on the battlefield calls for
exertions that complete the exhaustion. Moreover the winning side is in
almost as much disorder and confusion as the losers, and will, therefore,
have to pause so that order can be restored, stragglers collected, and
ammunition distributed. For the victor, these conditions create the critical
phase that has already been mentioned. If the defeated troops are only a
minor part of the enemy’s forces and have other units to fall back on or can

look to strong reinforcements to arrive, the victor may easily run the risk of
losing his gains at any moment. This consideration will cut short the pursuit
or at least keep it within very narrow bounds. But even without any risk of
the enemy being reinforced, the circumstances already described will
counterbalance the victor’s elasticity in pursuit. Though the victory itself is
not in danger, reverses are possible that may reduce the advantage. At this
point, too, a general’s freedom of action bears a heavy handicap—the whole
weight of human needs and weaknesses. Each of the thousands under his
command needs food and rest, and longs for nothing so much as a few
hours free of danger and fatigue. Very few men—and they are the
exceptions—are able to follow and feel beyond the present moment. Only
these few, having accomplished the urgent task at hand, are left with enough
mental energy to think of making further gains—gains which at such a time
may seem trifling embellishments of victory, indeed an extravagance. The
voice of the other thousands, however, is what is heard in the general’s
council; it is conducted up a channel of senior officers who urge these
human needs on the general’s sympathy. The general’s own energies have
been sapped by mental and physical exertion, and so it happens that for
purely human reasons less is achieved than was possible. What does get
accomplished is due to the supreme commander’s ambition, energy, and
quite possibly his callousness. Only thus can we explain the timorous way
in which so many generals exploit a victory that has given them the upper
hand. The “immediate pursuit” after a victory is a term we would as a rule
only apply to pursuit on the very same day, including at most the following
night. Beyond that point, the pursuer’s own need for rest will in any case
call a halt.

There are various degrees of immediate pursuit, according to its nature.
The first is pursuit by cavalry alone. This usually amounts more to

keeping the enemy under surveillance and in a state of alarm than to the
application of serious pressure, since it can easily be disrupted by the
slightest natural obstacle. Cavalry may be effective against isolated units of
demoralized and weak troops, but if faced with the enemy’s main force, it
can only act as an auxiliary arm. The enemy’s fresh reserves can cover his
retreat, and at the first insignificant natural obstacle can unite all arms and
make an effective stand. The only exception is an army actually in flight
and on the way to total dissolution.

arms, including of course the bulk of the cavalry. This kind of pursuit
presses the enemy until he reaches a place where his rear guard can take a
strong stand, or until his whole army can take up a new position. Since
there is not likely to be an immediate opportunity for either, the pursuit
reaches farther. It will, however, not last longer than an hour or a few hours
at most; otherwise the vanguard may tend to lose contact with its support.

advancing so long as its strength holds out. In that event the merest threat of
an attack or of a flank being turned will cause the beaten force to abandon
most positions that the terrain might afford. Also its rear guard will be less
likely to get involved in stiff delaying actions.

considered closed. The rare exceptions in which pursuit is carried on
throughout the night must rank as unusually intensified.

left to chance, and that regular formation and routine have vanished anyway
by the time the fighting ends, one can well understand that both
commanders will shrink from the idea of continuing operations in the dark.
Unless success is assured by the loser’s complete disarray, or by the
victorious army’s exceptional military virtues, everything will be left very
much to fate, and no commander, not even the most audacious, will find
this to his liking. As a rule, then, night puts an end to pursuit, even if the
decision has taken place only a short time before it grew dark. Night affords
the loser either the immediate opportunity to rest and reassemble, or a
headstart if he chooses to continue the retreat under cover of darkness.

After such a break, the loser will no doubt find his situation to have

improved considerably. A substantial part of the confusion has been sorted
out, fresh ammunition has been issued, and the force as a whole has been
reorganized. Any further encounters with the victor will constitute a new
engagement rather than a continuation of the old; and while it does not by
any means hold out promise of absolute success, at least it is a fresh start
and not just a mopping-up operation on the part of the victor.

even if only with a strong advance guard of all arms—the effects of the

victory will be on a vastly greater scale. The battles of Leuthen and Belle-
Alliance provide examples.

order to clarify in our own minds the difference it can make in the effect of
a victory.

hardly bears any relation to his further plans and situation. These may
considerably diminish the success of a major victory, but they cannot
prevent this immediate exploitation. Even if one can conceive of such cases,
they would be so rare that they could not significantly influence theory.

a whole new field of energy. In earlier wars, smaller in scope and more
narrowly circumscribed, conventions had developed that unnecessarily
restricted many aspects of operations and this one in particular. The very
idea, the honor of victory, appeared to be the whole point so far as the
commanders were concerned. Actual destruction of enemy forces was to
them only one of many means of war—certainly not the main, even less the
only one. They were only too ready to sheathe their swords as soon as the
enemy lowered his. Once a decision had been reached, one stopped fighting
as a matter of course: further bloodshed was considered unnecessarily
brutal.

did, however, express an attitude that assured a ready hearing and attached
much weight to the plea of general exhaustion and the physical
impossibility of continuing the battle. Admittedly, it is only natural to spare
one’s victorious troops where no others are available, the more so if one
expects that the tasks ahead will pretty soon be more than they can cope
with, as they often are when an offensive is maintained. But this kind of
reasoning was incorrect: clearly, any further losses caused by a continued
pursuit would be proportionately a great deal smaller than those the enemy
would suffer. Only where the fighting forces were not considered to be the
vital factor could the former view possibly originate. In earlier wars,
accordingly, one finds that only the greatest heroes—Charles XII,
Marlborough, Prince Eugene, Frederick the Great—would drive home a
victory already decisive enough by vigorous pursuit. Other generals as a
rule were content to remain in possession of the field. Contemporary war,

which is waged with increased vigor in response to the increased scope of
circumstances, has broken these conventional bounds: pursuit is now one of
the victor’s main concerns, and the trophies are thus substantially increased.
Even if there are instances among more recent battles where this has not
happened, these were exceptions, and unusual factors were always at work.

only by the superior allied cavalry; at Grossbeeren and Dennewitz, by pique
on the part of the Crown Prince of Sweden; and at Laon, by Blücher’s age
and poor state of health.

Borodino also offers a relevant example, and we cannot refrain from

saying more about it—partly because we do not think the matter can be
settled just by blaming Bonaparte, and partly because it might appear that
this case, along with a considerable number of similar ones, may possibly
be placed in that category which we have considered as extremely rare,
when from the very start of the battle the commander was bound hand and
foot by his general situation.

and great admirers of his (Vaudoncourt, Chambray, Ségur) for failing to
drive the Russian army off the field or to use his last remaining strength to
crush it. They argue that what was merely a lost battle could have been an
absolute rout. We should be led too far afield if we gave a detailed picture
of the relative situations of both armies. But so much is clear: that when
Bonaparte crossed the Niemen he had 300,000 men in those corps that
would participate in the battle at Borodino; now only 120,000 were left, and
he may well have wondered if he had enough to march on Moscow—and it
was on Moscow that everything appeared to hinge. The victory he had just
won made him reasonably confident of taking the capital; it seemed
exceedingly unlikely that the Russians could fight another battle within a
week; and it was in Moscow that he hoped to make peace. Admittedly, he
could have been more sure of making peace if the Russian army had been
completely destroyed; but his first priority was still to get to Moscow, and
to get there in enough strength to be in a position to enforce his will on the
capital, and thereby on the government and the Russian Empire.

As it turned out, the force that eventually reached Moscow was

inadequate to this task. But it would have been even less adequate if, in the
course of smashing the Russian army, Napoleon had also destroyed his

own. He was thoroughly conscious of this fact, and, to our mind, was
entirely justified. In spite of this, we must not count it among those cases in
which the general situation obliged the commander to refrain from
following up his victory by an immediate pursuit. In fact there was never
any question of pursuit as such. The battle was decided about 4 P.M.; but
the Russians still held most of the battlefield, and had as yet no intention of
withdrawing. What is more, they would have met a renewed attack with
stubborn resistance; and this, while leading them to certain disaster, would
also have inflicted heavy additional losses on the French. The battle of
Borodino, like that of Bautzen, is therefore among those that were never
completely fought out. At Bautzen, the defeated party chose to leave the
battlefield early; at Borodino, the victor chose to content himself with only
a partial victory—not because he thought the issue was still in doubt, but
because a total victory would have cost him more than he was able to pay.

lead us to the following conclusion: the importance of the victory is chiefly
determined by the vigor with which the immediate pursuit is carried out. In
other words, pursuit makes up the second act of the victory and in many
cases is more important than the first. Strategy at this point draws near to
tactics in order to receive the completed assignment from it; and its first
exercise of authority is to demand that the victory should really be
complete.

pursuit: it is only the beginning of the actual course of events for which
victory has provided the momentum. As we have stated previously, this
course of events will be influenced by other factors which are not yet under
discussion. But we will now go on to examine the more general aspects of
pursuit in order to avoid repetition later.

In the continuation of the pursuit we can again distinguish three

gradations. The first consists in merely following the enemy; the second in
exerting pressure on him; and the third in a parallel march to cut him off.

ready for another engagement. In other words, this kind of pursuit would
suffice to exhaust the effect of the superiority gained in the battle. In
addition, the victor will capture everything the loser cannot take with him:
sick and wounded, stragglers, baggage, and wagons of all kinds. In itself,

however, merely following the enemy will not accelerate the break-up of
his forces, while pressure and parallel marches will.

satisfied with merely following the enemy to his previous position and
occupying as much of the terrain as he is willing to cede. Instead, we
arrange at each stage to demand something more: our leading units are
geared to attack his rear guard every time it tries to take up a position,
thereby speeding up the enemy’s retreat and promoting his disintegration.
This is so mainly because his retreat has to take the form of continuous,
uninterrupted flight. Nothing is more repugnant to a soldier than hearing the
enemy’s guns yet again just as he is settling down to rest after a strenuous
march. This sensation, repeated day after day, can lead to absolute panic. As
a constant recognition of the fact that the enemy has the upper hand and that
resistance is beyond one’s capability, it is bound to be extremely damaging
to the troops’ morale. The pressure is worst when it forces the retreating
army into night marches. If at sunset the victor drives his enemy from the
campsite he has chosen either for his whole army or for his rear guard, the
defeated army will have to march by night or at least shift its position and
retreat still further—it comes to much the same. Meanwhile, the victorious
army passes an undisturbed night.

as elsewhere, on a great variety of factors: supplies particularly, outstanding
features of the terrain, large towns, and so forth. It would therefore be arrant
pedantry to demonstrate by geometrical analysis how the pursuer, having
the upper hand, can keep the retreating army marching night after night
while his own men are resting. But it remains a fact, and a useful one, that
pursuit so planned may have such a tendency, and will thereby become
immensely more effective. The reason it is seldom put into practice is that
the pursuing army itself would find such a procedure more difficult than
keeping regular hours and stopping at the usual time of day. It is far easier
to break camp early in the morning, occupy the next at noon, spend the rest
of the day in resupplying, and sleep at night than to base your moves
exactly on the enemy’s, take all decisions at short notice, break camp at
dawn one day and dusk the next; always facing the enemy for hours at a
time, trading shot for shot with him, skirmishing, planning to turn his flank;
in short, deploying every artifice of tactics which the situation demands.

This obviously places a heavy burden on the pursuer, and war brings so
many burdens that it is only human to eliminate any that appear at all
avoidable. These considerations are valid whether they apply to the whole
army or, as is more usual, to a strong vanguard. The above reasons account
for the relative rarity of this type of pursuit—the application of constant
pressure on the defeated army. Even Bonaparte made little use of it in his
Russian campaign of 1812. The reason is obvious: the difficulties and
hardships of this campaign were already enough to threaten his army with
complete disaster before he had reached his goal. But in other campaigns
the French have distinguished themselves by their energy in this respect as
well.

marching parallel with the enemy toward the immediate goal of his retreat.

which it is most anxious to reach. Possibly it poses a threat to its further
retreat, such as a defile; or it may be essential to reach this objective before
the enemy because it is a major city, a supply base, or something of the
kind; or, finally, it may be a point where the army expects to gain new
powers of resistance, as in the case of a strong position, a junction with
additional forces, and so forth.

obviously make the enemy increase the speed of his retreat at heavy cost; he
can make it a scramble and finally a stampede. Only three ways of meeting
this are open to the beaten force. The first is to turn upon the enemy, and
try, by means of a surprise attack, to create a turn for the better which the
situation does not really afford. Obviously this requires a bold and
enterprising commander and first-rate troops—beaten, perhaps, but far from
being utterly defeated. A retreating army is therefore seldom able to make
use of this stratagem.

The second way is to speed up the retreat. But that is just what the victor

wants. It is likely to exhaust the troops and result in stragglers by the score,
guns and transport rendered unserviceable, and consequently will cause
enormous losses.

enemy will involve less exertion, and will prevent haste from causing

further loss. This is the worst way of all. It may be compared to additional
debts incurred by a bankrupt, and usually leads to still greater
embarrassment. There may, indeed, be cases where this course is advisable,
and others where it is the only way out. There may even be cases where it
worked. Generally, however, it is certainly chosen not so much from the
conviction that it is the best way to reach one’s objective safely, but from
another, less creditable motive: fear of closing with the enemy. Woe to the
general who succumbs to such fear! No matter how low the morale of the
troops, how justified the apprehension of being at a disadvantage in an
encounter with the enemy, the situation will only be aggravated by timidly
shirking every opportunity of contact. Bonaparte would never have been
able to return across the Rhine in 1813 with even the thirty to forty
thousand men still left to him after the battle of Hanau if he had refused a
battle there and tried to cross at Mannheim or Coblenz. Such minor
engagements, carefully prepared and carried out, in which the defeated
army, being on the defensive, is able to reap the benefit of the terrain, are
the very means of starting a recovery in the morale of the troops.

Even a minor success can do wonders. Still, most generals have to

overcome great reluctance to make the attempt. At first sight evasion seems
so much easier that it is usually preferred. This very evasion often furthers
the purpose of the victor more than anything, and frequently ends in the
total destruction of the defeated force. Of course we are speaking of an
army as a whole, not of a part that has been cut off and is trying to rejoin
the rest by a detour. The latter constitutes a different situation, and success
in such a case is not unlikely. But there is a condition attached to this race
for a given objective: part of the victor’s force must follow the retreating
army on the road it has taken, mopping up everything it leaves behind, and
to impress the pursued force with its presence. Blücher, whose pursuit after
Belle Alliance was a model in all other respects, missed this point.

advisable when the enemy can fall back on another (sizeable) force, where a
first-rate general is in command of the enemy forces, and their destruction
is not already well under way. However, where one can afford to use this
means, it works like an efficient machine. The beaten army’s loss from
sickness and fatigue is grossly disproportionate, and its whole morale is
weakened and depressed by constant fear of imminent disaster, until, in the

end, organized resistance is inconceivable. Thousands of prisoners are taken
every day without a blow being struck. At such a time of good fortune, the
victor must not be afraid to divide his forces in order to envelop everything
within reach of his army, isolate outlying units, take fortresses that are
caught off guard, occupy large towns, and so forth. He may do whatever he
wants until the situation changes; the more liberties he takes, the later that
moment will come.

first-rate pursuits in the Napoleonic Wars. It should be enough to recall the
battles of Jena, Regensburg, Leipzig, and Belle-Alliance.

In order to utilize any weakness or mistake on the part of the enemy, not

giving an inch more ground than the force of circumstances requires, and
especially in order to keep morale as high as possible, it is absolutely
necessary to make a slow fighting retreat, boldly confronting the pursuer
whenever he tries to make too much of his advantage. The retreats of great
commanders and experienced armies are always like the retreat of a
wounded lion, and this unquestionably is theoretically preferable as well.

When a dangerous position has to be abandoned, time is often wasted on

trivial formalities, thereby compounding the danger. In such a case,
everything depends on getting away as quickly as possible. Experienced
commanders consider this to be very important. But it should not be
confused with a general retreat. Anyone who then believes that a few forced
marches will give him a good start and help him make a stand is
dangerously wrong. The first movements have to be almost imperceptibly

short, and it must be a general principle not to let the enemy impose his
will. This principle cannot be put into practice without fighting fierce
engagements with the pursuing enemy, but it is a principle worth the cost.
Otherwise the pace is bound to increase till withdrawal turns into rout.
More men will be lost as stragglers than would have been lost in rear guard
actions. And the last vestiges of courage will have disappeared.

of a number of factors: a strong rear guard, made up of the best troops, led
by the most courageous general, and supported at crucial moments by the
rest of the army; skillful use of the terrain; strong ambushes wherever the
daring of the enemy’s vanguard and the terrain permit. In short, it consists
of planning and initiating regular small-scale engagements.

whether the battle was fought on favorable terms and on the severity of the
fighting. Jena and Belle-Alliance show that any sort of regular retreat
becomes impossible if one fights to the last against a superior foe.

that the retreating forces should be divided; they should withdraw in
separate columns, or even by divergent routes. It must be clear that we are
not here discussing a separation simply for convenience of march, in which
the option and the intention of fighting in concert are retained. Any other
kind of separation is extremely dangerous; it goes against the grain, and
would be a great mistake. A lost battle always tends to have an enfeebling,
disintegrating effect; the immediate need is to reassemble, and to recover
order, courage, and confidence in the concentration of troops. It is absurd to
think that an enemy, at the moment he is following up his victory, can be
harassed on both his flanks by a divided force. This may possibly impress
an opposing general who is nothing but a timid pedant, and in such a case
one can try it. But unless one can be sure of this kind of weakness, it would
be better not to try. Where the strategic situation after the battle requires that
one’s flanks be covered by separate detachments, it will have to be done to
the most limited extent possible. But such a separation must always be
regarded as a drawback, and one is usually in no position to effect it on the
day after the battle.

free will, but because the position of his forces and the need to cover
Saxony left him no alternative. Bonaparte, after the battle of Brienne,
ordered Marmont back to the Aube while he crossed the Seine and turned
toward Troyes. This did not end in disaster only because the allies, instead
of following him, also divided their forces: one part under Bliicher headed
for the Marne while the other under Schwarzenberg, fearing itself to be too
weak, advanced extremely slowly.

Basically, a night attack is only an intensified raid. At first glance it looks

highly effective: supposedly the defender is taken unawares, while the
attacker, of course, is well prepared for what is about to happen. What an
uneven contest! One imagines complete confusion on one side, and on the
other an attacker concerned merely to profit by it. This image explains the
many schemes for night attacks put forward by those who have neither to
lead them nor accept responsibility for them. In practice they are very rare.

All such ideas assume that the attacker knows the complete layout of the

defense, which, having been previously planned and carried out, could not
escape his reconnaissance and intelligence. On the other hand, the attacker’s
dispositions, made only at the moment of execution, must remain unknown
to the other side. But even the latter does not always happen, and the former
is even less common. Unless the enemy is so close as to be in full view (as
Frederick the Great was to the Austrians before the battle of Hochkirch)
knowledge of his position will be incomplete. It will be acquired from
reconnaissance, patrols, prisoners’ statements and spies, and it can never
really be reliable for the simple reason that all such reports are always a
little out of date, and the enemy may in the meantime have changed his
position. Moreover with the old system of tactics and encampment it was
far easier to find out the position of the enemy than it is today. A line of
tents is more easily distinguished than a collection of huts, much less a
bivouac; and a line of battle deployed in linear formation can be
distinguished more easily than one consisting of divisions in column, as is
now the rule. It is possible to have a perfect view of the area in which a

division is encamped in such a manner, and still not be able to form a clear
picture of its layout.

important to know the dispositions that he will take in the course of the
action. After all, he will not just shoot his guns off blindly. Since these
tactical decisions have come to be more important than the initial positions,
night raids have become more difficult to carry out in war today than they
were formerly. Nowadays a defender can station his troops with more
flexibility, and contemporary warfare thus enables him to surprise the
enemy with unexpected blows.

In a night operation, then, the attacker seldom if ever knows enough

about the defense to make up for his lack of visual observation.

better known to him than it is to the attacker, in the same way as a man can
find his way around his own room in the dark more easily than can a
stranger. He can find and round up all the component parts of his forces
more quickly than can his assailant.

It follows from all this that the attacker needs his eyes in night operations

just as much as does the defense. Therefore special reasons are needed to
justify a night attack.

army as a whole. It follows that night raids will as a rule occur in minor
engagements, and seldom in major battles.

A subordinate part of the enemy’s force can easily be attacked and

surrounded in superior strength. One can either capture it intact, or inflict
severe loss on it by forcing it to fight against heavy odds—provided all
other conditions are favorable. But this type of plan can only be carried out
as a complete surprise. No part of the enemy’s force would ever be willing
to fight on such unequal terms; it would more likely withdraw. The element
of surprise in turn can, with the rare exceptions of thickly wooded areas,
only be present with the help of darkness. So if one wants to take this type
of advantage of an enemy unit’s weak position, one must make use of night,
at least for the completion of one’s preparations, even if the actual
engagement will not take place much before dawn. This accounts for all the
minor night operations against outposts and other minor units. Essentially
they are meant, by superiority and envelopment, to involve the

unsuspecting enemy in an engagement on such unequal terms that he cannot
escape without heavy loss.

larger force has great internal resources and can keep on fighting until help
arrives.

That is why under ordinary circumstances this kind of attack cannot be

used against the whole of the enemy’s force. While an entire army cannot
expect outside aid, its own resources are sufficient to ward off an attack
from several sides, especially nowadays when such attacks are so common
that everyone is trained to deal with them. The success of an enveloping
attack usually depends on factors that have nothing to do with surprise. We
need not go into them here; it is enough to say that while envelopment can
offer great rewards, it can also involve great risks. So except in special
circumstances, it can be justified only by great superiority, such as can, of
course, be concentrated on a subordinate part of an army.

of night, is a more feasible operation for another reason. The troops detailed
for the task, no matter how superior, will in all probability constitute only a
fraction of the total strength; and it is safer to gamble only a part on a risky
operation than the whole of the army. And the risks themselves are reduced
still further by the fact that the assault force will be covered and supported
by a larger force, or even by the whole army.

Night operations are not merely risky; they are also difficult to execute.

This too limits their scale. Their essence being surprise, it must be a prime
consideration to approach without being seen. This, too, is easier for small
detachments than for large ones, and rarely feasible for the columns of an
entire army. Hence operations of this kind are generally aimed at single
outposts. They can be used against a larger corps only if its outposts are
inadequate, as was the case of Frederick the Great at Hochkirch. Such
conditions are in turn less likely to obtain in the case of a whole army than
in that of its subsidiary parts.

armies have at times had to camp very near each other, and without a strong
system of outposts. This always coincides with the critical stages that
usually precede a decision. At that stage, however, both armies are in a
greater state of readiness for action. In earlier wars, on the other hand, the

practice was often for armies to camp in full view of each other, even when
all they aimed at was to hold each other in check—and this could last for
some time. For weeks on end Frederick the Great would camp so near the
Austrians that both sides could have exchanged cannon shots.

abandoned in more recent wars. Armies nowadays are no longer
independent organisms, self-sufficient in matters of supply and
encampment: as a rule they think it wise to leave a full day’s march
between the enemy and themselves.

evident that adequate reasons for this type of operation are unusual. They
may be traced to the following causes:

1. Exceptional carelessness or provocation on the part of the enemy. This

is infrequent. Where it does occur it is usually balanced by decidedly
superior morale.

2. A wave of panic in the enemy army, or, in general, a case in which the

attacker’s morale is so superior as to be able to supply the place of
guidance in action.

3. Fighting one’s way through a superior enemy force by which one is

surrounded. In this case, the element of surprise is crucial; the single
aim—escape—permits a far greater concentration of forces.

4. Finally, desperate situations in which one’s troops are so heavily

outnumbered that only the utmost daring offers any prospect of
success.

 
It must be remembered that all these cases only hold good on condition

that the enemy army is in full view, and not covered by a vanguard.

Most night operations, incidentally, are planned to end at daybreak,

darkness being used to cover only the approach and the first assault. This
enables the attacker to make better use of the confusion into which he
throws the enemy. Engagements that do not start till dawn, and in which
darkness is used merely for the approach, are not true night operations at
all.

1. THEATER OF OPERATIONS

OceanofPDF.com

2. THE ARMY

In establishing the meaning of the term the army’s actual strength matters

less than one might at first suppose. Where several armies operate in a
single theater under a combined command, the term does not derive from
their numbers but from their previous history. (In 1813, for example, there
were the Silesian Army, the Army of the North, and so forth.) Large
numbers of men that are destined to remain in a given theater of operations
will certainly be formed into different corps, but never into separate armies.
That, at any rate, is not the term that would be used, and usage seems to
stick closely to practice. On the other hand it would be sheer pedantry to
claim the term “army” for every band of partisans that operates on its own
in a remote part of the country. Still, we must admit that no one thinks it
odd to talk of the “army” of the Vendee during the French Revolutionary
Wars, though it was frequently little more than a band of partisans. The
terms “army” and “theater of operations,” then, normally go hand in hand,
each confirming the other.

becoming more decisive with each passing day. The principle of bringing
the maximum possible strength to the decisive engagement must therefore
rank rather higher than it did in the past.

The courage and morale of an army have always increased its physical

strength, and always will. But there are periods in history when great
psychological advantage was gained by superior organization and
equipment; others where the same result was achieved by superior mobility.
Sometimes it was a matter of novel tactics; at other times the art of war
revolved around efforts to exploit terrain skillfully on large and
comprehensive lines. On occasion generals have managed to gain great
advantages over one another bv such means. But efforts of this type have
declined, making way for simpler and more natural procedures. If we take
an unbiased look at the experiences of the recent wars, we must admit that
those means have almost disappeared, both from the campaign as a whole
and the decisive engagements, and particularly from the major battle—as
already explained in Chapter Two of the previous book.

Today armies are so much alike in weapons, training, and equipment that

there is little difference in such matters between the best and the worst of
them. Education may still make a considerable difference between technical
corps, but what it usually comes down to is that one side invents
improvements and first puts them to use, and the other side promptly copies
them. Even the senior generals—divisional and corps commanders—have,

as far as their efficacy is concerned, pretty much the same views and
methods. The only remaining factor that can produce marked superiority,
aside from familiarity with war, consists of the talents of the commander-in-
chief, which hardly bear a constant relationship to the cultural standards of
the people and the army, and are, indeed, completely left to chance. The
decisive importance of relative strength increases the closer we approach a
state of balance in all the above factors.

battle of Borodino, objectively studied, pitted the French army, the finest in
the world, against the Russian army, which, in much of its organization and
individual training, was probably the least advanced. In the whole of the
battle, there was not a trace of superior skill or intelligence: it was simply a
test of strength, and in this the two armies were almost equal. What ensued
in the end was merely a slight tipping of the balance in favor of the side that
was led with greater vigor and was more familiar with war. We choose
Borodino as an illustration since it is a rare example of almost equal
numbers being involved.

We do not contend that all battles are like that, but it is typical of most of

them.

numbers are bound to make a favorable outcome more certain. In fact in
modern war one will search in vain for a battle in which the winning side
triumphed over an army twice its size. In earlier days this happened now
and then. With the sole exception of Dresden in 1813, Bonaparte, the
greatest general of modern times, always managed to assemble a
numerically superior, or at least not markedly inferior, army for all the
major battles in which he was victorious; and where he failed to do so—as
at Leipzig, Brienne, Laon, and Belle-Alliance—he lost.

general cannot change. Yet it does not follow that war is impossible for an
army whose strength is markedly inferior. War is not always the result of a
voluntary policy decision—least of all in instances where there is a great
disproportion of forces. So one must admit any kind of relative strength: it
would be a peculiar theory of war if it broke off just where the need for it
was greatest.

absolute limits can be set.

further, the more restricted the strength, the more limited the duration.
These two directions afford escape routes, so to speak, for the weaker side.
Any changes in the conduct of the war that are brought about by the degree
of strength can be discussed only in their turn; it is enough at this stage to
indicate the overall point of view. But for the sake of completeness one
more point must be added.

Where the opposite occurs, and despair engenders dejection instead of
heroism, the art of war has, of course, come to an end.

result is that combination of brilliant strokes and cautious restraint that we
admire in the campaigns of Frederick the Great.

dominance of vigor and tension. Where the disparity of strength is so
overwhelming that no limitation of one’s objectives will provide protection
from failure, or where the period of danger threatens to be so extended that
not even the greatest economy of strength can lead to success, the tension
will, or should, build up to one decisive blow. The hard-pressed army, not
expecting help where none can be forthcoming, can only trust to the high
morale that despair breeds in all courageous men. At that point the greatest
daring, possibly allied with a bold stratagem, will seem to be the greatest
wisdom. Where success is out of reach, an honorable defeat will at least
grant one the right to rise again in days to come.

We trust we may be forgiven the following analysis, which really belongs

more under the heading of tactics. It is needed here in the interest of clarity.

An engagement consists of two essentially different components: the

destructive power of firearms, and hand-to-hand, or individual, combat. The
latter in turn can be used for either attack or defense (words employed here
in an absolute sense, for we are speaking in the broadest terms). Artillery is
effective only through the destructive power of fire; cavalry only by way of
individual combat; infantry by both these means.

In hand-to-hand fighting, the essence of defense is to stand fast, as it

were, rooted to the ground; whereas movement is the essence of attack.
Cavalry is totally incapable of the former, but preeminent in the latter, so it
is suited only to attack. Infantry is best at standing fast, but does not lack
some capacity to move.

This distribution of elementary military strengths among the three main

arms demonstrates the superiority and versatility of infantry in comparison
with the other two: it alone combines all three qualities. This also explains
how in war a combination of the three arms leads to a more complete use of
all of them. It enables the combatant to reinforce at will any one of the
functions which, in the infantry, are inseparably united.

In recent wars the major role has undoubtedly been played by the

destructive power of firearms: but it is no less clear that the true, the actual
core of an engagement lies in the personal combat of man against man. An
army composed simply of artillery, therefore, would be absurd in war. An
army consisting simply of cavalry is conceivable, but would have little
strength in depth. An army consisting simply of infantry is not only

conceivable, but would be a great deal stronger. The degree of
independence of the three branches, then, is infantry, cavalry, artillery.

with the other two. Destruction being a more effective factor than mobility,
the complete absence of cavalry would prove to be less debilitating to an
army than the complete absence of artillery.

itself at a disadvantage when faced with one composed of all three arms.
But if it were to make up for the missing cavalry by a proportionately
stronger infantry force, a change in its tactical dispositions would enable it
to manage fairly well. Outposts would pose some difficulties: there could be
no brisk pursuit of a defeated enemy; and its own retreat would cause
greater hardships and exertions. But such difficulties alone would hardly be
sufficient to drive it off the field. If, on the other hand, such an army were
faced with one composed only of infantry and cavalry it would stand up
very well indeed. It is, in turn, almost inconceivable that the latter type
could hold out at all against an army composed of all three arms.

the services are derived from the whole mass of military data, where one
instance is analogous to another. It cannot be our intention to apply the facts
we have discovered to every single phase of any given engagement. A
battalion retreating or doing outpost duty would probably prefer some
cavalry to a few guns. A body of cavalry and horse artillery with the task of
pursuing a retreating enemy or cutting off his escape will find infantry
completely useless, and so forth.

Let us recapitulate the results of these reflections:

1. Infantry is the most independent of the arms.
2. Artillery has no independence.
3. When one or more arms are combined, infantry is the most important

of them.

4. Cavalry is the most easily dispensable arm.
5. A combination of all three confers the greatest strength.
 
Since maximum strength derives from a combination of all three arms,

the question naturally arises what the optimum proportions would be. An

answer is almost impossible.

If one could compare the cost of raising and maintaining the various arms

with the service each performs in time of war, one would end up with a
definite figure that would express the optimum equation in abstract terms.
But this is hardly more than a guessing game. The first part of the equation
alone is hard enough to estimate, except for the purely monetary factor; but
the value of human life is another matter—one on which no one would be
willing to set a price in cold figures.

There is also the fact that each arm really depends on a different sector of

the national economy: infantry on the human population, cavalry on the
equine, and artillery on finance. That fact introduces an outside
determinant, which we clearly see to be dominant in the general historical
phases of different peoples at different times.

But since for other reasons we cannot quite dispense with all standards of

comparison, instead of taking the first part of the equation as a whole, we
shall simply make use of the only ascertainable factor: the monetary cost.
For our purposes it will suffice to state that, according to common
experience, a squadron of 150 horses, a battalion of 800 men, and a battery
of eight six-pounders cost approximately the same both for equipment and
maintenance.

difficult to work out definite figures. It might conceivably be possible if
destructiveness were all that had to be measured; but each branch has its
own particular use and thus a different sphere of effective action. But the
spheres are by no means fixed; they could be expanded or contracted, and
the consequence would merely be to modify the conduct of the war without
incurring any special disadvantage.

People often talk of the lessons of experience in this context, in the belief

that the history of war provides sufficient grounds for a definite answer. But
those are obviously empty phrases, which, since they cannot be traced back
to any fundamental and compelling basis, are not worth considering in a
critical investigation.

In theory, then, there is an optimum proportion between the arms, which

in practice remains the unknown X, a mere figment of the imagination. But
it is possible to calculate what would happen if one arm were greatly
superior or inferior to the same arm on the other side.

Where it is absent, the total power of the army is significantly weakened.
On the other hand, it is the least mobile and so makes an army less flexible.
What is more, it must always be covered by infantry, since in itself it is
unable to engage in hand-to-hand combat. If there is too much artillery, and
the troops detailed to cover it are in consequence not strong enough at every
point to beat off the enemy, guns are easily lost. This points up an additional
disadvantage: artillery is the only one of the three arms whose main
equipment—guns and carriages—can be promptly used by the enemy
against its original owner.

it the rapid course of war is weakened, since everything proceeds more
slowly (on foot) and has to be organized more carefully. The rich harvest of
victory has to be reaped not with a scythe but with a sickle.

an army, an organic disproportion. But it does weaken the army indirectly,
because of the problems of maintenance and because we must recognize
that at the cost of an extra cavalry force of 10,000 men we could maintain
an additional 50,000 foot soldiers.

are the more relevant to the art of war in the narrower sense, since it is
concerned with the use of available forces. These are usually assigned to the
commander in proportion to their availability without his having much say
in the matter.

Assuming therefore that the character of war is modified by the

predominance of one of the arms, it will be in the following manner.

operations. Greater reliance will be placed on strong positions, major
natural obstacles, and even on positions in mountainous areas. The idea will
be to let terrain difficulties take care of the defense and protection of the
guns and to let the enemy court his own destruction. The whole war will
proceed at the solemn, formal tempo of a minuet.

Shortage of artillery will have the opposite effect. It will bring attack to

the fore—the active principle of movement. Marching, exertion and
continuous effort will become arms in themselves, and war will be a

brisker, rougher and more variegated business. Great events will be broken
down into small change.

movements preferred. With the enemy at a distance, we can enjoy greater
peace and comfort, without his being able to do the same. Since we are the
masters of space, we can be daring in the use of bold flanking movements
and generally more audacious maneuvers. Diversions and invasions, insofar
as they constitute valid expedients in war, are easily executed.

increasing its destructive powers as an excess of artillery does. The war will
then be marked by prudent and methodical proceedings. In such a case, the
natural tendencies are to stay close to the enemy so as to be able to keep an
eye on him; never to make a sudden, or worse, a hasty movement; always to
advance one’s forces gradually, keeping them well together; and to favor
defensive operations and those in rough country. If an attack is necessary, it
should be made on the enemy’s vital point by the shortest route.

These are the ways in which preponderance of one arm or another will

affect the operational conduct of a war; yet they are seldom so complete or
decisive that they play the only, or the principal, part in determining the
nature of the whole operation. Whether one selects the instrument of
strategic attack or of defense, one theater of operations or another, a major
battle or some other method of destruction, will probably depend on other,
weightier arguments. Where this is not so, we are afraid that nonessentials
have taken the place of essentials. But even in cases where the major issues
have already been decided on the basis of other reasons, a certain amount of
latitude remains in which preponderance in one branch can exert its
influence. It is possible to be prudent and methodical in attack, and bold and
enterprising in defense, and so on through every possible phase and nuance
of military activity.

Conversely, the nature of a war can greatly affect the proportions of the

arms of the service.

involve large numbers of infantry. This means a shortage of equipment
rather than of men, and equipment will be limited to the barest necessities.
It is therefore quite possible to raise not one, but two or three battalions for
every eight-gun battery.

is unable to resort to arming the people, or, what amounts to almost the
same thing, raising a militia, an increase in artillery is certainly the fastest
means of bolstering its forces and bringing about some sort of balance. One
can thereby save manpower while intensifying the principal element of the
forces, that is their destructive power. In any case such operations will
probably be limited to a small theater, for which artillery will also be most
appropriate. Frederick the Great relied on this means in the latter part of the
Seven Years War.

preponderance is important in operations over great distances, and in cases
where one expects to carry out major and decisive blows. Bonaparte will
serve as an example.

When we come to analyzing attack and defense, we shall see more

clearly that no direct influence is exercised by these two forms of warfare as
such. For the moment all we wish to point out is that, as a rule, both
attacker and defender will operate in the same terrain, and that, in at least a
great number of cases, their final intentions may be similar. The campaign
of 1812 is relevant here.

infantry was far higher than now, and has gradually declined ever since. To
some degree at least this is a misconception. On the average the proportion
of cavalry in absolute numbers was probably not significantly larger; and
one can easily confirm this by studying the actual figures for armed forces
throughout the Middle Ages. We need only mention the masses of foot
soldiers that made up the armies of the Crusaders or followed the German
Emperors into Italy. It was the importance of cavalry that was much greater.
Cavalry was the more effective arm, consisting of the elite; this made such a
difference that, although cavalry was always smaller by far, it was always
considered to be the decisive element; while foot soldiers were in low
esteem and hardly ever mentioned. Hence the idea that their numbers were
comparatively small. No doubt in some minor local incursions in Germany,
France, and Italy, a small force consisting of cavalry alone was more
common than it would be today; since it was the principal arm, this is not
inconsistent. But such cases are not conclusive when one considers the
general picture in which they are greatly outnumbered by cases in which

larger armies were involved. The custom of using large masses of relatively
inefficient foot soldiers came to an end only when the feudal system of
military service was replaced by that of hired mercenaries, and the conduct
of war became dependent on money and recruiting—as it did during the
Thirty Years War and the wars of Louis XIV. There might have been a
general return to cavalry at that time if developments in firearms had not
given fresh importance to the infantry. One effect was that infantry
remained superior in number to cavalry. Even when infantry was weak, its
ratio to cavalry during this period was one to one; when it was strong, the
ratio was three to one.

As firearms developed further, cavalry steadily continued to lose

importance. This is clear enough; but it must be understood that this
development related not only to the weapons as such, and to skill in using
them, but to the ability to employ troops thus equipped. At the battle of
Mollwitz, the Prussians had reached a level of perfection in the use of
firepower that has still not been surpassed. On the other hand, the
deployment of infantry in rough country and the use of firearms in
skirmishing developed only later, and must be considered a major advance
in destructive power.

In our view, then, the relationship of cavalry to infantry has changed little

in terms of numbers, but greatly in terms of importance. This may seem
self-contradictory, but in fact is not. In the armies of the Middle Ages we
find great masses of infantry, which, however, stood in no organic relation
to the cavalry; foot soldiers were plentiful merely because cavalry was so
expensive that all those who could not be equipped as cavalry automatically
became infantry. Infantry was therefore merely making the best of
necessity: if the quantity of cavalry had been determined only by its
intrinsic value, no amount of it would have been too much. This explains
why cavalry, though declining in importance, may still have enough
significance to maintain that proportion in the armed forces which it has
kept until our own times.

Succession, the ratio of cavalry to infantry has undergone no change at all
and has remained between one-quarter and one-sixth. This seems to indicate
that these proportions meet some natural need, thereby revealing a ratio that
cannot be directly ascertained. But we doubt if this is really so, and believe

that in all important instances other reasons are evident for maintaining
such large numbers of cavalry.

they still maintain fragments of Tartar institutions in their political
structures. Bonaparte could never be strong enough to suit his purpose:
once he had exhausted the use of conscription, the only means to strengthen
his army that remained open to him was to increase the auxiliary arms,
which called more for money than for men. Besides, it is plain that the
enormous extent of his military operations would place a greater emphasis
than usual on cavalry.

It is well known that Frederick the Great took pains to recruit not a single

man more than he reckoned his country could afford; his chief concern was
to maintain the strength of his army as far as possible at the expense of
other countries. It is easy to see that he had good reasons for this: his
limited territory at that time did not even include West Prussia or
Westphalia.

Cavalry not only required less manpower; it was also more easily

recruited. His method of warfare, too, was based entirely on superior
mobility. As a result while his infantry declined in numbers his cavalry kept
increasing right up to the end of the Seven Years War. Yet even then it
hardly amounted to more than a quarter of the infantry in the field.

field exceptionally short of cavalry and still being able to emerge victorious.
The outstanding case in point is the battle of Gross-Görschen. Counting
only the divisions that took part in the battle, Bonaparte had 100,000 men—
5,000 of them cavalry and 90,000 infantry. The allies had 70,000 men, of
whom 25,000 were cavalry and 40,000 infantry. Bonaparte’s cavalry was
thus 20,000 short, and he had only 50,000 more infantry than his
adversaries, when he ought to have had a superiority of 100,000. Since he
won the battle in spite of the smaller margin, one may well ask whether he
could possibly have lost it if he had had 140,000 infantry against the allies’
40,000.

After the battle, to be sure, the allied superiority in cavalry proved to be

most valuable: Bonaparte captured hardly any trophies. Victory alone is not
everything—but is it not, after all, what really counts?

infantry which was established eighty years ago and has persisted ever since
is the normal one, arising out of the intrinsic value of both arms. We are
more inclined to think that, after various fluctuations, the present tendency
will continue, and that the constant number of cavalry will eventually be
much lower than it is today.

reduced in weight, their number has naturally increased. Even so, since the
time of Frederick the Great, the proportionate strength of artillery has
remained fairly constant: two or three guns per thousand men—that is at the
outset of a campaign. In the course of operations guns are not lost as fast as
men, and so their proportion is a good deal higher by the end; possibly
arriving at a ratio of three, four or five guns per thousand men. Only
experience will determine whether these are the normal proportions, or
whether guns can go on being increased without encumbering the whole
conduct of war.

Let us now summarize the conclusions to which these arguments have

led:

1. Infantry is the main branch of the service; the other two are

supplementary.

2. A high degree of skill and vigor in the conduct of war can to some

extent make up for a lack of the supplementary branches—assuming
great numerical superiority in infantry. The higher the quality of the
infantry, the easier this will be.

3. It is harder to do without artillery than without cavalry: artillery is the

principal agent of destruction, and its use in action is more closely
coordinated with the infantry’s.

4. In general, artillery being the strongest agent of destruction and

cavalry the weakest, one is always confronted with the question of
how much artillery one can have without it being a disadvantage, and
with how little cavalry one can manage.

Thus in a sense the order of battle consists of an arithmetical and a

geometrical component: organization and disposition. The former emanates
from the army’s normal organization in peacetime; certain parts, such as
battalions, squadrons, regiments, and batteries, are treated as units that
serve as building-blocks for larger structures, which in turn form the whole,
depending on the requirements of the moment. Similarly, the army’s
disposition starts from the basic tactics in which it has been instructed and
trained in time of peace—characteristics not susceptible to basic change
once war has broken out. This, together with the conditions requiring the
use of the troops in war and on a large scale, sets the standards according to
which the army is deployed for battle.

This has always been the practice where large armies took the field, and

there have even been times when the order of battle was considered the
most important part of the action.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the development of

firearms caused a great expansion of the infantry and made it possible to
deploy soldiers in long, thin lines, the order of battle was certainly
simplified, but its handling also called for greater skill. Furthermore, since
the only place for cavalry seemed to be on the wings—out of the range of
fire, and with room to deploy—the army, once arranged in order of battle,
became a solid, indivisible whole. If such an army was split in the middle, it
was like an earth-worm cut in half: both ends were still alive and able to
move, but they had lost their natural functions. The fighting forces were
thus held in what amounted to a bondage of coherence: a minor feat of
dislocation and reorganization became necessary whenever a segment had

to be deployed separately. When the army as a whole had to undertake a
march, it found itself, so to speak, outside its proper element. When the
enemy was close at hand, the marching-order called for the utmost
ingenuity in order to keep one line or one wing at the proper distance from
the other no matter what obstacles it encountered. It was forever necessary
to steal marches on the enemy; and this kind of theft was able to escape
punishment only because the enemy lay in the same bondage.

could protect the wings just as well by being posted behind the army as by
forming an extension of the line; and, furthermore, that it could be used for
purposes other than merely fighting duels with the enemy’s cavalry. This
was a great step forward, if only for the reason that the whole of an army’s
front—the width of its disposition—was now composed of homogeneous
units: it could be dissected into any desired number of units which were
similar to each other and to the whole. At this point the army ceased to be a
monolith and became a many-jointed entity which was pliant and flexible.
Units could be easily detached and reattached without disturbing the order
of battle. This was the beginning of corps made up of all arms—or rather,
this was what made them feasible; the need for them had long been felt.

whole of war and will always be its main element. But order of battle is
really more a matter of tactics than strategy, and our only point in tracing its
development here is to show how tactics, by reorganizing the whole army
into smaller units, has paved the way for strategy.

and the more their individual parts could integrate effectively, the more the
scope for strategy expanded. The order of battle, as we have defined it, was,
therefore, bound to interact with strategy; and the interaction is most
marked at those points where strategy and tactics meet—in other words,
where general deployment of armies passes into actual dispositions for
battle.

We now turn to the subjects of organization, combination, and

deployment of forces, as seen from the point of view of strategy.

what the strength of a division or corps ought to be. The proper question is
how many divisions or corps an army should have. There is nothing more

unwieldy than an army split in three parts, save possibly an army split in
two. In the latter case the general in command will be practically paralyzed.

operational grounds leaves incredible scope for guesswork, and the most
fantastic arguments have been let loose on it. By contrast, it is clear and
accepted that an independent whole such as a corps must have a certain
number of parts. That fact permits the use of genuinely strategic reasons for
settling the number of units that a major force should contain, and what
their strength should be; meanwhile, the strength of smaller units, such as
companies, battalions, and so forth, can be based on tactical grounds.

three distinguishable parts: one to be sent ahead of the main force and
another to bring up the rear. Four parts would obviously be even better,
since the middle part, being the main body, ought to be stronger than either
of the other two. One can proceed to eight, which, in our opinion, is the
optimum number for an army, assuming that one part will always be needed
for the vanguard, three for the main body—a right wing, center, and left
wing—two for the reserve, and one each for dispatching to right and left. It
would be pedantic to insist on these numbers and figures; still, in our view,
they reflect the normal, most common strategic pattern of deployment, and
consequently a convenient system of articulation.

There is no denying that the supreme command of an army (and the

command of any independent force) is markedly simpler if orders only need
be given to three or four other men; yet a general has to pay dearly for that
convenience in two ways. First, an order progressively loses in speed, vigor,
and precision the longer the chain of command it has to travel, which is the
case where there are corps commanders between the divisional commanders
and the general. Second, a general’s personal power and effectiveness
diminishes in proportion to the increase in the sphere of action of his closest
subordinates. A general can make his authority over 100,000 men felt more
strongly if he commands by means of eight divisions than by means of three
divisions. There are various reasons for that; the most important being that a
subordinate commander thinks he has a kind of proprietary right over every
part of his corps, and will almost invariably object to any part being
withdrawn for however short a time. Anyone with any experience of war
will be able to understand this.

that confusion will result. It is hard enough to manage eight subdivisions
from one headquarters; ten is probably the limit. In case of a division,
however, in which there are far fewer means for transmitting orders into
action, four, or at the most five subunits, must be considered the appropriate
figure.

brigades become too large—then corps headquarters must be inserted. But
one must bear in mind that this adds another power to the chain of
command, while simultaneously reducing all the others.

thousand men, and there seem to be two reasons for this upper limit. The
first is that a brigade is meant to be a unit that one man can directly
command by the power of his own voice. The second is that a large body of
infantry should not be left without artillery. A combination of these two
factors will automatically produce a special unit.

We do not want to get too deeply involved in these tactical subtleties, nor

do we mean to go into the controversial question where, and in what
proportions, all three arms should be combined—whether in divisions of
8,000 to 12,000 men, or in corps of 20,000 to 30,000. But surely even the
strongest opponents of such combinations will not deny that only a
combination of the three arms can make a unit of the army independent.
Combined arms are therefore desirable, to say the least, for any unit that
frequently finds itself operating in isolation.

An army of 200,000 men in ten divisions, with five brigades to a

division, will have 4,000 men to a brigade. There is no disproportion in this.
Of course the army may be divided into five corps, each with four divisions
of four brigades, and the brigades would then be 2,500 strong. But
considered purely in the abstract the first arrangement seems preferable.
Not only does the second contain an extra level of command, but five
subdivisions are too few for an army. They make it unwieldy, and the same
is true of four units per corps. Also, 2,500 men would make a weak brigade,
and there would be eighty of these as against fifty under the first
arrangement, which is therefore simpler. All these advantages are
abandoned for the sake of reducing by half the number of generals to whom

one has to give orders. In the case of smaller armies, it must be obvious that
dividing them into corps would be even less suitable.

different decisions. It may be entirely possible to command eight or ten
divisions concentrated on a plain, but it may well be impossible if they are
widely scattered in mountainous terrain. An army cut in two by a broad
river needs a commander for each half. In short there are hundreds of
cogent local and special conditions to which the abstract rule must yield.

Experience shows nevertheless that abstract reasons are used more

frequently and thrust aside less often than one might suppose.

simple outline, which will summarize the salient points side by side.

If the term “subdivisions of the whole” is taken to mean only the first, or

immediate, components, we argue that:

a. The whole will be unwieldy if it has too few subdivisions.
b. If the subdivisions are too large, the commander’s personal authority

will be diminished.

c. Every additional link in the chain of command reduces the effect of an

order in two ways: by the process of being transferred, and by the
additional time needed to pass it on.

 
It follows that the number of subdivisions with equal status should be as

large as possible, and the chain of command as short as possible; the only
qualification being that command is difficult to exercise over more than
eight to ten subdivisions in an army, and over more than four to six of them
in smaller units.

2. Combinations of Arms of the Service. From the strategic point of view,

a combination of forces in the order of battle is important only for those
parts of the whole that, under ordinary conditions, might be stationed
separately, and forced into a separate engagement. It is in the nature of
things that it is the major units, and substantially only those, that are
deployed separately. The reason, which we shall demonstrate elsewhere, is
that detached positions are in most cases based on the idea of, and the need
for, an independent whole.

In a strict sense, therefore, strategy would require that only corps, or, in

their absence, divisions should be made up of a permanent combination of
all arms. In the case of less significant units, temporary combinations made
to meet the needs of the moment should suffice.

But it is clear that a substantial corps, say 30,000 to 40,000 men, will

seldom be found operating as an undivided whole. Any corps of that
strength will need a combination of weapons within its divisions. Anyone
who would deny the delays that occur not to speak of the confusion that
results, when in order to aid the infantry a cavalry unit has to be sent from
somewhere else—possibly a good way off—would betray a total lack of
operational experience.

how close it should be, what proportions it should take, and how much of
each should be held in reserve—all these are purely tactical problems.

each formation in the order of battle are also a completely tactical matter,
relating only to the battle itself. There is, of course, a strategic deployment,
but that depends almost entirely on the dispositions and requirements of the
moment. If a rational basis does exist, it is not included in the meaning of
the phrase “order of battle.” It will therefore be examined elsewhere under
the title “Disposition of the Army.”

body ready for battle. Its parts are organized in such a way that they can
easily be detached from the body and used to meet the demands of the
moment, tactical as well as strategic. When these momentary needs no
longer exist, the parts will return to their original positions. Thus the order
of battle is the first stage and the main basis of that salutary routine which,
like a pendulum, regulates the mechanism of war, and which has already
been discussed in Chapter Four of Book Two.

In the past these intervals did not really seem to be part of war. Take for

example Marshal Luxembourg and his methods of encamping and
marching. We single him out because this is what he is famous for; he can
thus be considered typical of his era. Besides, we have more information
about him, from the Histoire de la Flandre militaire,95 than about any other
general of that period.

Camps used to be pitched with their rear close to a river, a swamp or a

deep ravine—a practice we should consider madness today. The enemy’s
position did not generally determine the orientation of the encampment, so
that frequently the rear was turned toward the enemy, and the front toward
one’s own territory. This type of arrangement, which now strikes us as
incredible, can be understood only where the principal, indeed practically
the only factor in the choice of a campsite is that of convenience. Troops in
camp were not considered to be in a state of war; they were behind the
scenes, so to speak, and entitled to relax. The only security provided was to
make sure that the rear was covered by some obstacle—security only in the
sense understood at the time. It did nothing to meet the possibility of having
to fight an engagement within the camp. But this risk was minimal;
engagements were based on a kind of mutual understanding, much like a
duel that has been arranged at a meeting place convenient to both parties.
Not every type of terrain was suitable for the battles of those days—partly
because of the large numbers of cavalry which, though in the twilight of its
splendor, was still considered (especially by the French) as the principal

arm; and partly because of the armies’ unwieldy order of battle. So rough
country was almost as safe for troops as neutral territory. An army could
make little use of it, and it was considered preferable to go out to meet an
enemy who was advancing for battle. We know of course that the battles of
Fleurus, Stenkerken, and Neerwinden were conceived by Luxembourg in a
different spirit; but under this great commander that spirit was then only in
the process of evolving from the earlier methods, and it was not yet
reflected in the system of encampment. Indeed changes in the art of war
always emanate from decisive actions, which, little by little, tend to modify
the rest. The state of encampment was considered to have little connection
with the actual state of war, as is proved by the expression, il va à la guerre,
which was used to describe a patrol setting out from camp to observe the
enemy.

It was much the same with marches. The artillery went its own way in

order to travel on safer and better roads, while the cavalry generally
alternated on the flanks in order to give every unit in turn the honor of
riding on the army’s right.

In our day, and particularly since the Silesian wars, the condition of the

troops when not in action is permeated by the conditions of combat, and the
mutual relationship of the two is so close that one condition can no longer
be considered complete without the other. Time was when the engagement
was the sword proper, while the period between engagements was the hilt;
the former was the steel blade and the latter the wooden handle glued to it.
The whole was made up of unrelated parts. In our day the engagement is the
edge of the sword, and time out of action is its reverse edge. The whole is
so thoroughly welded together that it is not possible to distinguish where
the steel starts and the iron ends.

Nowadays the existence of an army between engagements is governed

partly by its peacetime rules and regulations, and partly by the tactical and
strategic dispositions of the moment. There are three conditions possible for
military forces: in billets, on the march, or in camp. Each can be as much a
part of tactics as of strategy. In this context, tactics and strategy often come
so close that they seem to, or actuallv do, overlap. Consequently there will
be many dispositions that are simultaneously both tactical and strategic.

We propose to discuss the three conditions between engagements in a

examine the general disposition of the forces, since this provides the
context for billets, camps, or marches.

assigning particular purposes, we have to consider them as a single entity—
that is, a whole meant to fight together. Any deviation from that primary
form must necessarily imply some particular purpose. From this arises the
idea of an army, no matter what its size.

will be its own self-preservation and consequently its security. An army
must be able to exist without any particular difficulty, and to fight as a unit.
These are its two requirements. In practice they lead to the following
considerations concerning the existence and security of the army:

1. Ease of supply
2. Ease of quartering
3. Security of the rear
4. Open ground to its front
5. The position itself on rough ground
6. Strategic points of support
7. Appropriate subdivision of forces.
 
Our comments on these considerations are as follows.
The first two render it desirable to look for agricultural areas, large

towns, and main roads. Their influence is general rather than particular.

The meaning of “security of the rear” will be explained in Chapter 16,

which deals with lines of communication. The first and foremost
requirement here is that the position form a right angle with the direction of
a nearby main line of retreat.

On the fourth point, it is not really possible for an army to command a

whole stretch of territory in the same way as it commands the battlefield
when tactically deployed. It must use the vanguard as its strategic eyes,
sending out individual detachments, spies, and so forth, whose task of
observation will naturally be easier in open than in undulating country. The
fifth point is merely the reverse of the fourth.

Two features differentiate strategic points of support from tactical ones.

First, the army need not be in direct contact with them; and second, they

must be of much greater extent. The reason for this lies in the fact that
strategy, by its very nature, moves in dimensions of space and time that are
greater than those of tactics. If an army takes up a position a mile away
from a coastline or a major river, it is considered to rest on them
strategically, for the enemy will have no room to make a strategic turning
movement. He will not commit himself to prolonged marches lasting for
days and weeks in this space. On the other hand, a lake several miles in
circumference hardly poses a strategic obstacle. A few miles to one side or
the other makes little difference to strategy. Fortresses are strategic points of
support in proportion to their size and effective sphere of operations.

special purposes and requirements, or general ones; only the latter will be
considered here.

with other units required to observe the enemy.

several miles in the rear, leading to deployment in separate sections.

Finally, separate corps usually have to be detached to cover the flanks.
This need for cover does not of course mean that part of the army has to

be detached in order to protect the area on its flanks—the so-called weak
point—from the enemy. In that case, who would defend the flank of the
flank? Popular though it is, this type of notion is utter nonsense. Flanks are
not in themselves weak points, for the simple reason that the enemy has
flanks as well, and cannot endanger ours without incurring a similar risk to
his. The flanks will only become weak points where circumstances no
longer balance each other, where the enemy army is superior in strength,
and where the enemy’s lines of communication are more secure (see
Chapter 16, on Lines of Communication). But these are special cases,
which do not concern us here; neither does the case in which the duties of a
flanking corps include the actual defense of the space to our flank. That
does not fall within the category of general requirements.

While the flanks may not be particularly weak points, they are

particularly important ones. Defense against flanking movements is not so
simple a matter as defense to our front; the necessary measures become
more complicated and demand more time and preparation. This is why one
usually has to take particular care to guard one’s flanks against unforeseen

operations by the enemy. It can be done by placing stronger forces on the
wings than are needed simply to observe the enemy. To dislodge these
forces, even when they do not offer any serious resistance, the enemy will
have to spend time and deploy his forces and intentions in proportion to the
size of the force to be dislodged—and our purpose will then have been
achieved. Further steps will depend on the actual plans of the moment.
Corps posted on the flanks may thus be seen as lateral vanguards, charged
with delaying the enemy’s penetration of the areas beyond the flanks, and
thereby providing time for countermeasures.

withdrawing at the same time, they must obviously not be posted in line
with the main body, but somewhat ahead of it. Even where their retreat
involves no serious fighting, these units should not fall back simply in line
with the main body.

to a natural system of four or five separate parts, according to whether or
not the reserve is stationed with the main force.

contributory factor to a division of forces. The consideration of these two
points connects with what we have already said. An effort must be made to
meet the one without sacrificing too much of the other. In most cases,
subdivision into five separate corps will in itself eliminate the difficulties of
providing shelter and supplies, and will therefore necessitate no major
changes.

have to be stationed if they are to serve the aim of mutual support—in other
words to fight as one. We should here like to recall what we said in the
chapters on duration and decision of the engagement. So much depends on
absolute and relative strength, on weapons and terrain, that no iron-clad
regulation can be formulated; only a general one, a sort of average measure.

The distance of the advance guard is easiest to determine. Since it has to

fall back on the main body of the army, it can be placed at most a good
day’s march away without incurring the risk of having to fight a separate
battle. But it should not be posted any further ahead than necessary for the
security of the army, since the further it has to retire, the more casualties it
will suffer.

engagement fought by an ordinary division of 8,000 to 10,000 men usually
lasts several hours or even half a day before a decision is reached.
Therefore such a division may without hesitation be placed at a distance of
a few hours’ march—say five to ten miles away. For the same reasons, a
corps consisting of three or four divisions may be stationed a day’s march
away—about fifteen to twenty miles.

main body in four or five parts and at given distances. This creates a certain
routine method which automatically determines the subdivision of the army,
provided no special objectives intervene.

able to fight on its own, and that they may be forced to do so, it does not
necessarily follow that the actual point of a divided disposition is that
isolated actions should be fought. The necessity for such a distribution
usually only arises from the conditions imposed by the factor of time. When
the enemy approaches to seek a decision by means of a general
engagement, the strategic phase is over, and everything focuses on the
moment of battle. All reason for divided disposition is now at an end. Once
the battle is joined, questions of quartering and supply are suspended.
Observation of the enemy on the front and flank and reducing his impetus
by moderate resistance have served their purpose. Everything becomes part
of the greater whole, the main battle. The best criterion of the value of a
divided disposition is that the separate distribution is a conditional state and
a necessary evil, while fighting with all forces combined is the true purpose.

Any force that is not completely ready for battle needs an advance guard

to detect and reconnoiter the enemy’s approach before he comes into view.
After all, a troop’s range of vision does not usually extend much beyond its
range of fire. How unfortunate it would be if our eyes could see no further
than our arms can reach! It has been said that outposts are the eyes of the
army. But the need for them varies. It is affected by strength and extent,
time and place, circumstances and the type of war being fought, even by
chance. We should, therefore, not be surprised if military history yields no
definite or simple rules on the use of outposts and advance guards, but
rather a jumble of diverse examples.

Thus we find cases in which an army entrusts its safety to one particular

corps of the advance guard or to a long line of isolated outposts. The two
may be combined, or neither may exist; one guard may be shared by several
advancing columns, or each may have its own. We shall try to set out the
matter clearly, and then find out whether it can be reduced in practice to a
few principles.

Troops on the move are preceded by a force of varying strength as

vanguard, or advance guard, which will become the rear guard should the
line of march be reversed. When the troops are in billets or in camp, the
advance guard takes the form of an extended line of lightly held pickets—
the outposts. Essentially, a larger area can and must be covered when the

army is halted than when it is on the move. So the natural result in the
former case is a line of posts, and in the latter a concentrated corps.

substantial corps, composed of all three arms, to a regiment of hussars;
from a strongly entrenched defensive line held by a combined force to mere
outlying pickets and scouts sent out from the camp. Consequently their
effectiveness ranges from simple observation to actual resistance. The point
of such resistance may not be simply to give the main force the time it
needs to prepare for battle, but also to make the enemy disclose his
dispositions and intentions prematurely. In that case the value of
observation is substantially increased.

Consequently, the strength of advance guards and outposts will vary

according to whether the main body needs to gain more or less time, and
according to whether its resistance is more or less dependent on the
particular disposition the enemy may make.

Frederick the Great, who always had his forces ready for action and

could practically lead them into battle by word of command alone, did not
require strong outposts. That is why he would camp right under the enemy’s
eyes, without any elaborate security system. He would rely on a regiment of
hussars, a light battalion or some scouts and pickets dispatched from camp.
On the march his vanguard consisted of a few thousand horse, usually part
of the cavalry on the flanks of the first line, which would rejoin the army
when the march was over. He seldom kept a permanent corps for vanguard
duty.

Where a small army wants to make use of its concentrated weight and

greater elasticity and take advantage of its superior training and more
determined leadership, everything must be done as did Frederick, when he
was facing Daun, practically sous la barbe de l’ennemi. His superiority
would have been rendered ineffective by deployment of forces far to the
rear, and a cumbersome system of outposts. That errors and excesses could
lead to defeat as at Hochkirch proves nothing against this type of procedure;
on the contrary, the King’s mastery of it is demonstrated by the fact that in
all the Silesian wars only one battle of Hochkirch occurred.

Bonaparte, on the other hand, who can hardly be said to have been

lacking in a steady army and resolute leadership, almost always used a
strong advance guard. Two reasons account for this.

is no longer led into battle as a compact whole and by word of command
alone, in order to settle the score more or less by dint of skill and bravery,
like a large-scale duel. Today the peculiarities of the terrain and the general
circumstances are taken more into account. The battle is composed of a
number of different parts. What used to be a simple decision has become a
complex plan, and the word of command has turned into lengthy
dispositions, based on time-tables and other data.

into action with 30,000 to 40,000 men; Bonaparte with 100,000 or 200,000.

We have chosen these two examples because one can assume that

generals of that caliber would not have adopted such systems unless they
had good reason. On the whole, the use of advance guards and outposts has
developed more broadly in our day. But the Austrian practice shows that
Frederick’s method was not universal in the Silesian wars. Their outpost
system was much stronger and they far more frequently used a corps as
advance guard—which their situation and resources amply warranted. The
most recent wars also provide numerous variations. Even French Marshals
—Macdonald in Silesia, for example, or Oudinot and Ney in Brandenburg
—advanced with armies of 60,000 to 70,000 men, but there is no mention
of any corps serving as vanguard.

view of their strength. But there is another distinction that we must make
clear. An army advancing or retreating over a certain front may have a
single vanguard and rear guard for all its parallel columns, or each column
may have its own. In order to elucidate, let us consider the matter in the
following way.

When a corps is designated as a vanguard, its basic task is to cover only

the advance of the main force in the center. If the main force uses several
adjacent roads which may also be taken by the vanguard, and consequently
covered by it, the flanking columns will of course need no special measures
of protection.

By contrast, the corps that advance at a greater distance and are

operationally independent must provide their own vanguard. The same
applies to any corps that form part of the central main force if, because of
the lie of the land, they find themselves too far from the center. Therefore,

there will be as many vanguards as there are separate bodies advancing
along parallel lines. If individually they are much less effective than one
general vanguard would have been, they really belong in the general
category of tactical dispositions, and the vanguard will vacate its place on
the strategic board. If, however, the central main force has a significantly
larger corps for a vanguard, this will appear to be the vanguard of the whole
army, and will in many ways act as such.

center than to the flanks.

1. The center usually consists of a larger body of troops.
2. The central point of the tract of country over which an army is spread

will always be the most important part; all plans will tend to
concentrate on it, with the result that the battlefield is usually closer to
it than to the flanks.

3. Although a corps stationed ahead of the center cannot really be an

advance guard for the wings as well, it can give them a good deal of
cover indirectly. Normally the enemy cannot pass within a certain
distance to strike a serious blow at one of the flanks, for he will risk an
attack on his own rear or flank. The constraint on the enemy that is
caused by a corps pushed ahead from the center may not be sufficient
to assure the complete security of the lateral corps, but it does
eliminate a number of threats to them.

 
So in cases where the vanguard covering the center is much stronger than

that of the flanks—when, in other words, it consists of a special advance
corps—it no longer simply serves the purpose of a vanguard, which is to
shield the troops immediately behind it from a surprise attack: as an
advance corps, it will have a wider strategic role.

The use of such a corps is based on the following objectives, which

therefore also determine its application:

1. In cases where our dispositions require a lot of time, it can put up a

stronger degree of resistance, and so impose greater caution on the
advancing enemy. In this way it augments the effect of an ordinary
vanguard.

be kept in the background, while contact with the enemy is maintained
by means of a more mobile corps.

between the main body and the enemy, it is useful to keep a corps
close to him for purposes of observation.

The idea that observation could be carried out just as well by a

minor reconnaissance post or mere patrols will not hold up when one
considers how easily these can be dislodged and how inferior are their
means of observation in comparison to those of a large corps.

the cavalry should be attached can move much faster on its own; it can
keep going until a later hour of the night, and be ready for action
earlier in the morning than could the whole army.

natural obstacles for defense. Here too, the center is exceptionally
important. True, at first sight one might suppose that a rear guard of
that sort would be in constant danger of being outflanked. But we must
remember that even if the enemy is pressing hard on the flanks, he still
has to cover the distance to the center if he wants to threaten it
seriously; which allows the rear guard covering the center some extra
time for resistance and for delay in its own withdrawal. If on the other
hand the center falls back sooner than the flanks, things look grave
indeed; it will seem that the enemy had broken through the line, and
one must avoid giving this impression. The need for unity and
cohesion is never greater or more acutely felt by everyone than during
a retreat. The flanks are ultimately meant to reconverge with the
center; even if problems of supply and terrain impose the necessity of
spreading out during a withdrawal, the maneuver usually ends with a
concentration of forces in the center. If we add the fact that the enemy
normally advances on the center with his main force, and consequently
exerts the greatest pressure there, it will be plain that the center’s rear
guard is of particular importance.

 
It follows that the use of a separate corps for the advance guard is

suitable whenever one of the above situations arises. Most of them will

hardly ever occur where the center is no stronger in manpower than the
wings. This was the case when Macdonald advanced against Blücher in
Silesia in 1813, and the latter moved toward the Elbe. Both had three corps
which usually moved side by side in separate columns by different roads;
which explains why there is no mention of a vanguard on either side.

of equal strength is anything but advisable, just as it is very awkward to
divide an army into three parts, as we argued in Chapter Five of Book
Three.96

In the previous chapter we maintained that, in the absence of special

orders to the contrary, the most natural way of disposing a force is a
concentration in the center, with two separate wings. In that case, the
simplest scheme will place the advance guard in front of the center, and so
also ahead of wings. But the basic function of the lateral corps in relation to
the wings is the same as the advance guard’s function in relation to the
front: and consequently, the lateral corps may often be in line with the
vanguard, if not actually ahead of it, depending on circumstances.

Not much can be said about the absolute strength of the advance guard.

These days it has justifiably become general usage to assign its task to one
or more of the main subunits of the whole army, which are reinforced by
part of the cavalry. It will thus consist of a corps if the army is divided into
corps, and of one or more divisions if the army is divided into divisions.

It will be obvious that in this respect as well, the advantage lies where the

army is subdivided into the larger number of units.

The distance at which the vanguard should be stationed depends entirely

on circumstances. There may be cases of its being more than a day’s march
ahead of the main force; in others, it may be immediately in front of it. In
the majority of cases it will be found between five and fifteen miles away.
While this proves to be the distance most frequently required by
circumstances, it should not become a rule for universal application.

Our discussion has lost sight of the subject of outposts, to which we shall

now return.

When we stated at the beginning that outposts will be required for

stationary troops and vanguards for troops on the move, it was in order to
determine the origin of the concepts and to keep them separate for the time

being; but strict adherence to terms would clearly result in little more than
pedantic distinctions.

course do the same, and must always set up outposts for its own security as
well as for that of the whole army. That does not mean it is no longer an
advance guard and has been reduced to nothing more than outposts. The
only time when outposts may be considered to be the opposite of the
concept of the vanguard is when most of the troops making up the advance
guard are split up into separate posts with little or nothing of a concentrated
corps remaining—in other words, where the concept of a long line of
outposts is dominant over that of a concentrated corps.

single night is too short, at any rate, for the enemy to find out what is
covered and what is not. The longer the rest, the more completely each
point of access must be watched and covered. So a substantial halt will tend
as a rule to spread the vanguard into a line of outposts. Two circumstances
chiefly decide whether it will do so completely, or whether the principle of
a concentrated corps will be retained. The first is the distance between the
hostile armies; the second the nature of the terrain.

the extension of their fronts, there will frequently be no room to position an
advance guard corps. Each army must then rely for its security on a series
of small posts.

In any case a concentrated corps, which is less able to cover the

approaches directly, will need more time and space to become effective.
Consequently, wherever the army is considerably spread out, as in billets, it
must be a good distance away from the enemy if all approaches are to be
properly covered by a concentrated corps. That is why winter quarters, for
example, are normally covered by a chain of outposts.

The second factor is the nature of the terrain. For instance where a

natural formation of the land affords the opportunity to form a strong line of
posts with relatively few troops, such a line will be used.

dividing the advance guard into a line of posts: shelter is more easily found
for it that way.

was reached by the Anglo-Dutch army in the Netherlands during the winter
campaign of 1794-1795. There the defensive line consisted of brigades of
all arms forming separate outposts, the whole system being supported by a
general reserve. Scharnhorst, who was with the army, introduced this
practice into the Prussian army on the Passarge in East Prussia in 1807-
With this exception, it has rarely been used in modern wars—mainly
because they have been too full of movement. But it has even been
neglected where it might have come in useful: by Murat, for example, at
Tarutino. If his defensive line had been extended, he would not have lost
some thirty guns in an attack on his outposts.

right conditions. We shall revert to it at a later occasion.

The task of these troops is to observe the enemy and slow down his

advance.

Not even the first of these tasks would be served by a small detachment,

partly because it would be more easily driven back than a large one, and
partly because its means, its tools of observation, would not be sufficiently
powerful.

Moreover, observation is meant to serve an ulterior purpose; namely, to

induce the enemy to deploy his full forces and so reveal not just his strength
but his intentions.

To do no more than that, the mere presence of such a corps would be

enough: it would need only to await the enemy’s offensive deployment and
then fall back.

But it is also meant to delay the enemy’s advance, and that involves real

resistance.

How is it possible to think of waiting till the last moment and of putting

up resistance without the corps running the continual risk of heavy
casualties? Chiefly because the enemy will approach with his own advance
guard, rather than with the crushing and overwhelming power of his whole
army. It is conceivable that from the outset the enemy’s advance guard is
superior to ours—as it is presumably intended to be—and his main force
nearer to it than we are to our own; and, since his main force is already on
the move, it will soon be in a position to give full support to the attack of

the advance guard. Nevertheless, the opening phase, during which our
advance guard has to deal with that of the enemy—its equal, so to speak—
will gain some time and permit observation of the enemy’s approach for a
while without jeopardizing its own retreat.

not entail all the disadvantages that one might at other times expect from its
numerical inferiority. The chief danger arising from resistance to a superior
enemy is the possibility of being outflanked and placed at a definite
disadvantage by an enveloping attack. But this risk is usually diminished by
the fact that the advancing enemy can never be quite sure how near the
support of the main army may lie, and that he therefore has to consider the
possibility of getting his columns caught between two fires. An advancing
army will, as a result, keep the heads of its columns more or less abreast;
only after thoroughly reconnoitering his opponent’s position will he start
cautiously and watchfully to turn one flank or the other. This phase of wary
probing, then, enables our advanced corps to withdraw before any serious
threat to it develops.

turning movement will depend mainly on the nature of the terrain and the
proximity of support. If resistance is stretched over a longer period than
normal—whether as a result of poor judgment or of self-sacrifice in order to
buy time for the army—heavy casualties are bound to follow.

Only in the rarest of cases, when a major natural feature can be utilized,

will the actual defensive fighting be of any consequence; by itself, the
minor engagement that such a corps is able to fight can rarely gain enough
time. Rather this gain will result from three circumstances inherent in the
situation:

1. The enemy’s more cautious and therefore slower advance
2. The duration of actual resistance
3. The withdrawal itself.
 
The withdrawal must be made as slowly as safety will permit. Any good

natural position that is available should be used. It will compel the enemy to
work out fresh attacks and turning-movements, and so gain more time.
Even a real engagement may prove acceptable in a new position.

withdrawal. The frequency of engagements will have to make up for the
shortness of their duration.

primarily on its own numerical strength and the terrain; also on the
distances it has to cover, and the support and protection it receives.

large corps: the more numerous the forces involved, the longer it takes them
to complete any action of whatever type. In a mountainous area, marching
itself becomes slower, individual positions may be held longer and at a
smaller risk, and opportunities to assume such positions present themselves
at every turn.

retreat, and therefore the greater the absolute gain in time resulting from its
resistance. On the other hand, its isolation limits its capacity to resist and its
prospects of support. In that case its withdrawal will take relatively less
time than if it had been closer to the main force.

the duration of its resistance. Caution and watchfulness take a toll that must
be subtracted from its effectiveness.

The time gained by the resistance of an advanced corps may vary

considerably. If the enemy does not appear until after midday this is so
much more time gained, for armies seldom advance by night. Thus, in
1815, the first Prussian Corps, under General Ziethen, numbering about
30,000 men, faced Bonaparte with 120,000 men; yet, on the short stretch
from Charleroi to Ligny—a bare ten miles—it was able to gain more than
twenty-four hours for the concentration of the main Prussian army. General
Ziethen was first attacked about nine on the morning of 15 June, and the
battle of Ligny did not begin until about two in the afternoon of the
sixteenth. General Ziethen admittedly did suffer heavy casualties—5,000 or
6,000 men killed, wounded and taken prisoner.

In terms of practical experience, the following may serve as a guidepost

for calculations of this kind.

has been sent a day’s march of fifteen to twenty miles ahead. In ordinary,
not particularly difficult country, it will be able to delay the enemy for about

half as long again (including the time of his own retreat) as would otherwise
be required to cover the distance. But if the unit has been advanced for only
five miles, the enemy may well be delayed for twice or three times as long
as he would otherwise have spent on the march.

of about ten hours, can be expected to take the enemy fifteen hours from the
time he appears in strength before one’s advanced division until he is in
position to attack our main force. But if the advance guard is posted only
five miles ahead, more than three or four hours, or, indeed, twice that time,
can elapse before the enemy can attack the army. For the time it takes the
enemy to deploy against the advance guard is the same in either case; while
the period of resistance put up by the advance guard in its original position
will be even longer than if it had been posted farther forward.

The upshot is that in the first case the enemy will be hard put to dislodge

an advance guard and attack the main force, all on the same day, as
experience tends to bear out. Even in the second case the enemy will have
to dispose of the advance guard before noon in order to have enough time
for the main battle.

time can be gained by posting the advance guard farther ahead.

The point of posting troops on an army’s flank has already been

explained, and their operations will usually depend on the particular
circumstances. It is simplest to consider them as an advance guard stationed
on the flank; and since they are posted slightly ahead, they will fall back
toward the army in a diagonal direction.

therefore harder to support than an ordinary advance guard, they would be
in greater danger were it not that as a rule the impact of the enemy
diminishes somewhat toward the extreme ends of the line. And even in the
worst of situations, these corps would have room to maneuver without
endangering the main force so directly as would the flight of the advance
guard.

The reception of a retreating advance corps is best and most frequently

done by a considerable cavalry force. This is a good reason for stationing
one’s reserve cavalry between the main force and the advance corps
wherever the distance between them calls for it.

value more from its presence than from its efforts; from the engagements it
might offer rather than from those it actually fights. It is never intended to
stop the enemy’s movements, but rather, like the weight of a pendulum, to
moderate and regulate them so as to make them calculable.

The disposition in camp—bv which we mean all temporary quarters such

as tents, huts, or bivouacs in the open—is, from the strategic viewpoint,
completely identical with any engagement contingent on it. That may not
always be so from the tactical viewpoint, for there are a number of reasons
for choosing somewhat different locations for camping and for the intended
battlefield. Since everything necessary has already been said about the
disposition of the army, or rather the places to be allocated to its various
parts, it remains only to consider the subject of camps from the point of
view of the historian.

From the time when armies had again reached a considerable size, wars

become longer and their separate actions more integrated up till the French
Revolution, armies always camped in tents. That was their normal state.
When spring arrived, they left their quarters and did not return before
winter. Winter quarters should in a sense be considered as a state of non-
war, in which the forces were in a neutral condition and the whole
mechanism was for the time being arrested. Other types of quarters such as
recuperation camps (which preceded winter quarters), or short-term,
cramped billets, were transitional and must be considered as unusual.

This is not the place to inquire how such a regular, voluntary

neutralization of power could have been, and in some cases still is,
considered to be in keeping with the nature and aims of war. We shall
address that question later on. Enough to say it was so.

Since the wars of the French Revolution armies have given up tents

because of the mass of baggage they involve. It is now thought more

advantageous for an army of 100,000 men to have another 5,000 cavalry or
several hundred extra guns instead of 6,000 tent horses. Besides, a large
baggage train is a great encumbrance and of little use in extensive and rapid
operations.

and tear on the troops, and in the devastation of the countryside.

over a period of time it is a relief that will be missed by the troops when it
is not there. For a single day the difference is slight; a tent gives little
shelter against wind and cold, and is far from rainproof. But a slight
difference becomes a major one when the situation recurs two or three
hundred times a year. Increased losses due to sickness will naturally result.

There is no need to explain the way in which the absence of tents

contributes to increased devastation of the countryside.

without tents would have in its own way weakened the energy of warfare by
forcing troops to stay in billets longer and more frequently, or, for lack of
equipment, to forego the occupation of a number of positions that could
have been occupied if tents had been available.

very period warfare underwent an enormous transformation that completely
obliterated such minor and less significant effects.

enormous energy that even these regular periods of rest have disappeared,
and all forces press unremittingly toward the great decision. This fact will
be treated more thoroughly in Book Nine.97 Under those conditions there
can be no question of a diminution in the use of the troops caused by the
absence of tents. Troops now camp in shacks or in the open air, heedless of
weather, season, or terrain, according to the general plan and purpose of the
campaign.

Whether war will retain this energy forever and under all conditions is a

question we shall deal with later. Wherever it does not, lack of tents will
certainly have some bearing on its conduct, but we would doubt whether
such a reaction would ever be strong enough to bring back the custom of
camping in tents. The bounds of military operations have been extended so

far that a return to the old narrow limitations can only occur briefly,
sporadically, and under special conditions. The true nature of war will break
through again and again with overwhelming force, and must, therefore, be
the basis of any permanent military arrangements.

The first is the welfare of the men, so that strength that could have been

usefully employed should not be wasted. The second is the organization of
the march to ensure the punctual arrival of the troops. If 100,000 men were
to march in a single column on one road without breaks in time, the tail of
the column could never reach its destination on the same day as the head.
Progress would either be extremely slow, or the column would, like a
falling jet of water, break up into drops. Such a dispersion, together with the
extra effort that the length of the column would impose on those at the tail,
would soon result in general disorder.

If we can leave this extreme, the smaller the number of troops in a single

column, the easier and more orderly the march will be. It follows that there
is a need for subdivision, which is not the same as the subdivision stemming
from divided tactical dispositions. Separation into marching columns will
generally be based on the disposition of the force, but not necessarily in
each specific case. If one wants to concentrate large numbers in one single
area, they have to split up on the march. But even where a divided
disposition brings about a divided march, the conditions of either the
disposition or the march may predominate. For instance if no battle is
expected and the troops are stationed merely with a view to rest, the
predominant conditions will be those of the march, and these consist chiefly
in the choice of good, well-surfaced roads. With this in mind, roads will in
the former case be chosen with an eye to camps and billets, and in the latter,
camps and billets will be chosen from the point of view of the roads. When
a battle is expected, and the important thing is to get a number of troops to a
particular point, even the worst by-road may be used without a moment’s
hesitation. On the other hand, if an army is still, so to speak, in transit to the

theater of operations, one will choose the nearest main roads for the
columns, and look for the best quarters and camps that happen to be
available in the area.

the whole theater of war—it is a general principle of modern war to
organize the columns in such a way as to have their troops ready for
independent action, no matter what the type of march. This condition will
be met by combining all three arms, by an organic subdivision of the whole,
and by a suitable allocation of command. Marches, then, are the principal
basis for the modern order of battle, as well as being its principal
beneficiaries.

About the middle of the eighteenth century, particularly in Frederick II’s

theater of operations, movement itself began to rank as an autonomous
principle of fighting. Victories were being won by means of unexpected
movements, but the lack of an organic order of battle necessitated the most
complicated and laborious arrangements for the army on the march. In
order to carry out a movement close to the enemy one had to be constantly
ready for battle; but one could not be ready unless the army was
concentrated, for only the army formed a self-sufficient whole. When the
reserve had to keep in line with the main force, keeping its proper distance
never more than a mile from the first, it had to go over hill and dale, with
sweat and strain, involving a considerable knowledge of local conditions;
for where will you find two paved roads running parallel only a mile apart?
The same conditions obtained for the cavalry on the wings when one
marched on the enemy in column. The artillery presented a further problem,
for it needed a road to itself, with infantry protection; so artillery made
infantry lines, which ought to be continuous but were long and irregular
enough already, still longer. None of the proper distances could ever have
been kept. One only need consult the march tables in Tempelhoff’s History
of the Seven Years War to gain an insight into these conditions and the
constraints they imposed on warfare.

Modern war has given armies an organic system of divisions, in which

major units form secondary wholes that are as effective in action as the
whole army, except that they cannot operate for so long. Nowadays, even if
the army is to fight as a whole, columns need no longer be kept together so

as to be able to join up before the action begins. They can do so while the
engagement is in progress.

The smaller a unit, the easier it is to move, the less it requires the kind of

subdivision that results not from a divided order of battle but from the
unwieldiness of its own mass. A small body of troops can march along a
single road, and if it does have to advance along several lines sufficient
adjacent paths can easily be found. The larger the body of troops, the
greater will be the need to divide it, the greater the number of columns and
the call for well-surfaced roads or even actual highways, and consequently
the greater the distances between columns. Arithmetically speaking, the
dangers of subdivision are in inverse ratio to its necessity The smaller the
units, the more likely they are to have to go to one another’s help. The
larger they are, the longer they can look out for themselves. One should
bear in mind what has been said on the subject in the previous book: in
settled areas, fairly well surfaced parallel roads will be found at only a few
miles’ distance from the main road. It therefore becomes evident that, in
planning a march, there will be no major problems that could render speed
and punctual arrival incompatible with a proper concentration of strength.
In mountainous areas, parallel roads are rare, and it is very difficult to make
connections between them; on the other hand, a single column’s power of
resistance is much greater.

The matter will be clearer if considered briefly in concrete form.
Experience shows that a division of 8,000 men with its artillery and some

other transport normally takes an hour to pass a given point. If two
divisions move along a single road, the second will arrive about an hour
after the first. As was pointed out in the sixth chapter of Book Four, a
division of that size can usually hold its own for several hours, even against
superior odds; so the second division ought to arrive in time even in the
worst possible situation—that in which the first had been forced to go into
action immediately on its arrival. Moreover, in the settled areas of Central
Europe one can usually find usable side roads within an hour’s distance of
the main road. They may be used for the march without one’s having to
march cross-country, as so often happened in the Seven Years War.

Experience also teaches that the head of a column of four divisions with a

cavalry reserve can generally do fifteen miles in eight hours, even on
inferior roads. At the rate of an hour per division, and the same for the

cavalry and artillery reserves, the march will take thirteen hours to
complete. This is not too long a time, and yet enough for a total of 40,000
men to march along one road. With a force of this size, one can, in addition,
seek out and use the side roads, and so easily shorten the march. If even
more troops had to use the road, one could assume that they would not all
have to arrive on the same day. Armies of that size do not nowadays give
battle at the moment they meet, but usually wait till the next day.

examples; we did so simply in order to make things clearer and to show, by
examining actual experience, that in modern war it is no longer very
difficult to organize a march. Prompt and rapid marches no longer require
the special skill and the wealth of local knowledge which Frederick the
Great, for instance, had to apply during the Seven Years War. Rather, with
the present organic division of the army, marches almost organize
themselves; at least they do not call for complicated planning. In contrast to
the days when battles were conducted by word of command alone while
marches called for formal plans, the battle is now what calls for planning,
while marching hardly calls for more than the word of command.

Marches are either at right angles to the front or parallel to it. The latter

are also known as “flank marches” and alter the geometrical pattern of the
army’s parts. Those that had been disposed in line will then be marching
one behind the other, and vice versa. While the direction of the march can
be at any angle inside of ninety degrees, the marching order must be of one
definite kind or the other.

Such a geometric alteration can be perfectly accomplished only in the

realm of tactics, and then only by using a so-called deployment in file,
which is impossible where great numbers are involved. In the realm of
strategy it is still less feasible. In the old order of battle, the parts that
changed their geometrical relationship were only the center and the wings;
today they are units of the first magnitude—corps, divisions, or brigades—
depending on the distribution of the whole. Here too, the effects of the
modern order of battle will make themselves felt; since it is no longer
essential to assemble the whole army before the start of the action, it has
become necessary to take greater care that the troops that are assembled
will constitute a whole. If two divisions were to be disposed one in reserve
behind the other, and were then to advance toward the enemy along two

separate roads, we would not dream of sending part of each division by a
different road. Each would naturally be given a road to itself: they would be
told to keep abreast, and if fighting should occur it would be up to each
divisional commander to provide his own reserve. Unity of command is
much more important than the original geometrical relationship. If both
divisions reach their destinations uneventfully, they can resume their
original disposition. If two divisions stationed side by side are to march
parallel to each other on two roads, it is even less likely to occur to anyone
to send the second line, or reserve, of each division along the rearmost road;
one road would be given to each of the divisions, and one of them would
act as the reserve for the period of the march. If an army of four divisions
were to advance against the enemy, with three divisions in the front and the
fourth in reserve, it would be natural to assign one road to each of the three
divisions and to make the reserve follow the middle one. But if one cannot
find three roads close enough to be convenient, one need not hesitate to
advance along two; no serious disadvantages are to be expected.

The same applies in the opposite case of a flank march.
A further point concerns columns that march off from the right or left

flank. In the case of flank marches this works out automatically. One would
certainly not march off from the right flank in order to move leftward. In a
march to the front or rear, the marching order should be chosen with an eve
to the direction of the road relative to the future line of deployment. This
can indeed often be done in tactics, for the scale here is smaller and the
geometrical relationships are easier to keep in view. From the strategic
point of view it is completely impossible, notwithstanding certain analogies
with tactics that have occasionally been suggested: these are sheer pedantry.
Formerly, it is true, the whole order of march was purely an affair of tactics,
since even on the march the army remained an undivided whole with a view
to fighting only as a unit. For instance Schwerin, when he marched off from
the area of Brandeis on the fifth of May, had no idea whether his battlefield
would be to his right or to his left; hence he had to make his famous
countermarch.

columns, the outer pair of columns were formed by the cavalry wings of the
first and second lines, while the infantry wings of both lines formed the two
center columns. All these columns could march off from the right or from

the left, or the right wing from the right and the left wing from the left, or
the right from the left and the left from the right. The name of the
movement in the last of these cases would have been “double column from
the center.” Even though all these movements should have stood in direct
relation to the subsequent deployment, basically they did nothing of the
kind. When Frederick the Great went into battle at Leuthen, his army had
marched off in four columns from the right wing. This made the transition
to marching in line (which has been greatly admired by historians) very
easy, since it happened to be the Austrian left wing that Frederick wanted to
attack. Had he wanted to turn the right wing, he would have had to make a
countermarch as he had done at Prague.

While such maneuvers were unsuited to their purpose even then, they

would be downright frivolous today. The relation of the future battlefield to
the road along which the army moves is as little known now as it was then,
and the short time lost by marching off in the wrong order has become
incomparably less important. Here too the new order of battle proves
beneficial: it is quite immaterial which division is the first to arrive or
which brigade is the first to come under fire.

Under these circumstances it has ceased to make a difference whether

you march off to the left or to the right, except that it will balance out the
troops’ fatigue if it is done alternately. This is the only reason, though a
most important one, for retaining the dual method of marching off, even
where major bodies of troops are involved.

Under such conditions, marching off from the center automatically

disappears as a distinct maneuver, and will only happen by accident. A
march from the center in which the two middle columns move as one is
strategic nonsense anyway, for it assumes the availability of twin highways.

involves dividing the whole into parts that are to reform as a whole when
the march is over. In modern war it is no longer thought necessary to keep
the parts close to one another: during a march they are allowed to spread
out further and to look out for themselves. This can easily result in
engagements in which each of the parts fights alone, and which must
therefore be considered complete in themselves. This is why we have found
it necessary to go into such detail.

Since incidentally (as was pointed out in Chapter Two98 of this book) a

disposition into three parts in line will prove to be the most natural
wherever there are no overriding special purposes, three columns will also
tend to be most natural for the order of march.

There is one thing we wish to add: the concept of a column is not based

merely on the line of march of one body of troops. In strategy the term also
applies to bodies of troops marching along the same road on different days.
The fact is that troops are divided into columns mainly in order to shorten
and facilitate the march, for a small force marches faster and more easily
than a large one. This purpose is of course also served if the troops move on
different days rather than along different roads.

Modern armies have long been accustomed to consider a fifteen-mile

march as a day’s work. In extensive operations it must be reduced to an
average of ten miles in order to allow for the requisite days of rest on which
necessary repairs and maintenance can be carried out.

A division of 8,000 men takes eight to ten hours for such a march in level

country and on ordinary roads. In mountainous country, it will take ten to
twelve. If a column consists of a number of divisions, a few hours longer
will be required, even discounting the delayed starting time of the later
divisions.

It is clear that the day is pretty well filled by such a march, and that one

cannot compare the strain on a soldier loaded with his pack for ten or
twelve hours with an ordinary fifteen-mile walk which would not take an
individual more than five hours on a decent road.

Forced marches, if undertaken one at a time, may cover twenty-five

miles, or thirty at the most; if they continue, only twenty.

A march of twenty-five miles will call for a rest stop of several hours,

and a division of 8,000 men will not manage it in less than sixteen hours
even on good roads. If the distance to be covered is thirty miles and several
divisions are involved, one has to allow a minimum of twenty hours.

What concerns us here is a march by several complete divisions from one

campsite to another, since this is the most common type that occurs in a
theater of operations. Where several divisions are to form a single column,
the first should be assembled and marched off in advance, and will
consequently reach camp that much earlier. But this difference in time can
never be so great as the time a division takes to pass a given point—the
time required for what the French so aptly describe as its découlement (run-

off). Thus the soldier is spared but little exertion, and each of the marches
will take longer because of the larger number of troops involved. Moving a
division by similar methods of assembling and marching off its brigades
one at a time is only rarely practicable; that is why the division has been
treated as a unit.

On long route marches, with troops transferring from one billet to

another, marching in small detachments and without points of assembly,
they may indeed cover longer distances. In fact they will be longer because
of the detours needed to reach their billets.

The maximum amount of time is taken up by marches on which troops

have to be reassembled daily by divisions or even by corps, and must then
still go to their billets. This type of march is advisable only with a relatively
small body of troops and in areas rich in resources; in that case easier
means of obtaining provisions and shelter will compensate sufficiently for a
longer period of exertion. There can be no doubt that the Prussian army, on
its retreat in 1806, was mistaken in the practice of putting up, the troops in
billets every night in order to feed them. Supplies could just as well have
been procured in bivouacs, and the army need not have made immense
exertions to cover some 250 miles in no less than fourteen days.

whenever one encounters poor roads or mountainous country that it will be
difficult to estimate accurately the time a certain march should take—let
alone to set up any general rule. The best a theorist can do is to point out the
pitfalls that beset the problem. In order to avoid them the most meticulous
calculations, as well as a large margin for unforeseen delays, are necessary.
Weather conditions and the state of the troops must also be taken into
account.

Once tents had gone out of use and troops began to be supplied by

requisitioning food on the spot, an army’s baggage shrank considerably.
One would expect the most important result to be an acceleration of
mobility and, as a consequence, an increase in the range of a day’s march.
But this will only occur under certain circumstances.

The change did little to accelerate marches in the theater of operations.

The reason is the well-known fact that whenever in earlier times the
situation called for an exceptional amount of marching, the baggage had
always been left behind or sent ahead, and, in general, separated from the

troops for as long as movements of this kind were still in progress.
Baggage, in point of fact, rarely had any influence on movements; once it
had ceased to be a positive encumbrance, no more notice was taken of it—
regardless of how much damage it might suffer. So the Seven Years War
produced marches that have still not been surpassed: Lacy’s, for instance, in
1760, in support of the Russian diversion toward Berlin. He covered the
220 miles from Schweidnitz through Lusatia to Berlin in ten days—a rate of
22 miles a day, which would be astounding even nowadays for a corps of
15,000 men.

The very change in the method of supplying the troops, on the other

hand, has tended to retard a modern army’s movements. Troops that have to
do part of their foraging for themselves, as they often must, spend more
time on it than they would need if they only had to get their rations from the
bread-cart. Besides, on marches of substantial length one cannot allow large
numbers of troops to encamp all in one spot; divisions have to be dispersed
to make their feeding easier. Finally, it usually happens that some part of the
army, particularly the cavalry, has to be put up in billets. Taken altogether,
all this causes considerable delay. Hence the fact that Bonaparte, when
pursuing the Prussians and trying to cut off their retreat in 1806, and
Blücher, intending to do the same to the French in 1813, both required ten
days to cover only 150 miles or so. That was a rate which Frederick the
Great achieved, baggage and all, when marching from Saxony to Silesia
and back.

considerably in mobility and flexibility because the amount of baggage has
decreased. For one thing, while cavalry and artillery remain at the same
level the number of horses is reduced, thereby reducing the need for forage.
For another there is less constraint in occupying positions, since one no
longer has to worry all the time about the safety of an endless train of
baggage in the rear.

4,000 wagons, which were covered by half of his army split into battalions
and even companies. A march like that would be impossible today, even
when facing the most timid of adversaries.

On long route marches—for example, from the Tagus to the Niemen—

the benefit is, of course, more perceptible; while a normal day’s march is

about the same because of the number of wagons still required, in cases of
urgency it may be increased without the same degree of sacrifice.

In general, the reduction of baggage will result in a saving of effort rather

than an acceleration of movement.

A single moderate march will not blunt the instrument; but a series of

moderate marches will begin to tell, while a series of strenuous marches
will naturally do much greater harm.

In the zone of operations the lack of provisions and shelter, badly rutted

roads and the need to be constantly prepared for battle, are the causes of the
disproportionate exertions which take their toll of man and beast, wagons
and clothing.

It is commonly said that a long period of rest is not good for the physical

health of an army, and that there is more sickness at such times than during
periods of moderate activity. It may well be that sickness does occur when
soldiers are crowded together in cramped quarters, but it can occur just as
easily in billets along the march. The cause of such sickness should never
be attributed to a lack of fresh air and movement, since these may so easily
be provided by exercises.

Consider the difference to a man’s unstable and upset organism between

falling ill indoors and falling ill on the open road, mired in mud and rain
and loaded down by his pack. Even if he is taken ill in camp, he can soon be
sent to the nearest village where medical help of some sort will be found;
but if stricken on a march he lies by the road for hours on end without any
relief whatsoever, and then must drag himself along as a straggler for miles.
How many minor ailments this will aggravate; how many serious ones will
end in death! Consider also the dust and burning heat of summer, when
even a moderate march may cause heat exhaustion. Tortured by parching
thirst, the soldier will rush to any cold spring, only to catch some disease
and his death.

warfare. Tools are there to be used, and use will naturally wear them out.
Our only aim is clarity and order; we are opposed to bombastic theories that
hold that the most overwhelming surprise, the fastest movement or the most
restless activity cost nothing; that they are rich mines which lie unused
because of the generals’ indolence. The final product may indeed be
compared to that of gold and silver mines: one looks only at the end result
and forgets to ask about the cost of the labor that went into it.

Lengthy marches outside the theater of war are normally made under

easier conditions, and daily casualties are fewer. On the other hand, the
slightest sickness usually keeps a man away from his unit for a long time: it
is difficult for the convalescent to catch up with the advancing army.

horses; vehicles tend to break down, and confusion results. A march of 500
miles or more will always cause an army to arrive at its destination in a
highly weakened condition, especially where horses and wagons are
concerned.

enemy’s eyes, the disadvantages add up. Where substantial numbers are
involved and the general conditions are adverse, losses can mount to
unbelievable proportions.

Let us give a few examples to illustrate our point.
When Bonaparte crossed the Niemen on 24 June 1812, his enormous

center, which he subsequently led to Moscow, numbered 301,000 men. At
Smolensk on 15 August he detached 13,500 men, so 287,500 men should
have been left. The actual strength of his army, however, was only 182,000
men—which means that 105,500 had been lost.99 Bearing in mind that only
two engagements worth the name had so far taken place—one between
Davout and Bagration and the other between Murat and Tolstoy-Ostermann
—the French battle casualties may have been 10,000 men at most. The
losses due to sickness and stragglers for this period of 52 days and an
advance of about 350 miles would thus number 95,000 men, or about one-
third of the whole army.

Three weeks later, at the battle of Borodino, losses (including those in

action) had reached 144,000 men, and at Moscow, a week later, they came

to 198,000 men. Overall, in the first of the above periods, the army’s daily
rate of loss was 1 in 150 of the original total strength; in the second period,
1 in 120; and in the third, 1 in 19.

Niemen up to Moscow; but one must bear in mind that it took 82 days to
cover only about 600 miles, and that the army twice stopped altogether—
once for some 14 days at Vilna and the other time for some 11 days at
Vitebsk—which must have given many stragglers time to catch up. This
fourteen weeks’ advance was not made at the worst time of year nor on the
worst of roads: it was made in summer and the roads were mostly sandy.
The impeding factors were the enormous masses of troops moving along a
single road, the shortage of supplies, and an enemy who, though in retreat,
was not by any means in flight.

army’s advance from Moscow to the Niemen—but perhaps we should
observe that the pursuing Russian army left the Kaluga area with 120,000
men and arrived in Vilna with 30,000. How few were lost in actual fighting
during that time is common knowledge.

Let us take one more example, this one from Blücher’s campaign of 1813

in Saxony and Silesia, which was notable not for any length of march, but
for a series of movements to and fro. York’s corps opened the campaign on
16 August with about 40,000 men and by 19 October numbered a mere
12,000. The main engagements that it fought—at Goldberg, Löwenberg, on
the Katzbach, at Wartenburg and the battle of Möckern (Leipzig) cost,
according to the best authorities, 12,000 men. Consequently, in eight weeks
its losses from other causes came to 16,000 men—two-fifths, that is, of its
initial strength.

one intends to wage a mobile war. All other plans must be adjusted to that
fact; and above all, replacements must be provided for.

Two factors will prevent an army from taking up billets: the proximity of

the enemy and the rapidity of movement. Billets are evacuated as the
decision draws near, and not reoccupied until after it has been reached.

In the more recent wars—that is, in all the campaigns of the last twenty-

five years—the elemental force of war has been unleashed with all its
energy. In most cases activity and effort have been pushed to their very
limits. But all these were campaigns of short duration. They rarely took
more than six months, and frequently less, to reach their goal—that is, the
point where the defeated party felt ready to seek an armistice, or even
peace, or where the winning side no longer had the momentum required for
victory. During such times of major exertion billets could hardly be
considered. Even at the time of a victorious pursuit, when there was no
longer any question of danger, movements were too rapid for this type of
relief.

Where for whatever reason the sequence of events is less impetuous,

where there is a balanced suspension of forces, the billeting of troops in
solid shelter must be given first consideration. This necessity may affect

operations in two ways: one may attempt to gain extra time and security by
means of a stronger system of outposts and a larger advance guard placed
further forward; and the degree of wealth and cultivation of the area may
take precedence over considerations of its tactical advantages and geometric
patterns of lines and points. A commercial town with twenty or thirty
thousand inhabitants, or a road which runs through an area of substantial
villages and prosperous towns, will greatly facilitate the concentration of
large forces; and such a concentration in turn confers so much freedom and
ease of movement that these advantages will amply compensate for those
that a better tactical position might have provided.

for billets, since that is chiefly a subject of tactical concern.

chief or a secondary consideration. During a campaign the disposition of
troops may depend on purely tactical and strategic needs, and their comfort
will be best served by putting them in billets near the point of
concentration. This is particularly true of cavalry. In that case, billets are a
secondary consideration. They are a substitute for camp, and must thus be
located within a radius that permits the troops to reach their positions in
good time. If, on the other hand, troops are quartered with a view to
recuperation, housing becomes the primary consideration that governs
everything else, including the actual choice of the point of concentration.

The first problem here is the shape of the billeting area as a whole. The

usual shape is an elongated oval, a mere broadening, as it were, of the
tactical order of battle. The point of assembly is in front of it, and the
headquarters behind. These three determinants, as it happens, constitute an
obstacle to, and are practically in conflict with, the safe concentration of the
army before the arrival of the enemy.

The more the billets form a square or, better yet, a circle, the quicker the

troops can be assembled at a given point, which is the center; the farther
back the concentration point is located, the longer the enemy will take to
reach it, and the longer the time available. A concentration point to the rear
of the billets cannot possibly be threatened. Conversely, the farther forward
the headquarters is located, the faster it will receive reports, and the better
informed the commander will be. But there are reasons for the first of the
arrangements which have to be considered to some extent.

order to prevent the enemy from receiving supplies from it. But this
reasoning is neither completely sound nor very important. It is sound only
in regard to the outermost wings, and does not apply to the gap that
develops between two sections of the army whose respective billets are
grouped around their concentration point. No enemy unit would venture
into such a gap. It is not very important, because there are simpler means of
protecting the countryside from enemy requisitions than scattering the army
too thinly.

The argument goes as follows. In the first place troops who are suddenly
called to arms will always leave a wake of stragglers, sick, baggage,
supplies, etc., in the billets, which if the concentration point is in the rear
the enemy can easily capture. In the second place, one must prevent the
enemy from attacking detached regiments and battalions one by one in
cases where units of his cavalry have bypassed the advance guard or
scattered it altogether. An assembled unit, though it may be weak and may
have to succumb in the end, will bring him to a stop, and time will have
been gained.

the aim should be maximum security.

arrangement of the billeting area would be an oblong that comes close to
being a square or a circle; the concentration point should be in the center,
and wherever troops are at all numerous headquarters should be in the front
lines.

So far as the protection of the wings is concerned, the points we made

when discussing the general disposition of the army remain applicable.
Thus, any corps that are detached on either side of the main force should
have their own concentration point in line with that of the main force, even
when a joint battle is intended.

determined by favorable features of the terrain while cities and villages
determine the area of the billets, it will easily be seen how seldom matters
of this sort are governed by geometric laws. But the point does deserve

attention because, like all general laws, it does to some degree affect the
general run of cases.

favorable locations for billets. One is the choice of a natural feature behind
which billets may be occupied; then a number of small detachments will be
able to observe the enemy. Billets may also be located to the rear of
fortresses; if the enemy has no means of estimating the strength of the
garrisons, he will treat them with much more caution and respect.

The subject of fortified winter quarters will be dealt with in a separate

chapter.

stationary forces in that the former should not be far from the road, but
strung out along it, in order to avoid detours. Provided the spread does not
exceed a short day’s march, this will be anything but harmful to rapid
concentration.

In “the presence of the enemy,” to use the technical term—that is, in all

cases where there is no significant distance between the two advance guards
—the strength and position of the advance guards, along with that of the
outposts, will be governed by the size of the billeting area and the time
needed for the concentration of the troops. Where, on the other hand, the
strength and position of advance guard and outposts are determined by the
enemy and the general situation, the size of the billeting area will depend on
the amount of time which the resistance of the advance guard will afford.

been discussed in Chapter Three100 of this book. Its duration is reduced by
the time it takes to alert and call out the troops; only the time which remains
is available for their concentration.

Once again we should like to consolidate our ideas into a proposition that

will prove valid under most ordinary circumstances. If the billets are spread
out within a radius measured by the distance to the advance guard, with the
point of assembly lying approximately at the center of the billeting area, the
time gained by delaying the enemy’s advance is the time available for
alerting and calling out the troops. In most cases this will be enough, even if
the reports are not transmitted by signal lights or shots etc., but merely by
relays of messengers, which is the only reliable method.

area of about 700 square miles. In a moderately populated region, such an
area would contain about 10,000 houses. Discounting the advance guard, an
army of 50,000 men would find this very comfortable at about four men per
house. Even an army twice that size would not be seriously overcrowded at
nine men per house. Where, on the other hand, the advance guard cannot be
posted more than five miles out, the area will be limited to 80 square miles.
Even though the time gained does not diminish in exact proportion to the
distance of the advance guard, and a distance of five miles means a six-hour
span, extra precautions must be taken where the enemy is this close. An
army of 50,000 men would be able to find adequate billets in an area that
size only if it were very thickly populated.

which 10,000 or 20,000 men can be concentrated.

enemy and has a sizable advance guard, troops may be left in billets even
when facing a concentrated enemy force, as Frederick the Great did at
Breslau early in 1762, and Bonaparte at Vitebsk in 1812. When facing the
concentrated enemy army, the proper distance and suitable arrangements
will ensure the safety of the troops while assembling; but one must
remember that an army engaged in rapid assembly is in no position to do
anything else during that time. In other words, it will be unable immediately
to exploit any opportunities that arise, and this will deprive it of a large part
of its effectiveness. Consequently, an army may be completely quartered in
billets under only the three following conditions:

1. If the enemy does the same
2. If the condition of the troops makes it absolutely essential
3. If the army’s immediate task is limited to the defense of a strong

position, and so nothing matters but the prompt concentration of the
troops at that point.

 
The campaign of 1815 provides a remarkable example of the

concentration of an army quartered in billets. General Ziethen, commanding
Blücher’s advance guard of 30,000 men, lay at Charleroi, a mere ten miles
from Sombreffe where the army was to assemble. The farthest billets of the

main army, however, were forty miles from Sombreffe, beyond Ciney on
one side, and as far as Liège on the other. Yet the troops from the Ciney
area arrived at Ligny several hours before the battle there began, and those
close to Liège (Bülow’s corps) would have as well, but for chance and
faulty communications.

There is no doubt that the safety of the Prussian army had been

neglected; but in explanation one must say that all the arrangements had
been made while the French were also still widely scattered in billets. The
mistake lay simply in not changing the arrangements as soon as it was
learned that the French were on the move and that Bonaparte himself was
with them.

It remains noteworthy that the Prussian army might have been assembled

at Sombreffe before the enemy attacked. Blücher, it is true, got news of the
enemy’s advance and began to concentrate his troops on the night of the
fourteenth of June—that is, twelve hours before Ziethen was actually
attacked. But by nine the following morning Ziethen was under fire, and it
was not until that very hour that Thielmann at Ciney received orders to
move toward Namur. He thus had to assemble his troops into divisions, and
then march thirty-two miles to Sombreffe, which he did in twenty-four
hours. General Bülow could have been there at the same time if he had been
properly impressed by the order.

Bonaparte made his attack at Ligny. One of the things that held him back
was his apprehension at having Wellington on one side and Blücher on the
other. In other words, the inequality between his strength and theirs
contributed to his hesitation. It only goes to show how even the most
resolute commander can be thwarted by having to grope his way carefully,
as is inevitable in all complicated situations.

of a tactical than a strategic nature; but we thought it better to stray into the
tactical field than to take the risk of not making ourselves clear.

More recent wars, by which we mean those since the Peace of

Westphalia, have, through the efforts of governments, assumed a more
regular, interconnected character. Operational requirements are dominant
and even in the sphere of maintenance and supply call for appropriate
arrangements. Admittedly, seventeenth and eighteenth century wars had
long quiescent periods when fighting practically stopped—we refer to
regular winter quarters—yet these too were subject to their operational
purpose. These intervals were caused not by problems of supply but by bad
weather. Since they always ended with the approach of summer, continuous
military activity was the rule for as long as the season allowed.

Transition from one condition, or method, to another has always been

gradual, and this case is no exception. In the wars against Louis XIV, it was
still the allies’ practice to send their troops to winter quarters in distant
provinces where it was easier to supply them. By the time of the Silesian
wars this was no longer done.

until states replaced feudal levies with mercenary troops. Feudal obligations
were transformed into money payments, and liege service either vanished
altogether in favor of recruitment, or fell only on the lower classes. The
nobility considered the furnishing of recruits as a kind of tribute, a human
tax, as they still do in Russia and Hungary. At any rate, as we have stated
elsewhere, armies now became instruments of the central government, and
their cost was borne mainly by the treasury or public revenue.

regular replacement of the fighting forces were to change methods of
maintenance and supply. Once the Estates had been exempted from the
former in exchange for monetary tribute, they could not very well be
burdened with the latter by stealth. So the government, the treasury, had to
carry the burden of subsistence: the army could not be allowed to live off
the land while it was stationed on its own territory. Governments, therefore,
had to treat the maintenance of the army as their responsibility alone. In this
way, maintenance presented increased difficulties, for two reasons: the
government had to assume responsibility for it, and the fighting forces were
required to remain permanently in the field.

Not only an independent military class but also an independent system

for supplying it were thus created, and were developed to the fullest
possible extent.

state’s demesnes possibly some distance away, and stored in depots; they
had also to be taken from these depots to the troops by the army’s own
transport, baked nearby by their own bakeries, and finally picked up again
for distribution by the units’ own vehicles. We have considered this system,
not only because it explains some of the characteristics of the wars in which
it was employed but also because it will never fall completely into disuse.
Some aspects of it will always recur.

Military institutions thus tended to become more and more independent

of the country and the people.

In consequence warfare became more regular, better organized, and more

attuned to the purpose of war—that is, to its political objective. Movement,
on the other hand, was much more limited, much more constrained, and war
was waged with far less vigor. Now one was tied to depots and bound by

the effective range of transport, with the inevitable result that rations were
cut to the barest minimum. Nourished often by only a meager crust of
bread, soldiers tottered about like shadows, and there was not even the
prospect of better things to come to comfort them in their privations.

an army, and cites Frederick the Great’s accomplishments with ill-fed
soldiers, is not taking a dispassionate view of the subject. Ability to endure
privation is one of the soldier’s finest qualities: without it an army cannot
be filled with genuine military spirit. But privation must be temporary; it
must be imposed by circumstances and not by an inefficient system or a
niggardly abstract calculation of the smallest ration that will keep a man
alive. In the latter case it is bound to sap the physical and moral strength of
every man. We cannot use Frederick the Great’s military accomplishments
as a standard. For one thing his enemies used the same system; and for
another, who can tell how much more he might have attempted if he could
have fed his troops as well as Bonaparte did whenever circumstances
allowed?

to the feeding of horses, since forage, because of its bulk, is much more
difficult to procure. A horse’s ration weighs about ten times as much as a
man’s, and the number of horses per man is not one to ten, but one to four
or one to three even today. In the past it was one to three or one to two, so
that the weight of the horses’ rations was three, four, or five times that of
the men’s. Therefore, the simplest possible way was found to meet the
army’s needs: foraging expeditions. These imposed other major limitations
on warfare. First of all it became of prime importance to fight on enemy
soil, and second it became impossible to stay in any area for long. But by
the time of the Silesian wars foraging expeditions had become far less
common; they were found to place a far greater burden of devastation and
strain on a region than a system of satisfying the needs of the army by local
requisitions and deliveries.

the stage of war, the governments’ means were no longer adequate. The
whole military system, which had been built on these limited means and in
turn found security in them, broke up, and that included the sector that
concerns us here, the supply system. The French Revolutionary leaders

cared little for depots and even less for devising a complicated mechanism
that would keep all sections of the transport system running like clockwork.
They sent their soldiers into the field and drove their generals into battle—
feeding, reinforcing, and stimulating their armies by having them procure,
steal, and loot everything they needed.

between these two extremes: they chose the most suitable methods from
those available; and this is likely to remain so in the future.

in the locality, no matter to whom it belongs—falls into the following four
categories: supplies furnished by local households; requisition by the troops
themselves; general requisition; and depots. Normally all four are used
simultaneously, with one predominating; but it can happen that only a
single one is used.

1. Living off local households or the community, which amounts to the

same thing. Supplies for several days will always be available in any
community, even if it consists only of consumers, as in the case of large
towns. It will thus be understood that even the most populous town can
furnish food and lodgings for a day for about as many soldiers as there are
inhabitants without any special preparations, and for longer if their number
is substantially smaller. In major towns this works out very well, for it
means substantial quantities of troops can all be fed and housed in a single
place. It would not be satisfactory in smaller towns, and even less so in
villages. A population of 3,000 to 4,000 per 25 square miles is pretty dense,
and it could only feed some 3,000 or 4,000 troops. If greater numbers were
to be fed, they would have to be dispersed so far afield that other
requirements would be hard to meet. On the other hand, in the country, and
even in small towns, the sort of supplies that matter most in war are much
more plentiful. A farmer’s stock of bread is usually enough to feed his
family for a week or two. Meat can be come by every day, and there is
generally a big enough stock of vegetables to last till the next harvest. As a
result, in billets that have not been previously occupied, one can generally
find food for three or four times the number of inhabitants for several days,
which again works out extremely well. Accordingly, where there is a
population of 2,000 to 3,000 per 25 square miles (no substantial town being
occupied) a force of 30,000 men would take up 100 square miles or so—

requiring a width of 10 miles. An army 90,000 strong (say 75,000 fighting
men) marching in three parallel columns, would thus need a front of only
30 miles, provided three roads were available within that space.

If the area is occupied by several columns in succession, special

arrangements on the part of the local authorities will be required, but that
should be no problem for the needs of a day or two at a time. Consequently,
if the 90,000 men were followed the next day by another 90,000, the second
force need suffer no privation; and 150,000 fighting men is a considerable
army.

The question of forage for the forces is even easier, since forage need not

be either ground or baked. Feed enough until the next harvest is bound to be
in store for the local horses, so that even where there is little stall-feeding,
no shortage should arise. Forage of course should be requisitioned from the
community rather than the individual household. It goes without saying that
in organizing a march one will have to keep certain considerations in mind
concerning the nature of the country, so as not to billet the cavalry in
industrial or other areas where forage will be scarce.

density—say 2,000 to 3,000 per 25 square miles—a force of 150,000
combatants can live off the local inhabitants and communities within a very
small area for a day or two, which will not preclude its fighting as a unit—
in other words, it is possible to provision such a force without depots and
other preparations on an uninterrupted march.

based on this conclusion. The French marched from the Adige to the lower
Danube and from the Rhine all the way to the Vistula without substantial
means of provisioning other than living off the land, and never suffered
want. Since their operations were based on physical and moral superiority
and were undeniably successful, certainly never being delayed by
indecision or timidity, their victorious course was for the most part moving
as an uninterrupted march.

consists more of tradespeople than of farmers, where the soil is poor, or the
area has already been occupied several times—the yield will naturally also
be lower. But one must bear in mind that by expanding the front of a
column from 10 to 15 miles, one more than doubles the area—from 100 to

200 square miles. This is an extent which will normally still permit the
column to fight as a unit. So even where conditions are unfavorable, this
kind of subsistence is possible provided the troops remain uninterruptedly
on the move.

unless arrangements had been made in advance. There are two such
arrangements without which a substantial army cannot survive even today.
The first is to equip the troops with a wagon train that will carry enough
bread or flour—the most essential part of their provisions—to last for three
or four days. Add the three or four days’ ration that a soldier carries in his
pack, and bare subsistence for week will be assured.

supplies from distant areas whenever there is a halt. In that case it is
possible to switch at any time from being locally supplied to any other
system.

Local supply offers the immense advantage of being the quickest, and

needing no means of transport; but it does presuppose that under ordinary
circumstances all troops are quartered in local households.

battalion can generally camp close to a few villages, and these can be
directed to furnish supplies. This type of subsistence is essentially no
different from the first. Usually, however, a far larger force is likely to camp
in a single area, and in that case there is no alternative but for this major
unit—a brigade or a division—to requisition whatever is needed from the
surrounding area, and then distribute it.

One can see at a glance that this is no way of raising enough food for a

sizable army. The yield from stocks in the countryside will fall far short of
what the troops would get if they were quartered in the villages themselves;
for when 30 or 40 men move into a farm, they will clean it out if need be.
But an officer who is sent out with a few men with orders to exact
provisions has neither the time nor the means to find everything. There may
also be a shortage of transport, and so they will get only a fraction of what
is available. Moreover, troops in camp are so crowded into one place that
the area from which food can be gathered rapidly will not be able to supply
enough. What, after all, can be expected where 30,000 men are extorting
food within a range of 5 miles, or 15 to 20 square miles? Even that little

will often be impossible, since most of the nearby villages will have troops
billeted in them who will not give anything up. Finally, this method is the
least economical. Some units will get more than they can use, much of it
will go to waste, and so forth.

troops are not too numerous—say in the case of a division of 8,000 to
10,000 men. Even then it should be used only as a necessary evil.

as advance guards and outposts when their own side is advancing. They will
reach a point where no preparations could possibly have been made, and the
stocks collected for the rest of the army are usually too far away. The same
applies to mobile columns operating on their own, and to all cases where
neither time nor means for any other type of provisioning happen to be
available.

and the more time and circumstances permit a transition to this method of
supply, the better the results will be. Usually the problem is lack of time:
what the troops can get for themselves, they can get more quickly.

efficient way of feeding troops. It has been the basic method in all recent
wars.

cooperation of the local authorities. Food is no longer seized by force
wherever it is found, but is delivered in an orderly way, with the burden
reasonably distributed. Only the local authorities can do this.

Here time is of the essence: the more time, the wider the distribution, the

lighter the burden, and the more successful the operation. Supplies may
even be bought for cash, which comes close to the system of provisioning
that will be discussed next. Feeding troops by regular requisitions is no
problem when they are concentrated in their homeland; the same, as a rule,
is true of an army moving to the rear. On the other hand, all advances into a
region that is not one’s own will leave very little time for making such
arrangements—seldom more than the single day by which the advance
guard is ahead of the main force. The former presents the local authorities
with the requisitions, specifying the amounts and rations to be provided,
and where to deliver them. Since these can only be gathered from the

immediate area—that is, within a radius of a few miles from each delivery
point—stocks assembled in this hasty manner would not possibly suffice for
a good-size army unless it brought with it enough food for several days. It
is, therefore, the job of each commissariat to make do with what it receives,
and only issue food to units that have none. But every day will ease the
shortages. As the distances over which supplies are hauled daily grow
greater, so does the territory drawn upon, in terms of square miles. If only
100 square miles can be drawn upon the first day, there will be 400 the
second, and 900 the third; to put it another way, the second day’s area will
be larger than that of the first by 300 square miles, that of the third larger
still by another 500.

be many limiting factors, the main one being that the area which the army
has just left cannot make so significant a contribution as the rest. It must be
remembered, on the other hand, that the radius of food collection can be
extended by more than 10 miles every day—possibly by 15 or 20, or in
some areas even more.

executive power of individual detachments which are placed at the disposal
of the officials. Even more effective is the fear of being held responsible, of
being punished or maltreated—which, under such circumstances, acts as a
collective burden that weighs on the whole population.

Since, for our purposes, the result is all that matters, we do not intend to

go into details or examine the whole mechanism of commissariat and
supply.

and confirmed by the experiences of the wars since 1792, is that even the
largest army can safely rely on requisitions, provided it carries a few days’
rations with it. The requisitions are delivered upon arrival of the army; at
first only from the immediate neighborhood, as time goes on from an
expanding radius, the activity being organized and controlled by
increasingly senior authorities.

This method knows no limits other than the complete exhaustion,

impoverishment and devastation of the country. If an army stays for a
considerable length of time, the highest civil authorities will become
involved in running the system. They will, of course, do whatever they can

to spread the load and reduce the burden by purchases. Even belligerent
foreign forces that occupy a country for any length of time will hardly be so
harsh and pitiless as to place the whole burden of subsistence on the land.
Requisitioning, therefore, gradually tends to become increasingly like the
depot system, although that does not mean it ever ceases altogether, or that
its influence on military movements undergoes any notable change. It is one
thing to supplement local resources by supplies imported from a distance,
while the region itself remains the army’s chief supplier; it is quite another
to proceed as in eighteenth-century wars, when the army carried all
provisions with it and the countryside was as a rule left alone.

bakeries. They eliminate the enormous burden of wagon trains, which in
almost all cases tended to destroy its own labors.

Even today, of course, an army cannot do without some supply wagons

of its own, but the need is infinitely smaller. Such wagons are really used
only for making the surplus of one day’s food available for the next. Special
conditions, such as those of 1812 in Russia, will even now call for a
colossal wagon train, as well as the transport of field bakeries; but these are
to some extent exceptions. It is rare, after all, for an army of 300,000 men to
advance for 650 miles on practically a single road, to do it in countries such
as Poland and Russia, and just before the harvest. And even in such cases
the army’s own resources are considered to be only supplementary, while
local requisitions are treated as the basis of supply.

French armies since the first campaigns of the Revolutionary wars. Their
enemies were forced to adopt it as well, and one can hardly expect it ever to
be abandoned. No other system is as satisfactory, both in regard to the vigor
with which war can be waged, and to the ease and flexibility it confers.
Subsistence rarely causes any difficulty for the first three or four weeks, no
matter where the army goes, and after that supplementary depots will be
available; so one can truly say that war has gained the utmost liberty by
these arrangements. While there may be difficulties of one kind or another
that may influence planning, we will never be faced with an absolute
impossibility, and policy can never be dictated by considerations of supply
alone.

features coincide that have an adverse effect on subsistence. Movements are
continuous, usually without definite halts, and so there is no time for
gathering supplies. The very conditions that dictate the retreat will normally
be highly adverse, making it imperative to keep the troops continually
concentrated, which generally rules out any distribution in billets or any
considerable extension of the columns. In hostile territory it is not possible
to gather supplies by simply issuing orders; and finally, the situation
particularly favors resistance and ill will on the part of the local inhabitants.
The effect of all this is that in such cases one is strictly limited to
established lines of communication and retreat.

him to the road by which he had advanced: on any other he would
undoubtedly have come to grief even earlier. All the blame that has been
heaped upon him on this account, even by French writers, completely
misses the point.

4. Subsistence by means of depots. If a broad distinction were to be made

between this and the method previously discussed, we could only do so by
referring to the system that was used from the last thirty years of the
seventeenth to the end of the eighteenth century. Will such a system ever be
used again?

which large armies stayed in the same place for seven, ten, or twelve years
—as was the case in the Netherlands, the Rhineland, Northern Italy, Silesia
and Saxony. No country could remain the chief supply-agent for the
opposing armies for that length of time without being utterly ruined, and
gradually failing in its obligations.

system or is governed by it. We would answer that at first the supply system
will govern war insofar as the other governing factors will permit; but
where these start to offer too much resistance, the conduct of war will react
on the supply system and so dominate it.

Warfare based on requisition and local sources of supply is so superior to

the kind that relies on depots, that the two no longer seem to be the same
instrument. No government would dare oppose the first kind of warfare
with the second; if any minister of war were hidebound or ignorant enough

to misjudge the general needs of the situation and, at the opening of
hostilities, to provision his army by the old system, force of circumstances
would soon overpower his general. Requisitioning would automatically
impose itself. One has to remember that since no state ever has more money
than it needs, the high cost of maintaining depots will necessarily cut into
expenditure on the armament and the size of the army. It follows that there
is practically no chance of such arrangements being used, unless the two
belligerents were to arrive at a mutual agreement on the subject through
diplomatic channels—a possibility that must be considered pure fantasy.

Thus in future, all wars are more than likely to start out with a system of

requisitioning. How much either government will do to supplement it by
other arrangements so as to spare its rural population and so forth, may be
left open. It will probably not be much; priority is always given to the most
urgent needs at such a time, and a special supply organization is no longer
considered urgent.

Where, on the other hand, a war is not so decisive in its results, or not so

extensive in its movements, as its true nature would imply, requisitioning
will start to exhaust the area very seriously, to the point where one will be
forced either to make peace or to make arrangements for easing the burden
on the country by creating an independent supply system. The latter was
done by Bonaparte in Spain, but the former is more usual. In most wars the
exhaustion of the belligerents increases to such an extent that, instead of
making the war more expensive, they are driven to make peace. Here, too,
contemporary practice tends to shorten wars.

old method of supply. It may possibly occur again where it is indicated by
conditions on both sides, and where other favorable circumstances are
present. But its form can never be considered natural; it is an exception that
happens to be feasible, but that can never spring from the true concept of
war. Even less can it be considered a perfecting of warfare simply because
it is more humane. War itself is anything but humane.

Whichever method of supply is chosen, it will, of course, work better in a

rich, densely populated area than in a poor and uninhabited one. Density of
population affects the size of stocks in an area in two ways. First, where
consumption is high, it calls for large reserves; and second, a larger
population as a rule means greater production. An exception must of course

be made for areas inhabited chiefly by industrial workers, especially when
they happen to be in mountain valleys, surrounded by infertile areas, as is
not uncommon. Broadly speaking, however, it is far easier to meet an
army’s needs in a populous area than in a sparsely populated one. No matter
how rich the soil, an area of 10,000 square miles with 400,000 inhabitants
cannot support an army of 100,000 men so comfortably as one in which the
population numbers 2,000,000. Furthermore, in thickly populated areas
communications by land and water are better and more plentiful, means of
transport more abundant, and regular commercial links simpler and more
dependable. In short, it is far easier to feed an army in Flanders than in
Poland.

It follows that war, with its numerous tentacles, prefers to suck

nourishment from main roads, populous towns, fertile valleys traversed by
broad rivers, and busy coastal areas.

exert on the form and direction of operations, as well as the choice of a
theater of war and the lines of communication.

final analysis be attached to the ease or difficulty of supply—those are
questions that will naturally depend on how the war is to be conducted. If
war is to be waged in accordance with its essential spirit—with the
unbridled violence that lies at its core, the craving and need for battle and
decision—then feeding the troops, though important, is a secondary matter.
On the other hand, where a state of equilibrium has set in, in which troops
move back and forth for years in the same province, subsistence is likely to
become the principal concern. In that case, the quarter-master-general
becomes the supreme commander, and the conduct of war consists of
organizing the wagon trains.

Thus there are countless campaigns in which nothing happened, which

missed their goal and squandered their resources to no purpose, and the
excuse for it all was difficulties of supply. Bonaparte, on the other hand,
used to say, qu’on ne me parle pas des vivres!

In the Russian campaign, to be sure, he proved that such neglect can go

too far. We are not suggesting that as the only reason why the campaign
came to grief—that must be a matter of opinion. But it is undeniable that

the lack of care over supplies was responsible for the unprecedented
wastage of his army on the advance, and for its wholly calamitous retreat.

frequently took reckless risks, one must grant that he and the Revolutionary
generals before him disposed of some powerful prejudices about
maintaining an army in the field. They demonstrated that maintenance had
to be regarded as a condition of war, and never as its object.

Moreover, privation in time of war may be compared to danger and

physical exertion. There are no definite limits to the demands a general can
make of his troops. A strong-willed commander will ask more than one
ruled by delicate emotions; and an army’s performance will also depend on
the degree to which its willpower and endurance have been steeled by
familiarity with war, military spirit, trust in and devotion to the general, and
enthusiasm for the cause. Yet one can take it as a fundamental rule that
hardship and privation, no matter how extreme, must always be treated as a
temporary condition, which has to lead to a state of plenty—even at times
luxury. What can be more moving than the thought of thousands of soldiers,
poorly clad, their shoulders bent under thirty or forty pounds of equipment,
plodding along for days on end in every kind of weather and on every kind
of road, continuously endangering their health and their lives, without even
a crust of bread to nourish them? When one knows how often this happens
in war, one must marvel at the fact that heart and strength do not give out
more often, and at the way in which the power of an idea can, by its lasting
effect, summon up and support incredible exertions in human beings.

So if for the sake of great issues one imposes great privations on the

troops, one must bear in mind, whether prompted by sympathy or by
prudence, the reward owed them at a later time.

Finally, we have to examine the different ways in which attack and

defense will affect the problems of supply.

A defending army can always use supplies that it has been able to

stockpile in advance; so the defenders will not be lacking in necessities.
This is so especially for troops stationed in their own country, but it holds
true even in enemy territory. The attacker, on the other hand, leaves his
sources of supply behind, and so long as he is advancing and even for some
weeks after he has come to a halt, he has to shift for himself from one day

to the next. Under these conditions shortages and difficulties will be the
rule.

first occurs on the advance, before a decision has been reached. The
defender is in full possession of his stocks, whereas the attacker has had to
leave his own behind. He must keep his forces concentrated and therefore
cannot cover a wide area of country. Even his transport can no longer
follow him once movement into battle has begun. Unless thorough
preparations have been made by then, the troops may well begin to suffer
from shortages and actual hunger several days before they fight the decisive
battle. That is hardly a healthy way to lead them into action.

The second crisis most commonly occurs at the end of a victorious

campaign when the lines of communication have begun to be overstretched.
This is especially true when the war is conducted in an impoverished, thinly
populated and possibly hostile country. How vast a difference there is
between a supply line stretching from Vilna to Moscow, where every wagon
has to be procured by force, and a line from Cologne to Paris, via Liège,
Louvain, Brussels, Mons, Valenciennes and Cambrai, where a commercial
transaction, a bill of exchange, is enough to produce millions of rations!

this problem. Strength ebbs away, retreat becames unavoidable, and
gradually the signs of genuine defeat appear.

outset, as we have pointed out, it is the first to run short when the
countryside begins to be exhausted. Its bulk is so great that it is hardest to
procure from a distance, and a horse will perish from want much sooner
than a man. That is one of the reasons why too much cavalry and artillery
can be a real burden, and an actual source of weakness to an army.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

A stretch of enemy territory may also constitute an army’s base, or at any

rate part of it, for the area held by an invading force will meet a good many
of its needs; provided that the army truly controls the area and can be sure
that its orders will be obeyed. The range of that certainty seldom extends
beyond the rather limited methods of overawing the inhabitants by means of
small garrisons and mobile detachments. In enemy territory, therefore, the
area from which supplies can be obtained is small in relation to an army’s
needs, and seldom adequate. A great deal therefore has to be supplied from
home. Once more this means the area closest to the rear of the army, which
must be considered as an essential component of its base.

An army’s needs fall into two categories: those that any agricultural area

can provide, and those that can only be obtained from sources located to the
rear. The former are mostly provisions; the latter consist of replacements.

The former may to some degree be secured from occupied territory, but the
latter—men and weapons, for example, and usually munitions—can, for the
most part, only come from home. Exceptions may occur, but they will be
rare and insignificant; the distinction remains of great importance and
proves again that communications with the homeland are essential.

Food stores are normally kept in undefended towns, both in occupied

territory and at home, for there are never enough fortresses to hold these
very bulky stocks, which are rapidly consumed and needed in different
places at different times. Besides, food is easier to replace than stocks of the
army’s other needs such as weapons, ammunition, and equipment, which
are generally not kept in undefended places near the scene of war, but
preferably brought up from a distance. In enemy territory they have to be
kept in fortresses. This is further proof that the importance of the base rests
more on the need for replacements of weapons and equipment than on food
supplies.

depots, and the more the sources combine into great reservoirs, the more
these can be considered as substitutes for the country as a whole, and the
more the idea of the base will primarily refer to the places where these great
stores are kept. These locations themselves, on the other hand, must never
be mistaken for the base.

Where these sources of replacements and supplies are ample—in other

words, where there is a wide expanse of fertile land, where supplies have
been stored for greater efficiency in large, secure depots near the army,
linked to it by good roads, when depots are spaced over an extensive area to
the rear or even to some degree on the flanks of the army—then a more
vigorous existence will be generated for the army, as well as a great deal
more freedom for its movements. Attempts have been made to unite the
advantages of such a situation into a single concept: the dimensions of the
operational base. The attempt has been made to express the sum total of
advantages and disadvantages arising from the character of an army’s
sources of supply and replacements, by the relationship between the base
and the operational objective and the angle which the outer limits of the
base form with this objective (which was assumed to be a point).101 But it is
evident that this elegant piece of geometry is nothing but a toy: it rests on a

series of substitutions at the expense of truth. As we have shown, an army’s
base of operations is composed of the threefold gradations of its situation:
the local resources, depots at various points, and the area from which
supplies are drawn. These three factors are spatially distinct: they cannot be
reduced to one. Least of all can they be represented by a line which is
supposed to show the width of the base but which, as a rule, is arbitrarily
drawn between two fortresses or two provincial capitals or along a
country’s frontiers. Nor is it possible to define a fixed relationship between
the three tiers of the infrastructure, for in actual fact their natures to some
extent overlap. In one case, equipment that would otherwise have to be
brought from a great distance, can be procured locally; in another, even
foodstuffs have to be shipped from a distance. Sometimes the nearest
fortresses are major ports, arsenals, or commercial centers that contain the
war-potential of an entire State; at other times they consist merely of
primitive earthworks, barely adequate for their own defense.

In consequence all that has been deduced from the dimensions of the

operational base and the operational angle, and the whole theory of war that
was founded on them, insofar as it was geometrical, has been totally
ignored in actual warfare, and has given rise to misleading efforts in the
realm of theory. Since the basic facts were correct, and only the reasoning
from them was spurious, the same notions are occasionally likely to recur.

One cannot then do more, in our view, than recognize the general

influence of a base on military operations—the fact that it may be weak or
strong, and the factors that make it so. But one must also admit that there is
no way of reducing it to one or two simple propositions that will amount to
a useful rule; rather, each separate case requires that all the factors we have
mentioned must be simultaneously borne in mind.

given area, and for a definite operation, then even in one’s own country that
area alone can be considered as the army’s base. Since changes always call
for expenditure of time and effort, an army cannot shift its base overnight,
even in its own country. The directions of its operations are, therefore, to
some extent restricted. During operations in enemy territory one could treat
the common frontier in its entirety as the army’s base. This assumption
would be valid in a general sense since special arrangements could be made
everywhere along the frontier, but not for every particular instance because

such special arrangements are not in fact made everywhere. When the
Russian army retreated before the French at the start of the campaign of
1812, it could certainly regard the whole of Russia as its base, the more so
as the vast extent of Russia gave the army ample room in all directions.
This was in no way illusory; the concept came to life later, when other
Russian armies converged on the French from several sides. At any given
moment of the campaign, however, the base of the Russian army was not so
extensive as that. Actually, it was present mainly in the roads on which a
tremendous mass of army transport moved in both directions. This type of
limitation, for instance, prevented the Russian army, after three days’
fighting at Smolensk, from making their further retreat in a different
direction rather than toward Moscow. A move toward Kaluga, which had
been proposed in order to draw the French away from the capital, would
have constituted a change of plan that was impossible to execute without
having been prepared in advance.

intensity and scale with any increase in the army’s size; as is only natural.
An army is like a tree that draws its sustenance from the ground in which it
grows. A mere sapling is easy to transplant, but the taller it grows, the
harder this will become. A small detachment also has its channels of
sustenance, but unlike a large army it takes root easily wherever it may be.
So when one talks about the influence that the base exerts on operations, the
size of the army must be the standard by which each factor is measured.

important for immediate needs; but, for an army’s general existence over a
period of time, the flow of men and equipment is more important. The latter
can only come from certain sources, while the former may be obtained in a
number of ways—a fact that further explains the influence that a base exerts
on operations.

is among those that take time to produce a decisive effect. There is always
the question, what is to be done in the meantime. The value of an
operational base, therefore, will rarely predetermine the choice of an
operation: it will do so only where the impossible is demanded. The
ordinary difficulties that may arise in this respect will have to be considered

in conjunction and comparison with the other means available. Obstacles of
this nature tend to vanish in the face of decisive victories.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

In the previous chapter we pointed out that an army, despite the present

system of procuring supplies chiefly from the area in which it is stationed,
must still be regarded as forming a unity with its operational base. The lines
of communication are part of that unity. They link the army to its base, and
must be considered as its arteries. The roads are in constant use for all sorts
of deliveries, for ammunition convoys, detachments moving back and forth,
mail carriers and couriers, hospitals and depots, reserve munitions, and
administrative personnel. All this together is vital to the army.

These arteries, then, must not be permanently cut, nor must they be too

long or difficult to use. A long road always means a certain waste of
strength, which tends to cripple the condition of the army.

In their other role, as lines of retreat, they are in effect the strategic rear

of the army.

For both purposes, the value of the roads depends on their length, their

number, and their orientation (their general direction and the direction in
which they run where they are close to the army); their state; the difficulties
of the terrain; the condition and temper of the local inhabitants; and finally
the amount of cover given them by fortresses or natural barriers.

Not all the roads or tracks that lead from the army to the sources of its

life and strength can be counted as lines of communication. No doubt they
can all be used as such and ranked as supplementary to the system; but the
system itself comprises only roads on which military services have been
established. The only true lines of communication are those on which

depots and hospitals, relay points and postal services, as well as
commandants, field police and garrisons have been installed. At this point
the very important and frequently ignored difference must be noted that
exists between an army at home and one in enemy territory. Lines of
communication will, of course, have been set up at home, but the army is
not necessarily tied to them; if need be, it can leave them and use any road
available. After all, it is at home everywhere; it can everywhere rely on its
own officials, and is everywhere received with goodwill. While other roads
may not be so good, and may not suit the army’s needs so well, they can at
least be used; if the army’s position is turned, or if it has to change its front,
these roads will not be considered impossible to use. In enemy territory, on
the other hand, the only lines of communication on which an army can
usually rely are the roads on which it advanced in the first place, and small
and almost insignificant causes may here make a considerable difference.

essential lines of communication. Its presence may inspire fear and terror,
but its measures may assume the character of inexorable necessity in the
eyes of the inhabitants, who may even be persuaded to consider them as an
amelioration of the general evil of war. Small garrisons set up here and
there will maintain and reinforce this general system. If, on the other hand,
commissaries, commandants, police, security posts and administrative
personnel were to be dispatched along some distant road not used by the
army, the local inhabitants would regard this as an unnecessary burden.
Unless some shattering defeat or disaster had reduced the country to a state
of panic, these officials would be treated with hostility, beaten up, and
thrown out. In order to secure the new road, one would above all need
garrisons, and these would have to be larger than normal; and the risk
would still remain that the local population would try to resist. In brief, an
army advancing into enemy territory is not equipped to command
obedience. It has first to install its own administration and must do so by the
authority of its arms. This is not possible everywhere and at once; it
demands sacrifices and poses difficulties. It follows that in enemy territory
an army is even less able to switch from one base to another by changing its
communications system than it is at home, where this is at least possible.
The effect, in general, will be a greater limitation on mobility and a greater
vulnerability to envelopment.

limited by a number of conditions. Not only must they as a rule follow
major roads, but in general they will be better the wider the roads, the larger
and wealthier the towns they link, and the more numerous the fortresses that
cover them. The choice is also much affected by rivers as a means of
transport, and bridges as points of passage. Thus, the position of lines of
communication and, hence, the route an invading army can use are matters
of free choice only up to a certain point; their exact location is determined
by the facts of geography.

It is the sum of these factors that renders the army’s communications

with its base strong or weak. The result compared with the enemy’s
situation determines which of the two sides is better placed to cut the
other’s lines of communication or even of retreat, or, to use the technical
phrase, to envelop him. Quite apart from psychological or physical
superiority, it can, in effect, only be done by the side that has the superior
lines of communication. Otherwise the enemy will soon retaliate.

Just as the roads are made to serve two purposes, the enveloping or

turning movement may have two objectives. It may aim at disrupting, or
cutting, communications, causing the army to wither and die, and thus be
forced to retreat; or it may aim at cutting off the retreat itself.

As to the first objective, one should bear in mind that, with armies

supplied as they are today, a brief disruption is rarely serious; indeed, a
certain amount of time will elapse before minor individual losses will
amount to anything significant. In the past, the artificial system of supply
meant thousands of wagons moving to and fro. A single flanking operation
could shatter it. Today an operation of that sort, however well it might
succeed, would not have any noticeable effect. At best it might capture a
single convoy and cause some local inconvenience; but it would not
necessitate a retreat.

in the field, have thus become still less practicable. They can be considered
dangerous only to very long and vulnerable lines of communication, whose
chief weakness, however, lies in their being always and everywhere
exposed to attacks by an insurgent population.

As for an army’s retreat being cut off, the threat of narrowed or

endangered lines of retreat should likewise not be overrated. Recent

experience has made it plain that where the troops are good and their
commanders bold they are more likely to break through than be trapped.

lines of communication. One can mitigate the situation somewhat by taking
some fortresses near the army’s position and on the roads that lead back
from it, or, where there are no fortresses, by fortifying appropriate points;
by treating the population well, keeping strict discipline on military roads,
policing the area thoroughly, and constantly keeping the roads in repair. But
the risks can never be entirely eliminated.

which armies should travel if at all possible, applies particularly to the lines
of communication. The widest roads running through the wealthiest cities
and the richest agricultural areas are the best lines of communication. They
are preferable even where they involve considerable detours, and in most
cases it is they that determine the specific dispositions of the army’s
deployment.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

Their principal effect lies in the realm of tactics, but the outcome is a

matter of strategy. An engagement in the mountains is in itself and in its
consequences quite different from one on the plains.

and examined both closely, we cannot properly consider the salient features
of terrain as to their effect; for the present we shall have to confine
ourselves to their general characteristics. Geography and ground can affect
military operations in three ways: as an obstacle to the approach, as an
impediment to visibility, and as cover from fire. All other properties can be
traced back to these three.

Undoubtedly this threefold effect of terrain tends to make military

activity more varied, complex and skillful, because it introduces three
additional elements into the combination.

The idea of an absolute and completely level plain—in other words

completely passive ground—actually exists only for very small
detachments, and even then only for the duration of a particular episode.
But in the case of larger units and of longer periods of time, the physical
characteristics of the ground influence the action. When it comes to full-
scale armies one can hardly think of a single phase—a battle, for example—
where the influence of geography would not be felt.

This influence is thus always active; its degree varies according to the

nature of the country.

distinct ways in which an area may differ from the concept of a flat and
open plain: first in the contours of the countryside, such as its hills and
valleys; second in such natural phenomena as forests, swamps and lakes;
and third in the factors produced by agriculture. Each of these ways
contributes to the influence that geography exerts on military operations. If
we further analyze these three types, we shall be able to define them as
mountainous country, sparsely cultivated forests and marshlands, and
agricultural areas. All three will tend to make warfare more complicated
and ingenious.

Not all types of cultivation, naturally, have the same effect. It is strongest

in Flanders, Holstein, and other areas, where the land is cut up by numerous
ditches, fences, hedges, and walls, and dotted with great numbers of single
houses and clumps of trees.

areas. But this holds true only in general and altogether disregards the value
of natural obstacles to the defense.

obstacle to access and to visibility, and as a means of cover.

In wooded country the dominant impediment is to visibility; in

mountainous country it is to access; in intensively cultivated areas, both
may exist to some degree.

Military movements are practically impossible in heavily wooded

country, since the difficulty of access as well as the complete lack of
visibility will not permit all modes of traversing it. Thus in one way it
simplifies the very action that it complicates in another. For while it is more
difficult to concentrate one’s forces for an engagement in such terrain, it
will not be necessary to split up into so many parts as it would be in
mountains or in heavily intersected areas—in other words, in wooded areas
a division of forces will be harder to avoid, but it will not have to be so
extensive.

In mountainous areas the problem of access dominates, and it is effective

in two ways: one can only penetrate at certain points and not at others; and
where it is possible at all, movement is slower and more laborious. Thus,
the impetus of all movements will diminish in mountains, and any
maneuver will take more time. Moreover, mountainous terrain has the

particular characteristic that one point dominates another. The command of
high ground in general is a subject we shall deal with in the following
chapter. At this stage, we only wish to point out that it is this peculiarity of
mountains that causes troops to be split up to so great an extent. High points
are important not only for their own sake, but for the effect they have on
one another.

As each type of terrain approaches its extreme it will, as we have

observed elsewhere, tend to reduce a general’s influence on events to the
same degree to which it tends to emphasize the personal resources of the
ranks, down to the private soldier. The more the forces are divided, the less
they can be controlled, and obviously the more each man is on his own. It is
of course true that as operations become more and more fragmented, more
diversified and specialized, the role of intelligence will in general have to
increase, and the supreme commander himself will have more chance of
showing superior ability. But at this time we must repeat a point we have
made before: in war, the sum total of individual successes is more decisive
than the pattern that connects them. Thus if we pursue the present argument
to its extreme and imagine an army deployed in a single firing line so that
every soldier fights as it were a private battle, more will clearly depend on
the sum of individual victories than on their pattern. After all, the
effectiveness of favorable combinations can only be the result of success,
and never of failure; so in this case the courage, skill and spirit of the
individual will be the decisive factor. Only in cases in which the two armies
are of equal quality, or where their special virtues cancel each other out, can
the talent and insight of the supreme commander again become paramount.
It follows that truly national wars with a population in arms, and similar
circumstances that generally raise the military spirit of the individual (if not
necessarily his courage and skill) will tend to succeed where their forces
have to be scattered—in other words, where they are favored by heavily
uneven and obstructed terrain. But they can exist only in this type of
country; their nature usually denies them the qualities and virtues that are
vital to concerted action by even moderately substantial forces.

Between the extremes there are many gradations in the nature of the

fighting forces. Even a standing professional army will develop something
of a national army’s qualities when defending its native soil, which will
permit greater independence of action.

army, and the more pronounced they are on the other side, the more this
army will fear fragmentation and the more it will tend to avoid rough
country. But this is seldom a matter of choice: one cannot choose a theater
of operations by trying it out as if it were merchandise. Hence troops that
are by nature at an advantage when fighting as a concentrated mass, will
exert their efforts to the utmost in order to use this system as far as it is at
all possible, in spite of the nature of the terrain. They will thereby be
exposed to other disadvantages, such as difficulties of supply and poor
billets; and in action they will be exposed to frequent flank attacks. But they
would pay an even greater penalty if they were to give up their own special
advantages.

These two opposite tendencies—toward concentration and toward

dispersal—normally follow the natural bias of the troops themselves. Still,
even in the most unequivocal of cases, it will be as impossible for one side
always to remain concentrated, as it will be for the other to count on success
simply by always operating in open order. In Spain even the French were
forced to disperse their strength, and although the Spaniards fought as
insurgents in defense of their native soil they were still forced to hazard
some of their strength in major battles.

The influence that the terrain brings to bear upon the general, and

particularly the political composition of the fighting forces, is closely
followed in importance by its influence on the ratio between the arms of the
services.

or the type of cultivation—a sizeable cavalry is plainly useless. The same
applies to artillery in wooded areas, which seldom offer enough space for
the effective use of guns or roads to move them on or forage for the horses.
Closely cultivated areas are less of a handicap for artillery, and mountains
least of all. Both, of course, provide cover from its fire, and are therefore
not favorable to an arm whose chief effect is fire; what is more, heavy guns
are frequently endangered by enemy infantry, for infantry can penetrate
anywhere. On the other hand, neither type of terrain will be exactly lacking
in the space required by a large amount of artillery, and in the mountains
artillery also has the enormous advantage of the slowness of the enemy’s
movements, which adds to its effectiveness.

But it cannot be doubted that in difficult terrain of any kind infantry is the

clearly superior arm. In such areas therefore its numbers should be
permitted considerably to exceed the normal ratio.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

Physical force is always harder to exert in an upward than in a downward

direction, and this must also hold true of an engagement. We can cite three
obvious reasons. First of all, high ground always inhibits the approach;
second, though it does not add perceptibly to range, shooting downward,
considering all the geometrical relations involved, is perceptibly more
accurate than shooting upward; and third, heights command a wider view.
How all these factors combine during the engagement will not concern us
here. We shall simply take the sum of the tactical advantages conferred by
height and call it the first strategic benefit.

The first and third of these advantages will also arise in a strategic

context. Marching and reconnaissance are as much a part of strategy as of
tactics. Hence, if a position on higher ground prevents the approach of a
force located lower down, it constitutes the second advantage that accrues
to strategy. The wider view that high ground affords is the third.

In these elements lies the strength of positions that dominate, survey,

command. They are the source of superiority and security for the side that
looks down from a mountain ridge at the enemy below, and of inferiority
and apprehension for the latter. Possibly this overall impression is greater
than it ought to be: the advantages of higher ground impress the mind more
acutely than the circumstances that modify them. The impression may,
therefore, exceed the facts, in which case this trick of the imagination must

be counted as an additional element that reinforces the effect of holding
high ground.

always lie with the side that holds the higher ground. It only does so if the
other side intends to attack. Height is no asset if a wide valley lies between
the two, and indeed it can favor the side on lower ground if both sides
intend to fight an action in the plains—as they did at the battle of
Hohenfriedberg. The advantage of a wider view also has definite
limitations; it will do no good where the lower ground is wooded, or where
part of the view is blocked by the very mountain range on which one is
located. There are innumerable cases where one searches the area in vain
for the advantageous high points one had located on the map; instead, one
often seems to get involved in their very disadvantages. Still, these
limitations and conditions will not cancel out the advantages that derive
from higher ground, for both defense and attack. We shall briefly show how
this applies in either case.

High ground offers .three strategic assets: greater tactical strength,

protection from access, and a wider view. The first two, by their nature,
accrue only to the defense; they can be used only by the side that stands still
—the side that moves cannot take advantage of them. The third advantage
may be used by the attack as well as by the defense.

situations. Since high ground is attainable only by taking up positions in
mountainous areas, one might conclude that these would constitute a great
advantage for the defense. It may turn out to be different in reality, as the
chapter on defense in mountainous areas will show.

We must in any case make a general distinction. When it is simply a

matter of high ground at a single point—at one position, for example—the
strategic benefit tends to merge with the simple tactical benefit of a good
position for a battle. If, on the other hand, one imagines a substantial tract
of land—a province, say—as a sloping plain, a general watershed, one
expands the strategic benefit by being able to move in several directions
while still retaining one’s elevation above the surrounding country. In that
case, one will profit by the advantage of higher ground, not only through a
combination of forces in the single engagement but also through a

combination of a series of engagements which form a whole. So much for
defense.

As for the attack, to some extent it enjoys the same advantages that

height confers on defense, for a strategic attack, unlike a tactical one, is not
a single action. The attacker’s progress is not continuous, like that of a
machine, but consists of a number of separate marches, with intervals of
varying length between them. At every rest stop the attacker is as much on
the defensive as his opponent.

The advantage of a better view means that higher ground confers a

certain offensive power on both attack and defense, which calls for some
attention: it is the ease with which one can operate in isolated detachments.
The advantages that an elevated location give to the whole will also accrue
to each of its parts. An isolated group, whether large or small, can wield
more power than it would otherwise possess, and is less exposed to risk in
taking up a position than it would be without the benefit of height. How
such isolated detachments can best be used will be discussed elsewhere.

If a location on high ground is combined with other geographical

advantages in relation to one’s opponent, if the latter is limited in his
movements by other factors, such as the proximity of a major river, for
instance, the drawbacks of his situation will appear so decisive as to make
him want to withdraw as quickly as possible. No army is capable of
maintaining a position in the valley of a major river if it does not command
the surrounding heights.

The occupation of high ground can thus mean genuine domination. Its

reality is undeniable. But when all is said and done, such expressions as “a
dominating area,” “a covering position,” and “key to the country” are,
insofar as they refer to the nature of higher or lower ground, for the most
part hollow shells lacking any sound core. These elegant elements of theory
have been used above all as seasoning for the apparently overly plain
military fare. They are the favorite topics of academic soldiers and the
magic wands of armchair strategists. Neither the emptiness of such fantasies
nor the contradictions of experience have been able to convince these
authors and their readers that they were, in effect, pouring water into the
leaky vessel of the Danaides. Conditions have been mistaken for the thing
itself, the tool for the hand that wields it. Mere occupation of such an area
and position is taken for a show of strength, for a thrust or a blow, and the

area and the position for an active element. In reality, the occupation is
nothing but a raised arm, and the position itself only a lifeless tool, a mere
potentiality that needs an object for its realization, a simple plus or minus
sign without any value attached. The real thrust and blow, the object, the
value is victory in battle. It is the only thing that really counts and can be
counted on, and one must always bear it in mind, whether it be in passing
judgment in books or in taking action in the field.

If the decision depends only on the number and scale of victories, it

becomes obvious that the first consideration is the relative quality of the
two armies and their commanders. Terrain can only play a minor role.

BOOK SIX

1. THE CONCEPT OF DEFENSE

OceanofPDF.com

2. ADVANTAGES OF DEFENSE

Having outlined these general concepts, we now turn to the substance.
Tactically, every engagement, large or small, is defensive if we leave the

initiative to our opponent and await his appearance before our lines. From
that moment on we can employ all offensive means without losing the
advantages of the defensive—that is to say the advantages of waiting and
the advantages of position. At the strategic level the campaign replaces the
engagement and the theater of operations takes the place of the position. At
the next stage, the war as a whole replaces the campaign, and the whole
country the theater of operations. In both cases, defense remains the same
as at the tactical level.

We have already indicated in general terms that defense is easier than

attack. But defense has a passive purpose: preservation; and attack a
positive one: conquest. The latter increases one’s own capacity to wage
war; the former does not. So in order to state the relationship precisely, we
must say that the defensive form of warfare is intrinsically stronger than the
offensive. This is the point we have been trying to make, for although it is

implicit in the nature of the matter and experience has confirmed it again
and again, it is at odds with prevalent opinion, which proves how ideas can
be confused by superficial writers.

If defense is the stronger form of war, yet has a negative object, it follows

that it should be used only so long as weakness compels, and be abandoned
as soon as we are strong enough to pursue a positive object. When one has
used defensive measures successfully, a more favorable balance of strength
is usually created; thus, the natural course in war is to begin defensively and
end by attacking. It would therefore contradict the very idea of war to
regard defense as its final purpose, just as it would to regard the passive
nature of defense not only as inherent in the whole but also in all its parts.
In other words, a war in which victories were used only defensively without
the intention of counterattacking would be as absurd as a battle in which the
principle of absolute defense—passivity, that is—were to dictate every
action.

examples of wars in which the ultimate purpose of defense was purely
defensive, without any thought being given to a counteroffensive. This line
of argument would be possible if one forgot that a general concept is under
discussion. The examples that could be cited to prove the opposite must all
be classed as cases in which the possibility of a counteroffensive had not
yet arisen.

of taking the offensive, at least not in its final three years. Indeed, we
believe that in this war he always regarded offensives solely as a better
means of defense. This attitude was dictated by the general situation; and it
is natural for a commander to concentrate only on his immediate needs.
Nevertheless one cannot look at this example of defense on a grand scale
without speculating that the idea of a possible counteroffensive against
Austria may have been at the root of it, and conclude that the time for such
a move had not yet come. The peace that was concluded proves that this
was not an empty assumption: What else could have induced the Austrians
to make peace but the thought that their forces could not on their own
outweigh the genius of the King; that in any case they would have to
increase their efforts; and that any relaxation was almost bound to cost them
further territory? And, indeed, is there any doubt that Frederick would have

tried to crush the Austrians in Bohemia and Moravia again if Russia,
Sweden, and the Army of the Empire had not diverted his energies?

limits, we return once more to our claim that defense is the stronger form of
waging war.

beyond all doubt. For the present, we shall merely indicate the
inconsistencies the opposite view involves when tested by experience. If
attack were the stronger form, there would be no case for using the
defensive, since its purpose is only passive. No one would want to do
anything but attack: defense would be pointless. Conversely, it is natural
that the greater object is bought by greater sacrifice. Anyone who believes
himself strong enough to employ the weaker form, attack, can have the
higher aim in mind; the lower aim can only be chosen by those who need to
take advantage of the stronger form, defense. Experience shows that, given
two theaters of operations, it is practically unknown for the weaker army to
attack and the stronger stay on the defensive. The opposite has always
happened everywhere, and amply proves that commanders accept defense
as the stronger form, even when they personally would rather attack.

Some related points remain to be discussed in the following chapters.

At this stage we are not concerned with numerical superiority, courage,

training, or other qualities of an army. All of these as a rule depend on
matters beyond that part of the art of war we are concerned with here; in
any case their bearing would be the same on attack and defense. Even
general superiority of numbers is not relevant, since numbers, too, are
usually a given quantity in which a commander has no say. Moreover, these
matters have no special bearing on attack and defense. Only three things
seem to us to produce decisive advantages: surprise, the benefit of terrain,
and concentric attack.

Surprise becomes effective when we suddenly face the enemy at one

point with far more troops than he expected. This type of numerical
superiority is quite distinct from numerical superiority in general: it is the
most powerful medium in the art of war. The ways in which the advantage
of terrain contributes toward victory are fairly obvious. But it should be
noted that this is more than a matter of obstacles to an attack—steep slopes,
high mountains, marshy streams, hedges, and the like. Terrain may be just
as useful by enabling us to hold a concealed position; even a featureless
landscape can provide some advantage to those familiar with it. Concentric
attack comprises all tactical envelopment, great or small; its effectiveness is
produced partly by the double effectiveness of cross fire, and partly by the
fear of being cut off.

What is the relationship of attack and defense to these matters?
Bearing in mind the three elements of victory already described, the

answer must be this: the attacker is favored by only a small part of the first
and third factors while their larger part, and the second factor exclusively,
are available to the defender.

The one advantage the attacker possesses is that he is free to strike at any

point along the whole line of defense, and in full force: the defender, on the
other hand, is able to surprise his opponent constantly throughout the
engagement by the strength and direction of his counterattacks.

it off than it is for the defender: the latter is tied to his position and has
thereby presented the attacker with an objective. But the attacker’s
envelopment and its advantage is applicable only to the whole position, for
in the course of the engagement, it is easier for the defender to attack
segments of the opposite force concentrically; for as we have already said,
the defender is better placed to spring surprise by the strength and direction
of his own attacks.

terrain. His superior ability to produce surprise by virtue of the strength and
direction of his own attack stems from the fact that the attack has to
approach on roads and paths on which it can easily be observed; the
defender’s position, on the other hand, is concealed and virtually invisible
to his opponent until the decisive moment arrives. Ever since the right
method of defense was adopted, reconnaissance has gone out of fashion—
or, rather, it has become impossible. Some reconnaissance is still carried out
now and again, but as a rule nothing much comes of it. And yet, no matter
how great the advantage of being free to choose the ground for a position
and become familiar with it before the action, and no matter how plain it is
that the defender in the concealed position he has selected is bound to cause
far more surprise than the attacker, the older view persists: a battle accepted
is regarded as already half lost. This stems from the type of defense that
was practiced twenty years ago and to some extent in the Seven Years War
as well. In those days the only kind of advantage looked for in terrain was
that the front had to be difficult to approach (because of steep slopes, etc.).
The shallowness of the positions and the difficulties of maneuvering one’s
flanks made armies so weak that they had to dodge each other from hill to
hill and so made things even worse. Once some kind of support had been
secured, the army was stretched as tight as on an embroidery frame: all
depended on its not being pierced. The defended terrain was considered
valuable for its own sake, and so had to be defended at all points. Thus
movement or surprise in battle were out of the question. This was the

complete opposite of what a good defense can be, and in fact has been in
the recent past.

become obsolescent; that is what happened in the case described above. In
its day this method of defense really had been superior to the attack.

If we survey the development of modern war, we find that at the

beginning—in the Thirty Years War and the War of the Spanish Succession
—an army’s deployment and disposition was one of the main elements in a
battle. It was the most important part of the plan of action. This normally
worked to the advantage of the defender because his forces were deployed
and in position from the start. With the troops’ increased ability to
maneuver, this advantage was lost, and for a time the attack gained the
upper hand. The defender now sought protection behind rivers or deep
valleys, or on mountains. He thus recovered a distinct advantage, which
lasted until the attacker became so mobile and so skilled that he could
venture even into rough country and attack in separate columns; which
enabled him to turn the enemy. This led to greater and greater extension of
the line of battle until it naturally occurred to the attacker to concentrate on
a limited number of points and pierce the enemy’s shallow position. Thus
the offensive gained the upper hand for the third time, and once again the
defensive had to change its methods. That is what happened in the recent
wars. Forces were kept concentrated in large masses, most of them not
deployed and, wherever possible, in concealed positions. The object was
simply to be ready to deal with the attack as soon as its intentions became
clear.

This does not entirely preclude defending one’s ground in a partly

passive manner, for to do so offers such decisive advantages that it is
frequently done in the course of a campaign. But usually the passive
defense of terrain is no longer dominant—which is all we are concerned
with here.

If the offensive were to invent some major new expedient—which is

unlikely in view of the simplicity and inherent necessity that marks
everything today—the defensive will also have to change its methods. But
it will always be certain of having the benefit of terrain, and this will
generally ensure its natural superiority; for today the peculiarities of the

topography and the ground have a greater effect on military action than
ever.

As we have said before, in strategy there is no such thing as victory. Part

of strategic success lies in timely preparation for a tactical victory; the
greater the strategic success, the greater the likelihood of a victorious
engagement. The rest of strategic success lies in the exploitation of a
victory won. The more strategy has been able, through its ingenuity, to
exploit a victorious battle; the more that it can wrest out of the collapsing
edifice whose foundations have been shattered by the action; the more
completely the fruits of the hard-won victory can be harvested; then the
greater the success. The main factors responsible for bringing about or
facilitating such a success—thus the main factors in strategic effectiveness
—are the following:

1. The advantage of terrain
2. Surprise—either by actual assault or by deploying unexpected strength

at certain points

3. Concentric attack (all three as in tactics)
4. Strengthening the theater of operations, by fortresses, with all they

involve

5. Popular support
6. The exploitation of moral factors.102

 
What is the relationship of attack and defense with regard to these

factors?

In strategy as well as in tactics, the defense enjoys the advantage of

terrain, while the attack has the advantage of initiative.103 As regards
surprise and initiative, however, it must be noted that they are infinitely
more important and effective in strategy than in tactics. Tactical initiative

can rarely be expanded into a major victory, but a strategic one has often
brought the whole war to an end at a stroke. On the other hand, the use of
this device assumes major, decisive, and exceptional mistakes on the
enemy’s part. Consequently it will not do much to tip the scales in favor of
attack.

Surprising the enemy by concentrating superior strength at certain points

is again comparable to the analogous case in tactics. If the defender were
compelled to spread his forces over several points of access, the attacker
would obviously reap the advantage of being able to throw his full strength
against any one of them.

Here too the new system of defense has, by its new approach,

imperceptibly introduced new principles. Where the defender has no reason
to fear that his opponent will be able by advancing along an undefended
road to seize an important depot or munitions dump, or take a fortress
unawares, or even the capital unawares; where, therefore, he is not forced to
attack the enemy on the road chosen by the latter in order to avoid having
his retreat cut off; then there is no reason for him to split his forces. If the
attacker chooses a road on which he does not expect to meet the defender,
the latter can still seek him out there with his entire strength a few days
later. Indeed he can be sure that in most cases the attacker himself will
oblige him by seeking him out. But if for some reason the attacker has to
advance with divided forces—and problems of supply often leave him little
choice—the defender obviously reaps the benefit of being able to attack a
part of his opponent with his own full strength.

In strategy, the nature of flank and rear attacks on a theater of operations

changes to a significant degree.

1. The effect of cross fire is eliminated, since one cannot fire from one

end of a theater of operations to the other.

2. There is less fear of being cut off, since whole areas cannot be sealed

off in strategy as they can in tactics.

3. Because of the greater areas involved in strategy, the effectiveness of

interior and therefore shorter lines is accentuated and forms an
important counterbalance against concentric attacks.

4. A new factor emerges in the vulnerability of lines of communication,

that is, in the consequences of their being cut.

 
Because of the greater areas involved in strategy, envelopment or

concentric attack will of course only be possible for the side which takes the
initiative—in other words, the attacker. The defender cannot, as he can in
tactics, surround the surrounder in turn, for he cannot deploy his troops in
the relative depth required, nor keep them sufficiently concealed. But what
use to the attack is ease of envelopment if its rewards do not materialize? In
strategy, therefore, there would be no justification at all in putting forward
the enveloping attack as a means of victory, were it not for its effect on lines
of communication. Yet this is seldom an important factor at the earliest
stage when attack is first confronted by defense, and the two sides face each
other in their opening positions. It only begins to tell in the course of a
campaign, when the attacker, in enemy territory, gradually becomes the
defender. At that point the new defender finds his lines of communication
weakening, and the original defender can exploit that weakness once he has
taken the offensive. But it must be obvious that as a rule the defender
deserves no credit for this advantage, since it really derives from the
principles inherent in the defense itself.

The fourth element, the advantages of the theater of operations, naturally

benefit the defender. By initiating the campaign, the attacking army cuts
itself off from its own theater of operations, and suffers by having to leave
its fortresses and depots behind. The larger the area of operations that it
must traverse, the more it is weakened—by the effect of marches and by the
detachment of garrisons. The defending army, on the other hand, remains
intact. It benefits from its fortresses, nothing depletes its strength, and it is
closer to its sources of supply.

The support of the population, the fifth principle, will not necessarily

apply to every defense; a defensive campaign may be fought in enemy
territory. Still, this element derives from the concept of defense alone, and it
is applicable in the vast majority of cases. What is meant is primarily (but
not exclusively) the effectiveness of militia, and arming the population.
Furthermore, every kind of friction is reduced, and every source of supply
is nearer and more abundant.

The campaign of 1812 will here serve as a magnifying glass, for it clearly

reveals how the third and fourth of these factors can operate. Half a million

men crossed the Niemen; only 120,000 fought at Borodino, and still fewer
reached Moscow.

One may say indeed that the outcome of this enormous effort was so

great that even if the Russians had not followed it up with their own
counteroffensive, they would have been secure from any fresh invasion for
a long time to come. Of course no European country, except for Sweden, is
in a similar position to Russia’s; but the principle is universal and differs
only in degree.

As to the fourth and fifth factors, one might add that these assets pertain

to the basic case of defense in one’s own country. If defense is moved to
enemy soil and gets involved in offensive operations, it will be transformed
into a further liability of the offensive, in much the same way as with the
third element mentioned above. The offensive is not composed of active
elements alone, any more than the defensive is made up solely of passive
elements. Indeed, any attack that does not immediately lead to peace must
end on the defensive.

Thus, if all elements of defense that occur during an offensive are

weakened by the very fact that they are part of the offensive, then we must
regard this as another general liability pertaining to it.

disadvantage of all offensive action. Hence when a strategic attack is being
planned one should from the start give very close attention to this point—
namely, the defensive that will follow. The matter will be discussed in
greater detail in the book on strategic planning.

The important moral forces that sometimes permeate war like a leaven

may occasionally be used by a commander to invigorate his troops. These
forces may be found on the side of defense as well as that of attack; at least
one can say that the ones which especially favor attack, such as panic and
confusion in the enemy’s ranks, do not normally emerge until after the
decisive blow has been struck, and so seldom have much bearing on its
course.

All this should suffice to justify our proposition that defense is a stronger

form of war than attack. But we still have to mention a minor factor that so
far has been left out of account. It is courage: the army’s sense of
superiority that springs from the awareness that one is taking the initiative.
This affinity is a real one, but it is soon overlaid by the stronger and more

general spirit that an army derives from its victories or defeats, and by the
talent or incompetence of its commander.

It is assumed in both tactics and strategy that defense is a state of

expectation—that is to say, immobile—whereas the attacker is in motion—
relative, that is, to the defender’s immobility. It follows automatically that
turning and enveloping are methods available to the attacker only so long as
his movement and the immobility of the defense persist. This option of
moving convergently or not—depending on whether or not it is in the
attacker’s interest—would have to be counted as one of his advantages. But
the freedom of choice is available only in tactics, not always in strategy. In
the former the points on which the flanks rest hardly ever provide the kind
of absolute security that they frequently do in strategy, where the line of
defense may run from sea to sea or from one neutral country to another. In
this case, there can be no convergent attack; freedom of choice is limited. It
is even more awkwardly limited where the attack has to be convergent.
Russia and France cannot attack Germany in any other way than by
convergent movements; they can never attack with united forces. So if the
convergent use of forces is assumed to be the less effective in the majority
of cases, the benefit the attacker usually gets from greater freedom of

choice is probably nullified by the fact that in other cases he is forced to use
the less effective form.

closely.

center, the fact that they converge as they advance has been considered a
major advantage. The fact is true enough, but the presumed advantage is
not; because convergence takes place on both sides, and they therefore
cancel each other out. Where movement is from the center outward, the
same is true of divergence.

convergent lines direct their effectiveness toward a common destination,
while divergent lines do not. What, then, are these effects? Here we must
distinguish between tactics and strategy.

the following points as the advantages of these effects:

1. The doubled, or at least intensified, effect of cross fire, once a given

degree of convergence has been reached

2. Convergent attack on a single force
3. Cutting off the retreat.
 
Cutting off a retreat is possible in strategy as well, but it is obviously

much harder because the greater areas involved are not very easily sealed
off. Generally speaking a concentric attack on part of a force will gain in
weight and decisiveness the smaller the force attacked and the closer it
comes to the absolute minimum—viz., a single soldier. An army can fight
quite well on several fronts; a division less so; and a battalion only in close
order. A single man can do nothing at all. Strategy is concerned with major
bodies of troops, wide areas and substantial lengths of time; tactics with the
opposite. It follows that a convergent attack cannot have the same effect in
strategy as in tactics.

The effect of cross fire is not relevant to strategy at all; its place is taken

by another factor—the alarm that every army experiences to some degree
when the enemy is victorious in its rear, however far or near he may be.

A works also upon B without detracting from the effect on A; while its
effect on B works likewise upon A. The sum is therefore not A + B, but
something more; and this is an advantage that occurs both in tactics and in
strategy, though rather differently in each.

advantages? Plainly, it must be the fact that the troops are closer together
and operating on interior lines. There is no need to demonstrate how this
can multiply strength to the point where the attacker dare not expose
himself to it unless he is greatly superior.

starting later than the attacker, but still in time to burst the numbing bonds
of inactivity) the benefit of greater concentration and interior lines becomes
a decisive one which is more likely as a rule to lead to victory than a
convergent pattern of attack. But victory is the prerequisite for success: one
must vanquish the enemy before one can think of cutting off his retreat. In
short it becomes evident that the relationship is similar to that of attack and
defense in general. The convergent form pays dazzling dividends, but the
yield of the divergent form is more dependable. The former is the weaker
form with the active purpose; the latter the stronger form with the passive
purpose. That being so, it seems to me that they almost balance one another.
One might add that defense, not being absolute in every case, will not
always find it impossible to use its strength convergently. There is then no
longer a valid basis for the belief that the convergent form alone provides
attack with a universal advantage over defense. One’s judgment is thus
freed from the influence which that fallacy is apt to exert on it every time
the point comes up.

The foregoing remarks apply to tactics and to strategy alike. A

particularly important point, concerning strategy only, remains to be made.
The advantage of interior lines increases with the distances to which they
relate. Where distances measure a few thousand paces or a few miles, less
time will obviously be saved than over a march of several days or a distance
of a couple of hundred miles. The former, shorter, distances are a matter of
tactics; the longer ones, of strategy. While it is true that in strategy one
needs more time to reach an objective than in tactics, and it takes longer to
defeat an army than a battalion, even in strategy this time will increase only

up to a certain point—that is, until a battle has been fought, and possibly
also for the few days in which a battle can be avoided without serious
consequences. What is more an even greater difference lies in the absolute
lead gained in each case. The distances in tactics or in a battle are so slight
that an army makes its moves almost in full view of the enemy: therefore
anyone stationed on the outermost lines will soon be aware of the enemy’s
movements. With the greater distances involved in strategy, the movements
of the one will nearly always remain concealed from the other for at least a
day; and there are many instances of moves involving only part of an army,
or the despatch of a considerable force, that were kept from the enemy for
weeks. The considerable advantage of concealment to the side that, because
of its natural position, can best profit by it, must be obvious.

forces and of their relation to attack and defense; we shall return to both
aspects at a later stage.

Even when the only point of the war is to maintain the status quo, the

fact remains that merely parrying a blow goes against the essential nature of
war, which certainly does not consist merely in enduring. Once the defender
has gained an important advantage, defense as such has done its work.
While he is enjoying this advantage, he must strike back, or he will court
destruction. Prudence bids him strike while the iron is hot and use the
advantage to prevent a second onslaught. How, when, and where that
reaction is to begin depends, of course, on many other conditions which we
shall detail subsequently. For the moment we shall simply say that this
transition to the counterattack must be accepted as a tendency inherent in
defense—indeed, as one of its essential features. Wherever a victory
achieved by the defensive form is not turned to military account, where, so
to speak, it is allowed to wither away unused, a serious mistake is being
made.

A sudden powerful transition to the offensive—the flashing sword of

vengeance—is the greatest moment for the defense. If it is not in the
commander’s mind from the start, or rather if it is not an integral part of his
idea of defense, he will never be persuaded of the superiority of the
defensive form; all he will see is how much of the enemy’s resources he can
destroy or capture. But these things do not depend on the way in which the
knot is tied, but on the way in which it is untied. Moreover, it is a crude
error to equate attack with the idea of assault alone, and therefore, to
conceive of defense as merely misery and confusion.

defender does, and if he contrives to keep his preparations sufficiently
secret, he may well take his victim unawares. Yet such surprise has nothing
to do with war itself, and should not be possible. War serves the purpose of
the defense more than that of the aggressor. It is only aggression that calls
forth defense, and war along with it. The aggressor is always peace-loving
(as Bonaparte always claimed to be); he would prefer to take over our
country unopposed. To prevent his doing so one must be willing to make
war and be prepared for it. In other words it is the weak, those likely to
need defense, who should always be armed in order not to be overwhelmed.
Thus decrees the art of war.

that have nothing to do with the intention of attack or defense. They are not
the motives, but frequently the result of an early appearance. The side that
is ready first and sees a significant advantage in a surprise attack, will for
that reason take the offensive. The side that is slower to prepare can to some
degree make up for the consequent disadvantage by exploiting the
advantages of defense.

be ready must be considered an advantage to the attacker, as we have
acknowledged in Book Three. Still, this general advantage is not essential
in every specific case.

Consequently, if we are to conceive of defense as it should be, it is this.

All means are prepared to the utmost; the army is fit for war and familiar
with it; the general will let the enemy come on, not from confused
indecision and fear, but by his own choice, coolly and deliberately;
fortresses are undaunted by the prospect of a siege; and finally a stout-
hearted populace is no more afraid of the enemy than he of it. Thus
constituted, defense will no longer cut so sorry a figure when compared to
attack, and the latter will no longer look so easy and infallible as it does in
the gloomy imagination of those who see courage, determination, and
movement in attack alone, and in defense only impotence and paralysis.

1. Militia. In recent times the militia has been employed not only at home

but also to invade enemy territory, and there is no denying that its
organization in some countries—Prussia, for instance—is such that it can
almost be considered part of the regular army. In such cases it is not purely
an instrument of defense. Still, one should not forget that its vigorous use in
the years 1813, 1814, and 1815 originated in defensive warfare; that in only
the minority of countries is it organized as in Prussia; and that wherever its
organization is imperfect it will be better suited to defense than to attack.
Quite apart from this, the concept of a militia embodies the idea of an
extraordinary and largely voluntary participation in the war by the whole
population, with its physical strength, its wealth, and its loyalty. The less
the institution resembles this model, the more a militia will become a
regular army under another name. It will then have the advantages of a
regular army, but it will also be lacking in the advantages of a genuine
militia: a reservoir of strength that is much more extensive, much more
flexible, and whose spirit and loyalty are much easier to arouse. These
factors are the essentials of a militia. Its organization must leave scope for
the participation of the populace. If it does not, any great hopes one may
have from it are mere delusions.

concept of defense is unmistakable, and thus also the fact that such a militia
is likelier to be a part of defense than of attack. The qualities in which it is
superior to the aggressor will mainly show in the course of defensive action.

those that are closest to the border and is not very important. The influence
of the defender’s fortresses extends more deeply into his country; therefore
more of them are involved, and the contribution made by each is
incomparably greater. A fortress that attracts, and holds out against, a full-
scale siege will naturally weigh much more in the scales of war than one
that is so strongly fortified that it is clearly impregnable, and therefore
neither really engages nor destroys the enemy’s forces.

has as a rule no more noticeable influence on the war than a drop of water
on a river, the collective influence of the country’s inhabitants is far from
negligible, even when we are not dealing with popular insurrection. At
home, everything works more smoothly—assuming the public is not wholly
disaffected. Nothing, major or minor, is done for the enemy save under
force majeure, which the troops must apply at the expense of their own
strength and exertions. The defender can get all he wants. It may not be
freely given, as the fruit of enthusiastic loyalty; usually it is due to a long
tradition of civil obedience which is the citizen’s second nature, and also to
orders from the government, and other constraints not originating with the
military. But voluntary collaboration bom of genuine attachment is also
always of great value; particularly it will never be wanting when no actual
sacrifices are involved. Let us mention just one example, which is of great
importance for the conduct of operation: information. We refer not so much
to the single outstandingly significant report, but to the countless minor
contacts brought about by the daily activities of our army. Here the
defender’s close relations with the population give him a general
superiority. The smallest patrol, every picket, every sentry, every officer on
a mission, all have to turn to the local inhabitants for news of friend or foe.

If we proceed from these general conditions which always apply, to the

special cases in which the population begins to participate in the fighting
itself, until we reach the highest level at which, as in Spain, the war is
primarily waged by the people, it will be understood that we are dealing not

simply with an intensification of popular support but with a genuine new
source of power; which entitles one to say that:

of defense.

support. By this we do not mean the ordinary type of ally such as the
aggressor also possesses, but the kind who have a substantial interest in
maintaining the integrity of their ally’s country. If we consider the
community of states in Europe today, we do not find a systematically
regulated balance of power and of spheres of influence, which does not
exist and whose existence has often been justifiably denied; but we
certainly do find major and minor interests of states and peoples interwoven
in the most varied and changeable manner. Each point of intersection binds
and serves to balance one set of interests against the other. The broad effect
of all these fixed points is obviously to give a certain amount of cohesion to
the whole. Any change will necessarily weaken this cohesion to some
degree. The sum total of relations between states thus serves to maintain the
stability of the whole rather than to promote change; at least, that tendency
will generally be present.

interpreted; and this kind of balance is bound to emerge spontaneously
whenever a number of civilized countries are in multilateral relations.

To what extent this tendency of the common interest helps maintain

existing conditions is another question. One can certainly imagine changes
in relations between individual states that would strengthen this effect, and
others that could weaken it. The first kind are attempts to perfect the
political balance, and as their aim reflects that of the common interest, the
majority of the parties would be in favor. The other kind, however, are
deviations, hyperactivity of individual states, actual cases of disease; one
should not be surprised that diseases occur in a loosely constituted polity
such as a multitude of states of various sizes: after all, they also occur in the
marvelously structured organic whole of all living nature.

It may be objected, of course, that history offers examples of single states

effecting radical changes that benefit themselves alone, without the slightest
effort by the rest to hinder them. There have even been cases in which a
single state has managed to become so powerful that it could virtually

dictate to the rest. We would reply that this does not disprove the tendency
on the part of common interests to support the existing order; all it shows is
that at the moment the tendency was not sufficiently effective. Aspiration
toward a goal is not the same as motion, but that is not to say that it is a
nullity—witness the dynamics of the heavens.

intact—always assuming that the original condition was one of calm, of
equilibrium. Once there has been a disturbance and tension has developed it
is certainly possible that the tendency toward equilibrium will shift
direction and try to bring about a particular change. It lies in the nature of
things, however, that such a change can affect only a few states, never the
majority. Most states will certainly assume that the collective interest will
always represent and assure their stability. It is thus also certain that in
defending itself every individual state whose relations with the rest are not
already strained will find that it has more friends than enemies.

One may laugh at these reflections and consider them utopian dreams,

but one would do so at the expense of philosophic truth. Philosophy teaches
us to recognize the relations that essential elements bear to one another, and
it would indeed be rash from this to deduce universal laws governing every
single case, regardless of all haphazard influences. Those people, however,
who “never rise above anecdote” as a great writer said, and who would
construct all history of individual cases—starting always with the most
striking feature, the high point of the event, and digging only as deep as
suits them, never get down to the general factors that govern the matter.
Consequently their findings will never be valid for more than a single case;
indeed they will consider a philosophy that encompasses the general run of
cases as a mere dream.

quo, it would never have been possible for a number of civilized states to
coexist peacefully over a period of time; they would have been bound to
merge into a single state. The fact that Europe, as we know it, has existed
for over a thousand years can only be explained by the operation of these
general interests; and if collective security has not always sufficed to
maintain the integrity of each individual state, the fact should be ascribed to
irregularities in the life of the system as a whole which instead of
destroying were absorbed into it.

might have upset the balance too severely were prevented or reversed by
the more or less overt reaction of the other states. The briefest glance at
history will reveal them. One case, however, calls for mention—one which
is always trotted out by those who ridicule the very idea of political balance
—because it seems to be an extremely relevant example of how a harmless,
unaggressive country perished without any other coming to its assistance.
We refer to Poland. The fact that a state of eight million inhabitants could
vanish, partitioned by three others, with none of the remaining states
resorting to arms, will seem at first glance to be a case that either proves the
political balance to be generally ineffective or at least shows how
ineffective it can be in given circumstances. The fact that so large a state
could vanish and fall prey to others among which were already numbered
some of the most powerful (Russia and Austria) seemed an extreme case. If
such an event was unable to arouse the common interest of the community
of nations, one could argue that the effectiveness of the common interest in
assuring the survival of single states is an illusion. We insist, however, that
a single case, however striking, cannot vitiate a general principle; and
further contend that the demise of Poland is not as strange as it appears.
Could Poland really be considered a European state, an equal among equals
in the European community of nations? She could not: she was a Tartar
state. But instead of lying on the Black Sea, like the Tartars of the Crimea,
on the fringe of the European community, she was located in the midst of it
on the Vistula. In saying this we do not wish to slight the Poles or justify the
partition of their country. Our only concern is to face the facts. Poland had
not really played a political part for a century or so; she had merely been a
cause of dissension among other states. Given her condition and the kind of
constitution she had, she could not possibly maintain her independence. A
radical change from these Tartar-like conditions could have been
accomplished in the space of fifty or a hundred years, provided her leaders
had been willing. They, however, were too much Tartars themselves to
desire such a change. Their chaotic public life and their boundless
irresponsibility went together, and thus they were swallowed up by the
abyss. Long before the country was partitioned, the Russians were doing
what they liked there. The idea of Poland as an independent state with
meaningful frontiers no longer corresponded to the facts and nothing was

surer than that Poland would have become a Russian province if she had not
been partitioned. Had things been otherwise, had Poland been a country
able to defend itself, the three powers would not have so lightly undertaken
to partition it, and the powers most interested in maintaining its
independence (France, Sweden and Turkey) would have been able to
collaborate in its survival. But it is asking too much when a state’s integrity
must be maintained entirely by others.

Since then, the country had lost the character of a private home and had
become more like a public highway on which foreign armies could disport
themselves whenever and however they pleased. Were the other states
supposed to put a stop to that? Were they supposed to be continually in
arms in order to guard the political sanctity of the Polish frontier? That
would have been to ask for the morally impossible. Poland in those days
was, politically speaking, little better than an uninhabited steppe. This open
prairie land, located in the midst of other states, could neither be shielded
from their encroachments, nor could its political integrity be guaranteed by
others. For all these reasons one should find the silent demise of Poland no
more strange than that of the Crimean Tartar state. The Turks were certainly
more concerned about the Crimea than any of the European states were in
saving Poland; but they realized that it would simply be a waste of effort to
try and protect an unresisting steppe.

defender can count on outside assistance more than can the attacker; and the
more his survival matters to the rest—that is, the sounder and more
vigorous his political and military condition—the more certain he can be of
their help.

Naturally, the factors listed here as being the real means of defense will

not all be available in every case. Some may be missing in one case, some
in another; but they all come under the general heading of defense.

Consider in the abstract how war originates. Essentially, the concept of

war does not originate with the attack, because the ultimate object of attack
is not fighting: rather, it is possession. The idea of war originates with the
defense, which does have fighting as its immediate object, since fighting
and parrying obviously amount to the same thing. Repulse is directed only
toward an attack, which is therefore a prerequisite to it; the attack, however,
is not directed toward defense but toward a different goal—possession,
which is not necessarily a prerequisite for war. It is thus in the nature of the
case that the side that first introduces the element of war, whose point of
view brings two parties into existence, is also the side that establishes the
initial laws of war. That side is the defense. What is under discussion here is
not a specific instance but a general, abstract case, which must be
postulated to advance theory.

We now know where to find the fixed point that is located outside the

interaction of attack and defense: it lies with the defense.

If this argument is correct, the defender must establish ground rules for

his conduct even if he has no idea what the attacker means to do, and these
ground rules must certainly include the disposition of his forces. The
attacker, on the other hand, so long as he knows nothing about his
adversary, will have no guidelines on which to base the use of his forces.
All he can do is to take his forces with him—in other words, take

possession by means of his army. Indeed, that is what actually happens: for
it is one thing to assemble an army and another to use it. An aggressor may
take his army with him on the chance that he may have to use it, and though
he may take possession of a country by means of his army instead of
officials, functionaries, and proclamations, he has not yet, strictly speaking,
committed a positive act of war. It is the defender, who not only
concentrates his forces but disposes them in readiness for action, who first
commits an act that really fits the concept of war.

underlying causes that initially motivate the defense, before it has even
considered the possibility of being attacked? Obviously, it is an enemy’s
advance with a view to taking possession, which we have treated as
extraneous to war but which forms the basis for the initial steps of military
activity. This advance is meant to deter defense, and it must, therefore, be
thought of in relation to the country; and this is what produces the initial
general dispositions of the defense. Once these have been established, the
attack will be directed toward them, and new ground rules of defense will
be based on an examination of the means used by the attack. At this point
the interaction has become evident, and theorists may continue to study it as
long as new results appear and make the study seem worthwhile.

substance to our subsequent discussion; it is not intended for the battlefield,
nor for any future general, but for the legions of theorists who, up to now,
have treated such questions far too lightly.

will not be absolute either, but only relative. In terms of space, it relates to
the country, the theater of operations, or the position; in terms of time, to
the war, the campaign, or the battle. True these are not unalterable units, but
the central points of certain areas that overlap and merge with one another.
In practice, however, one must often be satisfied with merely arranging
things into categories rather than strictly separating them; and those terms,
in general usage, have become clearly enough defined to serve as nuclei
around which other ideas may conveniently be gathered.

The defender of a country, therefore, merely awaits the attack on his

country, the defender of a theater of war awaits the attack on that theater,
and the defender of a position awaits the attack on that position. Once the
enemy has attacked, any active and therefore more or less offensive move
made by the defender does not invalidate the concept of defense, for its
salient feature and chief advantage, waiting, has been established.

The concepts characteristic of time-war, campaign and battle—are

parallel to those of space-country, theater of operations and position—and
so bear the same relation to our subject.

Defense is thus composed of two distinct parts, waiting and acting. By

linking the former to a definite object that precedes action, we have been
able to merge the two into one whole. But a defensive action—especially a
large-scale one such as a campaign or a war—will not, in terms of time,
consist of two great phases, the first of which is pure waiting and the second
pure action; it will alternate between these two conditions, so that waiting
may run like a continuous thread through the whole period of defense.

attached to waiting. To be sure, earlier theorists never gave it the status of
an independent concept, but in practice it has continuously served as a
guideline, though for the most part men were not consciously aware of it.
Waiting is such a fundamental feature of all warfare that war is hardly
conceivable without it, and hence we shall often have occasion to revert to
it by pointing out its effect in the dynamic play of forces.

We should now like to elucidate how the principle of waiting runs

through the entire period of defense, and how the successive stages of
defense originate in it.

defer (till we reach the book on war plans) the defense of a country, a more
diversified subject, and one that is more strongly influenced by political
circumstances. On the other hand, defense in a position or in a battle is a
tactical matter; only when it is completed can it serve as the starting point of
strategic activity. Therefore, we shall take the defense of a theater of
operations as the subject that will best illustrate the conditions of defense.

riposte and therefore a reaction—are both essential parts of defense.
Without the former, it would not be defense, without the latter, it would not
be war. This conception has already led us to argue that defense is simply
the stronger form of war, the one that makes the enemy’s defeat more
certain. We must insist on this interpretation—partly because any other will
eventually lead to absurdity, partly because the more vivid and total this
impression, the more it will strengthen the total act of defense.

It would be contrary to this interpretation to discuss reaction, the second

necessary component of defense, by making a distinction between its parts,
and considering that phase which, strictly speaking, consists in warding off
the enemy—from the country, the theater of operations, the position—as the
only necessary part, which would be limited to what is needed to achieve
those purposes. The other phase, the possibility of a reaction that expands
into the realm of actual strategic offense, would then have to be considered
as being foreign to, and unconnected with, defense. Such a distinction is
basically unacceptable: we must insist that the idea of retaliation is
fundamental to all defense. Otherwise, no matter how much damage the
first phase of reaction, if successful, may have done to the enemy, the

proper balance would still be wanting in the restoration of the dynamic
relationship between attack and defense.

makes the enemy’s defeat more certain. It may be left to circumstances
whether or not a victory so gained exceeds the original purpose of the
defense.

enemy will be valid only on the condition that there is an attack. If no attack
is forthcoming, it is understood that the defense will be content to hold its
own; so this is its aim, or rather its primary aim, during the period of
waiting. The defense will be able to reap the benefits of the stronger form of
war only if it is willing to be satisfied with this more modest goal.

operations. It may do this in the following ways:

1. It can attack the enemy the moment he invades its theater of operations

(Mollwitz, Hohenfriedberg).

2. It can take up position near the frontier, wait until the enemy appears

and is about to attack, and then attack him first (Czaslau, Soor,
Rossbach). Such an attitude is obviously more passive; it calls for a
longer period of waiting; and though little or no time may be gained by
the second plan as compared to the first if the enemy really does
attack, still, the battle that was certain in the first case will be less
certain in the second, and it may turn out that the enemy’s
determination will not extend as far as an attack. The advantage of
waiting, therefore, has become greater.

3. It can wait, not merely for the enemy’s decision to attack—that is, his

appearance in full view of the position—but also for the actual attack
(as at Bunzelwitz, to take another example from the campaigns of the
commander we have been referring to) .104 In that event the army will
fight a true defensive battle, but one, as we have said before, that may
include offensive moves by some part of the army. Here too, as in the
previous case, the gain in time is immaterial, but the enemy’s
determination will be tested once again. Many an army has advanced
to the attack but refrained at the last moment, or desisted after the first
attempt on finding the enemy’s position too strong.

purpose of this withdrawal is to weaken the attacker to such an extent
that one can wait for him to break off his advance of his own accord,
or, at least, be too weak to overcome the resistance with which he will
eventually be confronted.

 
The simplest and most outstanding example would be the case in which

the defender is able to leave one or more fortresses behind, which the
attacker must invest or besiege. It is obvious that this will weaken his forces
and provide an opportunity for an attack by the defender at a point where he
has the upper hand.

Even where there are no fortresses, such a retreat to the interior can

gradually restore to the defender the balance or superiority that he did not
have on the frontier. In a strategic attack, every advance reduces the
attacker’s strength, partly as an absolute loss and partly because of the
division of forces which becomes necessary. We shall discuss this in greater
detail in connection with the attack. For the present, we shall simply assume
this statement to be correct, since it has been sufficiently demonstrated in
past wars.

The main advantage of this fourth case lies in the time that is gained. If

the enemy lays siege to our fortresses, we have gained time until their
surrender (which is probable, but which may take several weeks, and in
some cases months). If, on the other hand, his loss of strength, the
exhaustion of the momentum of his attack, is caused simply by his advance
and by having to leave garrisons at vital points, and thus only by the
distance he has covered, the amount of time gained will usually be even
greater and we are not so strongly compelled to act at any given moment.

Not only will the relative strength of defender and attacker have changed

when this action has run its course, the former will also have to his credit
the increased benefit of waiting. Even if the attacker has not been weakened
enough by his advance to prevent him from attacking our main force where
it has come to rest, he may lack the determination to do so. This
determination must be stronger here than it would have had to be at the
frontier: the reason is partly that his forces are reduced and no longer fresh
while his danger has increased, and partly that irresolute commanders will
completely forget about the necessity of a battle once possession of the area

has been achieved; either because they really think it is no longer necessary,
or because they are glad of the pretext. Their failure to attack is not, of
course, the adequate negative success for the defender that it would have
been on the frontier, but the time gained is substantial nonetheless.

benefit of terrain, and that the support of his fortresses and the populace are
favorable to his action. With each successive stage of defense these
elements become more significant, and in the fourth stage they are
particularly effective in weakening the enemy. Since the advantages of
waiting also increase with each phase, it follows that each successive stage
of defense is more effective than the last, and that this form of warfare gains
in effectiveness the further it is removed from attack. We are not afraid of
being accused on this account of believing that the most passive kind of
defense is the strongest. Each successive stage, far from being intended to
weaken the act of resistance, is meant merely to prolong and postpone it.
Surely there is no contradiction in saying that one is able to resist more
effectively in a strong and suitably entrenched position, and that, after the
enemy has wasted half his strength on it, a counterattack will be that much
more effective. Daun could hardly have won at Kolin without his strong
position. If his pursuit of the mere 18,000 men whom Frederick was able to
lead from the field had been more energetic, this victory could have been
one of the most brilliant in the annals of war.

defender’s predominance or, more accurately, his counterweight will
increase, and so in consequence will the strength of his reaction.

are to be had without cost? Not at all: the sacrifices with which they must
be purchased will increase equally.

Whenever we wait for the enemy inside our own theater of operations, no

matter how close to the frontier the decisive action may be fought, the
enemy’s forces will enter our theater of operations, which will entail
sacrifices in this area. If we had attacked him first, the damage would have
been incurred by him. The sacrifices tend to increase whenever we fail to
advance toward the enemy in order to attack him; the area he occupies and
the time he takes to advance to our position will continue to increase them.
If we intend to give defensive battle and thus leave the initiative and the

timing up to the enemy, the possibility exists that he may well remain for a
considerable time in the area he holds. So the time we gain by his
postponement of the decision has to be paid for in this manner. The
sacrifices become even more noticeable in the case of a retreat into the
interior of the country.

However, the reduction of the defender’s strength that is caused by all of

these sacrifices will usually affect his fighting forces only later, not
immediately: it is frequently so indirect as to be barely noticeable. Thus the
defender tries to increase his immediate strength by paying for it later—in
other words, he borrows like anyone else who needs more than he has.

In order to assess the results of these various forms of resistance, we have

to examine the purpose of the enemy’s attack. It is to gain possession of our
theater of operations, or at least a substantial part of it; for the concept of
the whole implies at least the greater part, and a strip a few miles wide is
seldom of independent strategic importance. Therefore, so long as the
attacker is not in possession, so long, in other words, as fear of our strength
has prevented him from entering our theater of operations or seeking out
our position or has caused him to avoid the battle we are prepared to give,
the objects of the defense have been accomplished. Our defensive
dispositions have proved successful. Admittedly, this is only a negative
success which will not directly produce enough strength for a real
counterattack. But it may do so in an indirect wav, gradually: the time that
passes is lost to the aggressor. Time lost is always a disadvantage that is
bound in some way to weaken him who loses it.

place at the border) the very lack of a decision constitutes a success for the
defense.

That, however, is not the case in the fourth stage.
If the enemy lays siege to our fortresses we must relieve them in good

time—in other words, it is up to us to bring about a decision by positive
action.

without besieging any of our fortresses. While we may have more time and
can wait until the enemy is at his weakest, the assumption will remain that
we shall have to take the initiative in the end. Indeed, the enemy may by
then have taken all of the area that was the object of his attack, but he holds

it as a loan. The tension continues to exist, and the decision is still to come.
So long as the defender’s strength increases every day while the attacker’s
diminishes, the absence of a decision is in the former’s best interest; but if
only because the effects of the general losses to which the defender has
continually exposed himself are finally catching up with him, the point of
culmination will necessarily be reached when the defender must make up
his mind and act, when the advantages of waiting have been completely
exhausted.

come; a great many conditions and circumstances may determine it. We
should note, however, that the approach of winter is usually the most
natural turning point. If we cannot prevent the enemy from wintering in the
area he has occupied, we might as well give it up for lost. Even so there is
the example of Torres Vedras to remind us that this is not a universal rule.

What is it that, broadly speaking, constitutes a decision?
In our discussion, we have always assumed decision to occur in the form

of battle, but that is not necessarily so. We can think of any number of
engagements by smaller forces that may lead to a change in fortune, either
because they really end in bloodshed, or because the probability of their
consequences necessitate the enemy’s retreat.

that necessarily follows from the concept of war we have proposed. Even
where the hostile army is forced to retreat because of lack of food, this
factor does after all arise out of the limitations that our forces impose. If our
army were not present, the enemy would surely find ways of helping
himself.

So even when his offensive has run its course, when the enemy has

become the victim of the difficult conditions of the advance and has been
weakened and reduced by hunger, by sickness and the need to detach
troops, it is really the fear of our fighting forces alone that makes him turn
about and abandon all he has gained. Nevertheless there is a vast difference
between such a decision and one that has been reached at the border.

At the border, his arms are faced by our arms—they alone hold him in

check or do him damage. But when his offensive has run its course, he has
been worn out largely by his own efforts. This will impart a completely
different value to our arms, which are no longer the only factor in the

decision though they may be the ultimate one. The ground has been
prepared for it by the breakdown of the enemy’s forces during their advance
to the extent where a retreat, and a complete reversal of the situation, can be
caused by the mere possibility of our reaction. In such a case one is bound
to be realistic, to give credit for the decision to the difficulties of the
offensive. Admittedly, one will not be able to find an example in which the
defending forces were not also a factor, but for the sake of practical
considerations, it is important to distinguish which of these two factors was
dominant.

In the light of these ideas we think it is fair to say that two decisions, and

therefore two kinds of reaction, are possible on the defending side,
depending on whether the attacker is to perish by the sword or by his own
exertions.

It is obvious that the first type of decision will predominate in the first

three stages of defense, and the second type in the fourth. Indeed, the latter
can essentially only take place where the retreat penetrates deeply into the
interior of the country. It is in fact the only reason that can justify such a
retreat and the great sacrifices it entails.

There are cases in military history where they stand out as clearly and
distinctly as any abstract concept ever can in practice. In 1745 Frederick the
Great attacked the Austrians at Hohenfriedberg as they descended from the
Silesian mountains—at a time when their strength could not have been
sapped either by exertions or by the detachment of troops. Wellington, on
the other hand, stayed in the fortified lines of Torres Vedras until cold and
hunger had left Masséna’s army so depleted that it withdrew of its own
accord. In that case the defender’s forces took no part in the actual process
of wearing down the enemy. At other times where both types are closely
linked, one will still be distinctly dominant. Take, for instance, 1812. In that
famous campaign so many savage engagements were fought that, under
different circumstances, an absolute decision might well have been reached
by the sword alone; yet there is probably no other case in which the
evidence is so clear that the invader was destroyed by his own exertions.
Only about 90,000 of the 300,000 men who made up the French center
reached Moscow. Only 13,000 men had been detached. Casualties,

of the famous Fabius Cunctator, were calculated primarily to destroy the
enemy by making him exhaust himself.

In general there have been many campaigns that were won on that

principle without anyone explicitly saying so. One will arrive at the true
cause of many decisions only by ignoring the far-fetched explanations of
historians, and instead closely examining the events themselves.

We believe that we have thus adequately described the considerations

that underlie defense and its various phases. By pointing out these two chief
means of resistance, we hope we have explained clearly how the principle
of waiting runs through the whole system and combines with the principle
of positive action in such a way that the latter may appear early in one case
and late in another. After which, the advantages of waiting will be seen to
be exhausted.

We believe that we have now surveyed as well as delimited the whole

field of defense. True, there still are aspects that are important enough to
deserve a chapter on their own, points on which a series of reflections could
be based and which ought not to be overlooked: for instance, the nature and
influence of fortresses and entrenched camps, the defense of mountains and
rivers, flanking operations, and so forth. We shall deal with these in the
chapters that follow. Still, none of these subjects seems to fall outside the
scope of the ideas explained above, but merely constitute their application
to specific places and circumstances. The foregoing sequence of ideas has
developed out of the concept of defense and its relation to attack. We have
linked those simple ideas with reality, and so demonstrated how to move
from reality to these simple ideas and achieve a solid analytic base. In the
course of debate we will therefore not need to resort to arguments that
themselves are ephemeral.

change the appearance and vary the character of armed defense, especially
in cases where there is no actual fighting but the outcome is affected by the
fact that there could be, that one is almost tempted to think some new
effective principle here awaits discovery. The vast difference between
savage repulse in a straightforward battle, and the effect of a strategic web

that prevents things from getting that far, will lead one to assume that a
different force must be at work—a conjecture somewhat like that of the
astronomers’ who deduced from the enormous void between Mars and
Jupiter that other planets must exist.

cannot take, or on the far side of a river that he believes to be impassable, or
even if he fears he will jeopardize his food supply by advancing any further,
it is still only the force of the defender’s arms which produces these results.
What actually halts the aggressor’s action is the fear of defeat by the
defender’s forces, either in major engagements or at particularly important
points; but he is not likely to concede this, at least not openly.

One may admit that even where the decision has been bloodless, it was

determined in the last analysis by engagements that did not take place but
had merely been offered. In that case, it will be argued, the strategic
planning of these engagements, rather than the tactical decision, should be
considered the operative principle. Moreover such strategic planning would
be dominant only in cases where defense is conducted by some means other
than force of arms. We admit this; but it brings us to the very point we
wanted to make. What we say in fact is this: where the tactical results of the
engagement are assumed to be the basis of all strategic plans, it is always
possible, and a serious risk, that the attacker will proceed on that basis. He
will endeavor above all to be tactically superior, in order to upset the
enemy’s strategic planning. The latter, therefore, can never be considered as
something independent: it can only become valid when one has reason to be
confident of tactical success. To illustrate briefly what we mean, let us
recall that a general such as Bonaparte could ruthlessly cut through all his
enemies’ strategic plans in search of battle, because he seldom doubted the
battle’s outcome. So whenever the strategists did not endeavor with all their
might to crush him in battle with superior force, whenever they engaged in
subtler (and weaker) machinations, their schemes were swept away like
cobwebs. Schemes of that sort would have been enough to check a general
like Daun; but it would have been folly to oppose Bonaparte and his army
in the way the Prussians handled Daun and the Austrians in the Seven Years
War. Why? Because Bonaparte was well aware that everything turned on
tactical results, and because he could rely on them, while Daun’s situation
was different in both respects. That is why we think it is useful to emphasize

that all strategic planning rests on tactical success alone, and that—whether
the solution is arrived at in battle or not—this is in all cases the actual
fundamental basis for the decision. Only when one has no need to fear the
outcome—because of the enemy’s character or situation or because the two
armies are evenly matched physically and psychologically or indeed
because one’s own side is the stronger—only then can one expect results
from strategic combinations alone.

in which the attacker broke off his offensive without having fought a
decisive battle, consequently where strategic combinations appear effective,
we might believe that such combinations have at least great inherent power,
and that they would normally decide the outcome on their own whenever
one did not need to assume a decisive superiority of the offensive in tactical
situations. Our answer here must be that this assumption, too, is erroneous
in situations that arise in the theater of operations and are therefore part of
war itself. The reason for the ineffectiveness of most attacks lies in the
general, the political conditions of war.

basis, will also determine its character. This will later be discussed in
greater detail, under the heading of war plans. But these general conditions
have transformed most wars into mongrel affairs, in which the original
hostilities have to twist and turn among conflicting interests to such a
degree that they emerge very much attenuated. This is bound to affect the
offensive, the side of positive action, with particular strength. It is not
surprising, therefore, that one can stop such a breathless, hectic attack by
the mere flick of a finger. Where resolution is so faint and paralyzed by a
multitude of considerations that it has almost ceased to exist, a mere show
of resistance will often suffice.

We can see that in many cases the reason for the defender’s being

successful without having to fight does not lie in the fact that he occupies
many impregnable positions, nor in the size of the mountain ranges that lie
across the theater of operations, nor in the broad stream that traverses it, nor
in the ease with which the threatened blow can be paralyzed by a well-
planned series of engagements. The real reason is the faintness of the
attacker’s determination, which makes him hesitate and fear to move.

they must be recognized for what they are, rather than having their effects
attributed to other causes—those that alone concern us here. We must state
emphatically that, in this respect, military history can well become a
chronic lie and deception if critics fail to apply the required correctives.

of offensive campaigns that failed without a decisive battle being fought.

little, but then begins to have doubts about risking a decisive battle. He halts
and faces his opponent, acting as if he had made a conquest and was
interested only in protecting it—in short, he behaves as if it were the
enemy’s affair to seek a battle, as if he himself were ready to fight at any
time, and so forth. All of these are mere pretexts, which a general uses to
delude his army, his government, the world at large, and even himself. The
truth of the matter is that the enemy’s position has been found too strong.
Here we are not talking of a case in which the aggressor fails to attack
because a victory would be of no use to him, because his advance having
run its course he does not have enough resiliency to start a new one. This
would assume that a successful attack had already taken place and resulted
in a genuine conquest; rather, we have in mind a case in which the
aggressor gets bogged down in the middle of an intended conquest.

exploit. There is as a rule no reason to expect such a favorable turn: the
very fact that an attack had been intended implies that the immediate future
promises no more than the present. It is therefore a fresh delusion. If, as is
usual, the operation is a joint one timed to coincide with others, the other
armies will then be blamed for his failures. By way of excusing his inaction
he will plead inadequate support and cooperation. He will talk of
insuperable obstacles, and look for motives in the most intricately
complicated circumstances. So he will fritter his strength away in doing
nothing, or rather in doing too little to bring about anything but failure.
Meanwhile the defender is gaining time—which is what he needs most. The
season is getting late, and the whole offensive ends with the return of the
invader to his winter quarters in his own theater of operations.

obvious and simple truth: that failure was due to fear of the enemy’s forces.

When the critics begin to study a campaign of this sort they tend to get lost
in argument and counterargument. No convincing answer will be found,
because everything is guesswork and the critics never dig deep enough to
find the truth.

That sort of fraudulence is not merely a matter of bad habit; its roots lie

in the nature of the case. The counterweights that weaken the elemental
force of war, and particularly the attack, are primarily located in the
political relations and intentions of the government, which are concealed
from the rest of the world, the people at home, the army, and in some cases
even from the commander. For instance no one can and will admit that his
decision to stop or to give up was motivated by the fear that his strength
would run out, or that he might make new enemies or that his own allies
might become too strong. That sort of thing is long kept confidential,
possibly forever. Meanwhile, a plausible account must be circulated. The
general is, therefore, urged, either for his own sake or the sake of his
government, to spread a web of lies. This constantly recurring shadow-
boxing in the dialectics of war has, as theory, hardened into systems, which
are, of course, equally misleading. Only a theory that will follow the simple
thread of internal cohesion as we have tried to make ours do, can get back
to the essence of things.

verbiage concerning attack and defense will collapse, and the simple
conceptualization we have offered will automatically emerge. We believe
that it is valid for the whole field of defense, and that only if we cling to it
firmly can the welter of events be clearly understood and mastered.

Let us now examine the employment of these various methods of

defense.

They are all intensifications of the same thing, each one exacting

increased sacrifices on the part of the defender. A general’s choice, all other
things being equal, would largely be determined by this fact. He would
choose the method he considered adequate to give his forces the necessary
degree of resistance; but to avoid unnecessary losses he would not retreat
any further. It must be admitted, however, that the choice of different
methods is already severely limited by other major factors that play a part in
defense and are bound to urge him to use one method or another. A
withdrawal to the interior calls for ample space, or else it requires

conditions like those that obtained in Portugal in 1810: one ally (England)
provided solid support to the rear, while another (Spain), with its extensive
territory, reduced a great deal of the enemy’s impact. The location of
fortresses—close to the border or farther inland—may also decide for or
against a certain method. Even more decisive are the nature of the terrain
and the country, and the character, customs, and temper of its people. The
choice between an offensive and defensive battle may be determined by the
enemy’s plans or by the characteristics of both armies and their generals.
Finally, the possession or lack of an outstanding position or defensive line
may lead to one method or the other. In short, a mere listing of these factors
is enough to indicate that in defense they are more influential on the choice
than is relative strength alone. Since we shall become more familiar with
the most important factors that have here only been touched upon, we will
later be able to demonstrate in greater detail what influence they exert on
the choice. Finally, the implications will be treated in a comprehensive
analysis in the book on war plans and campaign plans.

That influence, however, will normally become decisive only if the

relative strengths are not too disproportionate. Where they are (and
therefore in the majority of cases), relative strength will prevail. The history
of war is full of proof that this has actually occurred—quite apart from the
chain of reasoning developed here—through the hidden processes of
intuitive judgment, like almost everything that happens in war. It was the
same general, with the same army, who, in the same theater of operations,
fought the battle of Hohenfriedberg and also moved into camp at
Bunzelwitz. Thus, even Frederick the Great, who when it came to a battle
was the most offensive-minded of generals, was finally compelled to resort
to a strict defensive when the disproportion of strength became too great.
Indeed did not Bonaparte, who used to rush at his enemies like a wild boar,
twist and turn like a caged animal when the ratio of forces was no longer in
his favor in August and September 1813, without attempting a reckless
attack on any one of his enemies? And do we not find him at Leipzig, in
October of the same year, when the disparity of forces had reached its peak,
taking refuge in the angle made by the Parthe, Elster, and Pleisse rivers, as
if he were cornered in a room with his back to the wall, waiting for his
enemies?

shows that our aim is not to provide new principles and methods of
conducting war; rather, we are concerned with examining the essential
content of what has long existed, and to trace it back to its basic elements.

As the battlefield in strategy is simply a point in space, so the duration of

a battle is strategically only a moment in time, and a battle’s strategic
significance lies not in its course but in its outcome and its consequence.

If it were true that total victory could be linked to the offensive elements

that are present in every defensive battle, no basic strategic difference
between an offensive and a defensive battle would exist. That is in fact our
own belief, although appearances seem to contradict it. To examine the
matter more closely, to clarify our views and so eliminate that contradiction,
let us briefly outline our idea of a defensive battle.

The defender waits for the attack in position, having chosen a suitable

area and prepared it; which means he has carefully reconnoitered it, erected
solid defenses at some of the most important points, established and opened
communications, sited his batteries, fortified some villages, selected

covered assembly areas, and so forth. The strength of his front, access to
which is barred by one or more parallel trenches or other obstacles or by
dominant strong points, makes it possible for him, while the forces at the
points of actual contact are destroying each other, to inflict heavy losses on
the enemy at low cost to himself as the attack passes through the successive
stages of resistance until it reaches the heart of the position. The points of
support on which his flanks rest secure him against sudden attacks from
several directions. The covered ground on which the defender has taken up
his position will make the attacker wary, even timid. It will enable the
defender to slow down the general retrograde movement by means of small
successful counterattacks as the area of action steadily narrows. In this way
the defender can confidently survey the battle as it smolders before his eyes.
But he knows that he cannot hold his front forever, that his flanks are not
invulnerable, and that he cannot change the whole course of the battle by
the successful counterattack of a few battalions or squadrons. He holds his
position in depth, for at every level, from division to battalion, his order of
battle has reserves for unforeseen events and to renew the action. A
substantial reserve, however—perhaps one quarter or one third of his whole
force—is kept far to the rear, far enough to avoid any casualties from
enemy fire and, if possible, far enough to remain outside any possibility of
envelopment. This reserve is meant to cover his flanks against any wider
and larger turning movement, and to protect him against the unexpected. In
the final third of the battle, when the enemy has revealed his whole plan and
spent the major part of his forces, the defender intends to fling this body
against a part of the enemy forces, thus opening a minor offensive battle of
his own, using every element of attack—assault, surprise, and flanking
movements. All these pressures will be brought to bear on the battle’s
center of gravity while the outcome still hangs in the balance, in order to
produce a total reversal.

This is the normal course of a defensive battle as we conceive of it, based

on contemporary tactics. In such a battle the attacker’s turning movement,
intended to give his attack a better chance and his victory a greater scale, is
countered by a subordinate turning movement, which is aimed at that part
of the enemy’s force that has executed the original envelopment. This
subordinate turning movement may suffice to cancel out the effect of the
enemy’s, but it cannot be expanded into a similar general envelopment of

the enemy’s forces. So, the difference between the forms of victory will
always lie in the fact that in an offensive battle the attacker does the turning
and then converges on the center, while in a defensive battle the movement
is more likely to fan out from the center toward the periphery.

On the battlefield, and in the first stage of pursuit, it must be

acknowledged that a turning movement is the more effective form. This is
not due to the form of envelopment as such; rather it holds true only where
the envelopment can be pushed to an extreme, when it can severely restrict
the enemy’s chances of retreat while the battle is still in progress. This is the
very situation that the defender’s positive counterattack is designed to
prevent. In many cases where a counterattack is not enough to win a
victory, it may still suffice to provide protection in that extremity. At all
events, we must admit that, in a defensive battle, the danger of having one’s
retreat severely restricted is preeminently present; where it cannot be
averted, the impact of defeat and of the early stage of pursuit is aggravated.

is, until nightfall. By the following day the envelopment will have reached
its limit, and in this respect both sides will again be in balance.

The defender’s principal line of retreat may of course be lost. If so, he

will thereafter be at a strategic disadvantage. But encirclement itself will,
with few exceptions, be at an end, since it was intended only for the
battlefield, and cannot go much beyond it.

defeated army will split up. At first, this will make the retreat easier, but by
the following day the reunion of all the parts will become its primary
objective. Where the victory was decisive and the defender pursues it
energetically, concentration is frequently impossible. The fragmentation of
the beaten army can thus lead to the gravest consequences, which may by
stages end in complete disintegration. If Bonaparte had won the battle of
Leipzig, the allied armies would have been cut off from one another and the
effect on their strategic cohesion would have been serious. At Dresden,
where Bonaparte admittedly did not fight a true defensive battle, the attack
still maintained the geometric form under discussion—from the center
toward the periphery. The embarrassment suffered by the allies as a
consequence of operating in separate columns is well known. Their

embarrassment was ended only by the victory on the Katzbach, the news of
which caused Bonaparte to return to Dresden with the Guards.

offensive at the last possible moment, and his attack therefore had a
diverging effect. The French corps were forced apart. Several days after the
battle, Puthod’s division fell into allied hands as a fruit of victory.

which is natural for him, to enhance his victory, the defender has in the
divergent form, which is natural for him, a means of making his victory
more effective than it would be in the simple case of parallel positions and
vertical operations. We believe that one form is worth at least as much as
the other.

defensive battles than of offensive ones, but that does not prove that
defensive battles are inherently less likely to be victorious: rather, the
defender simply finds himself in markedly different circumstances. In most
cases, he is the weaker belligerent—not only in numbers but also in terms
of his entire situation. Usually he is not, or does not believe himself to be,
able to follow up a victory, and is, therefore, satisfied with having repulsed
the danger and saved the honor of his arms. There is no question that the
defender may be handicapped by his numerical weakness and his
circumstances; but frequently what should be seen as the result of necessity
has been interpreted as the result of defense as such. In this absurd manner
it has become a basic assumption that defensive battles are meant merely to
repulse the enemy, and not to destroy him. We consider this as a most
damaging error, in fact a confusion between form and substance. We
maintain unequivocally that the form of warfare that we call defense not
only offers greater probability of victory than attack, but that its victories
can attain the same proportions and results. Moreover, this applies not only
to the aggregate success of all the engagements that make up a campaign,
but to each individual battle, provided there is no lack of strength and
determination.

These simple and basic purposes of fortresses did not remain the only

ones. The relation in which fortresses stood to the country as a whole and to
the troops who fought across the land soon extended their importance. Their
significance was felt beyond their walls; it contributed to the conquest or
retention of the country, the successful or unsuccessful outcome of the
whole struggle, and thus tended to give the war itself greater coherence. In
this way, fortresses attained a strategic significance that for a time was
considered so important that they formed the basis of strategic plans, which
were more concerned with capturing a few fortresses than with destroying
the enemy’s armies. People examined the root cause of this significance, the
connection between a fortified point and its surroundings and the army, and
believed that no amount of care, ingenuity, and abstract thought could be
too great when it came to choosing the points to be fortified. These
abstractions tended to obscure the original purposes altogether, and
eventually someone conceived of the idea of fortresses without towns and
inhabitants.

But the time is past when mere enclosure and fortification, without any

other military preparations, protect a locality against a tide of war that
inundates the whole country. This used to be possible, partly because of the
petty states into which nations were split, partly because of the periodic
nature that then characterized invasions. Their duration used to be limited
like the seasons of the year, either because the feudal levies would hurry
home or because the cash with which condottieri were paid would regularly

run out. Since great standing armies mechanically flattened the resistance of
individual strong points with their powerful artillery no city or minor
township felt like gambling with its strength, only to be taken a few weeks
or months later, and then to receive harsher treatment. It is still less in the
interest of the army to be split up into a large number of small fortified
garrisons. While this may delay the enemy’s progress, it will undoubtedly
end with the fortresses being taken. Enough strength must always be left to
meet the enemy in battle on equal terms, unless one can count on the arrival
of an ally who will relieve the fortresses and set the army free. As a result,
fortresses have had to be heavily reduced in number. This in turn has made
us discard the notion of using fortresses for the immediate protection of the
population and property of the towns, and led us to the idea of treating
fortresses as an indirect protection of the country, by means of their
strategic value as knots that hold the web of strategy together.

practice—though the books have admittedly spun them out, as they always
do.

shall consider only these requirements when listing the purposes and
conditions of fortresses, proceeding from the simple to the complex. The
following chapter will indicate the deductions concerning location and
number of fortresses that can be drawn from their purposes.

elements, one active and the other passive. The first appears in the
protection that a fortress gives to the area and everything in it; by the
second, it exercises a certain influence on the countryside beyond the range
of its artillery.

approaches. The larger the garrison, the larger the units that can be sent out
for this purpose; and as a rule, the larger they are, the farther they can be
sent. It follows that the active sphere of influence of a large fortress, as
compared to a small one, is not only stronger but also more extensive. In
turn the active element itself consists, so to speak, of two additional
elements: operations carried out by the garrison itself, and operations
carried out by independent forces, large or small, which are keeping in

touch with it. In fact, forces that would be too weak to face the enemy alone
can keep the field and control the area to some extent if they are sure they
can take refuge inside its walls in the last resort.

limited. Even in the case of large fortresses and numerically strong
garrisons, the units that can make a sortie are not significant compared to
the forces in the field, and their average range of operations is rarely more
than that of a few marches. Minor fortresses can only send out very small
detachments, and those can affect only the nearest villages. Independent
corps, however—troops that are not part of the garrison and therefore do
not necessarily have to fall back upon the fortress—are much less
constrained. In the right conditions, they can greatly extend a fortress’
active sphere of influence. Therefore, when we talk about the active
effectiveness. of fortresses in general, this is the part to bear particularly in
mind.

still essential to every function that a fortress must fulfill. Strictly speaking,
even the most passive function of a fortress, defense against assault, cannot,
after all, be imagined without this active element. It is quite obvious,
however, that among the various ways in which a fortress may be
significant—whether it be intrinsic or dependent on the circumstances of
the moment— some will tend to involve the more passive effect, and others
the more active. Sometimes the significance of a fortress may be said to be
simple, in which case its effectiveness is direct; sometimes it is complex,
and its effectiveness will be more or less indirect. We shall proceed from
the former to the latter. Let us state at the outset, however, that any fortress
may of course be of significance in several or even all of the ways listed
simultaneously, or at any rate at different times.

We suggest that fortresses constitute the first and foremost support of

defense, in the following ways:
  

1. As secure depots. During an offensive, the attacker lives from hand to

mouth; the defender, as a rule, has to make his preparations well ahead, and
therefore he cannot live only off the country he holds—which in any case
he would rather spare. Consequently, he is in great need of depots. As the
attacker advances, he leaves his supplies behind and so protects them; the

supplies of the defense lie in the middle of the operational zone. Unless
these supplies are stored in fortified places, operations in the field will
suffer badly. The most extensive and inconvenient positions often have to
be set up solely for the purpose of protecting them.

is a body without armor.

related to the first, because large and prosperous towns, especially
commercial ones, are an army’s natural sources of supply, which is,
therefore, immediately affected by their possession or loss. Besides, it is
always worth an effort to retain this component of the national assets, partly
because of all that can be drawn from it indirectly, and partly because an
important town weighs heavily in the scales when it comes to negotiating
peace.

among the most obvious, highly effective, and least susceptible to misuse.
Imagine a country where not only the large and prosperous town, but every
sizable one is fortified and defended by its citizens and the farmers of the
surrounding areas. The speed of military operations would be so reduced,
and so much weight thrown into the scale by the defending inhabitants, that
the skill and determination of the enemy commander would dwindle almost
to insignificance. We only mention this ideal scale of fortification in order
to do justice to this particular role of a stronghold, and to make sure that the
value of the direct protection it provides will not for a moment be ignored.
This mental image, by the way, will not affect our inquiry, for among so
many towns, some will always be more strongly fortified than others, and
those are the ones that must be considered the real support of the armed
forces.

of fortresses.

3. As real barriers. These fortresses block the roads, and also, in most

cases, the rivers on which they are located.

It is not so easy as one might think to find a serviceable detour to bypass

the fortress. It must not only be out of artillery range but also more or less
beyond the reach of possible sorties.

often cause delays worth a whole day’s march. This can be of great
importance if the road is used repeatedly.

clear enough.

insignificant fortress will normally have a diameter of several miles, and in
any case its offensive effectiveness will extend still farther. Therefore
fortresses should be considered the most favorable points of support for the
flanks of a position. A lake that is several miles long may be of value as a
point of support, but one can accomplish more with a moderate-sized
fortress. The flank need never be close by: the attacker cannot enter the area
between the two, for he would have no line of retreat.

lines of communication, as they are in most cases, they are convenient
stopping places for the traffic moving up and down the line. The danger to
which the lines of communication are exposed stems mainly from periodic
raids by partisans. If an important convoy is threatened by this type of
action and can reach a fortress by increasing its speed or doubling back, it is
safe and can wait until the road is clear. A fortress also gives all troops in
transit a chance to rest for a day or two, and so to complete their march in
better time. Since rest days are the ones that pose the greatest danger to the
troops, a fortress that is situated at the midpoint of a line of communications
150 miles long will, in a sense, cut it by half.

guns of a fortress of reasonable size, troops are safe from enemy action,
even without an especially entrenched camp. Granted, a unit that wants to
stay there has to give up the idea of further retreat; but there are times when
this is no great loss—when a continued withdrawal would only end in
complete destruction.

retreat having to be abandoned. It serves as a refuge, particularly for the
lightly wounded, the dispersed, and so forth, who have hurried ahead of the
defeated army: a place for them to wait until they can rejoin their units.

and if that line had not already been lost at Auerstädt, the army could easily

have halted there for three or four days, using the time to rally and reform.
Even under the circumstances that prevailed, Magdeburg served as a
rallying point for what was left of Hohenlohe’s corps; it was only there that
this corps took visible shape again.

Only actual experience in war will enable one to conceive of the

stabilizing influence that a nearby fortress exerts under adverse conditions.
There one can find stocks of arms and powder, forage and bread, shelter for
the sick, safety for the able-bodied, and comfort for the panic-stricken. A
fortress is an oasis in the desert.

influence of fortresses to a somewhat greater degree.

defensive line may be likened to blocks of ice in the course of a river’s
flow. The enemy must invest them, and, if the garrisons do their best, this
will require twice their number. On top of that, however, half a garrison can
and should consist of troops which, but for the fortress, could never have
gone on active service: half-trained militia, convalescents, armed civilians,
home guard, etc. In such a case, the drain on the enemy may be four times
as much as the drain on our side.

greatest merit of a fortress that holds out against a siege, but there are
others. Once an attacker has pierced the line of the defender’s fortresses, he
has far less freedom of movement: his lines of possible retreat are limited,
and he must constantly attend to the need for direct coverage of any siege
he undertakes.

With this fortresses begin to play a great and decisive part in the conduct

of defense. It should be considered the foremost role a fortress can fill.

Nonetheless, this use of fortresses, far from being employed with

regularity, is comparatively rare. The reason lies in the nature of most wars.
For many, it is in a sense too drastic, too decisive a method to employ, as
we shall explain in detail later.

This role of a fortress involves mainly its offensive power; at least, that is

what produces its effectiveness. If a fortress were merely a point that the
attacker was unable to occupy, it would admittedly be an obstacle to him,
but never enough to make him feel that he has to lay siege to it. However,
he cannot leave six, eight or ten thousand men to do as they like behind his

back; he must therefore invest the place in adequate strength. In order not to
be forced to do this repeatedly, he must assault the fortress and take it. Once
the siege begins, it is mainly the passive role that comes into play.

simple in form. The two purposes that follow, on the other hand, are more
complex in their effect.

cover a billeting area 15 to 20 miles wide behind it is a simple factor of its
existence; but if this kind of place—as military history frequently tells us—
has been privileged to cover a line of billets extending over 75 to 100 miles,
an explanation is required, as well as a special comment on the cases where
it was merely an illusion.

The following points should be considered:

1. The fortress itself must block one of the main roads and must

effectively cover an expanse of 15 to 20 miles.

2. It must either be considered as an exceptionally strong advanced post

or it must offer a full view of the countryside, heightened by secret
intelligence obtained through the ordinary intercourse between an
important town and its surrounding area. It is to be expected that in a
place of six, eight or ten thousand inhabitants, more news will be
available than in a mere village where an ordinary outpost might be
based.

3. It is a source of support for minor units, which can find safety and

cover there. From time to time they can make a sortie against the
enemy, collect intelligence, or attack his rear if he happens to pass by.
In brief, then, while a fortress is not itself mobile, it can to some extent
have the effect of an advanced corps (Book Five, Chapter Eight).

4. After having assembled his troops, the defender must be able to take

up his position immediately to the rear of the fortress. The attacker will
then not be able to reach him without the fortress becoming a danger to
his own rear.

 
Of course, any attack on a line of billets should in itself be considered as

a surprise; or rather, that is the only aspect that concerns us here. A surprise
attack will obviously take effect more quickly than a major offensive

against a theater of operations. In the latter case, of course, if one has to
bypass a fortress, one has no choice but to invest and hold it in check; but in
a surprise attack on a line of billets this is not so necessary, and a fortress
will therefore not hamper it to the same degree. This is certainly true;
besides, a fortress cannot directly cover the flanks of a line of billets thirty
to forty miles away. On the other hand, a surprise attack of that kind is not
just aimed at a few billets. Later, in the book on attack, we will be able to
explain more fully what such an attack really aims at and what can be the
expected result. This much, however, can be said at once: its chief results
will not derive from the actual attack on individual billets, but from the
engagements it forces upon isolated, unprepared units that are less
concerned with fighting than with getting to their destinations in a hurry.
This type of attack and pursuit, however, must always be more or less
directed against the center of the enemy’s quarters; if an important fortress
were located in front of the center, it would pose a serious obstacle to the
attacker.

We maintain that the combined effect of these four points constitutes

evidence that a major fortress can at any rate provide a direct and indirect
degree of cover for a far greater billeting-area than one might suppose at
first glance. We say “a degree of cover,” for all these indirect effects
together do not make the enemy’s advance impossible; they only make it
more difficult and more hazardous—in other words, less likely, and less
dangerous to the defender. Indeed, that is all one asks of it, and all that the
term implies in this particular connection. Real, direct protection must come
from outposts and the way the billets are arranged.

cover for a widespread billeting-area in its rear; but there is no denying,
either, that one can find empty phrases and sophistical opinions on the
matter in actual war plans, and even more frequently in military histories.
After all, if that amount of cover is the result only of a combination of a
number of circumstances, and then does no more than reduce the danger,
one can see that in individual cases the cover may turn out to be quite
unreal—because of unusual circumstances, or, more likely, because of the
boldness of the attacker. In wartime then, one should never take it for
granted that a given fortress will produce a given effect; the matter calls for
careful study in each case.

or occupied only by a token force, and at the same time is more or less
exposed to enemy raids, a reasonably important fortress located in the area
can be considered as its cover or even as its security. It may certainly be
considered as protection, because the enemy cannot become master of the
province until he has taken the fortress, which gives the defender time to
come to its aid. The actual cover, though, can only be described as indirect,
or symbolic, since only the active effectiveness of the fortress can keep
enemy raiders within bounds. If this effectiveness is limited to its garrison,
the result will hardly be noticeable: the garrisons of these fortresses are
usually weak—infantry alone and not of the best at that. The idea of cover
will have more substance if the fortress is in touch with small units that use
it as a base and for support.

10. As the focal point of a general insurrection. In a guerrilla war, to be

sure, provisions, arms, and munitions are not issued on a regular basis.
Indeed, it is in the nature of that type of war that one must get along as best
one can, and thus discover countless minor sources of resistance, which
would otherwise remain untapped. Still, an important fortress stocked with
substantial amounts of such supplies can obviously intensify the whole
resistance movement, give it greater solidity, and lead to better cohesion
and results.

authorities, and treasury, as well as a point of assembly for larger
operations, and so forth. Above all, it will be the focal point for resistance;
during a siege the enemy’s forces are placed in a situation that facilitates
and favors attacks by local partisans.

serve so many purposes or play so many parts as when it is located on a
great river. Here it can assure a safe crossing at any time, prevent the enemy
from crossing within a radius of several miles, command river traffic,
shelter ships, close roads and bridges, and make it possible to defend the
river indirectly—that is, by holding a position on the enemy’s bank. It is
clear that this versatile influence greatly facilitates the defense of a river
and must rank as one of its essential elements.
  

open or close whole networks of roads that converge upon them, and
thereby dominate the whole area to which the roads give access. Thus, they
serve as veritable buttresses for their whole defensive system.

It will be clear that all requirements can be satisfied simultaneously if all

the largest and wealthiest towns in the area of the operational theater are
fortified—those that lie on the main highways linking the two countries,
and especially those located at ports and gulfs, on major rivers and in
mountains. Major towns and major roads always go together, and both have
a natural affinity for great rivers and the seacoast. These four requirements
will, therefore, coexist easily and cause no conflicts. Mountains are another
matter; there one will rarely find important cities. Therefore, if the location
and direction of a chain of mountains make it a suitable line of defense, it
will be necessary to block its roads and passes with minor forts especially
built for that purpose, and at the lowest possible cost. Large, elaborate
fortifications should be reserved for large towns in the plains.

So far we have paid no attention to frontiers, and have said nothing about

the geometric pattern of the line of fortification as a whole; nor have we
mentioned any other geographic aspects of their location. In our opinion,
the requirements already named are the essential ones, and in many
instances, particularly those of minor states, they will suffice. However
there are cases where other determinants are permissible and even
necessary. This is true of countries that extend over a larger area and
contain a number of important towns and roads, or, on the other hand, are
almost completely devoid of them; rich countries that desire to add to the
many fortresses they already possess, or, conversely, that are very poor and
are forced to make the best of very few; in short, cases where the fortresses

are disproportionate in number to the roads and cities, being either
substantially more or substantially fewer. Let us briefly consider these
additional factors.

The principal questions that remain are the following:

1. The choice of a main road, where there are more roads linking the two

countries than one would wish to fortify

2. Whether fortresses should be located only on the frontier or distributed

throughout the country

3. Whether to distribute them evenly or in groups
4. The geographic characteristics of the area that have to be taken into

account.

 
Several other points may arise from the geometric pattern of a line of

fortresses. Should they be placed in one or in several rows? In other words,
will they be more effective behind each other, or side by side? Should they
be arranged as on a checkerboard, or would it be better to place them in a
straight line with salients and reentrants as in individual fortresses? All
these questions, in our opinion, are sheer sophistry, considerations so trivial
that they are not worth mentioning when more important ones are
discussed. The only reason we touch on them at all is that they are not only
cited in so many books, but are given a great deal more weight than such
trivial matters deserve.

To clarify the first question, let us call to mind the relationship of

southern Germany to France—in other words, to the upper Rhine. If we
think of this area as a whole, to be fortified on strategic lines without
considering the individual states of which it is made up, we shall encounter
great problems because so many well-made roads run from the Rhine into
Franconia, Bavaria, and Austria. True, there is no lack of major towns, such
as Nuremberg, Würzburg, Ulm, Augsburg, and Munich; but if you cannot
fortify them all, you will have to make a choice. Further, while, in our
opinion, it is most important to fortify the largest and wealthiest towns, one
cannot deny that Nuremberg and Munich, being so far apart, will have
significantly different strategic values. One might, therefore, entertain the
question whether, instead of Nuremberg, one should not fortify a second
place, even if it is of lesser importance, in the vicinity of Munich.

question—must relate to what we have discussed in the chapters on
defensive plans in general and on the choice of objectives for an attack. The
points in immediate danger of attack are the ones that have to be fortified.

to our own, we shall preferably fortify the road that leads straight to the
heart of our country, or else the one that offers the greatest advantages to
the enemy in the way of fertile areas, a navigable river, and so forth. One
may then be certain that the enemy will either run up against one’s
fortifications, or, if he elects to circumvent them, we shall have the means
to execute a natural and favorable flanking operation.

Vienna is the heart of southern Germany, and Munich or Augsburg would

clearly be better places for the principal fortress than Nuremberg or
Würzburg, even against France alone—assuming Switzerland and Italy to
be neutral. This will become even more evident when one studies the roads
that come from Italy and lead from Switzerland and through the Tyrol; for
these, Munich and Augsburg retain some value, while Würzburg and
Nuremberg might as well be nonexistent in that respect.

Now let us turn to the second question, whether fortresses should be

located only on the frontier, or distributed throughout the country. To start
with, it must be noted that this is an academic question for small countries,
in which the frontier, from the strategic point of view, extends pretty much
over the whole area. The larger the state involved, the clearer the necessity
of posing this question.

The obvious answer is that the place for fortresses is on the frontier. They

exist to protect the country, and the country is protected if its frontiers are.
This answer may be valid in general, but the following observations will
show how subject it is to limitations.

Any defense that relies chiefly on outside help will set great store by

gaining time. It is not a vigorous counterattack, but rather a drawn-out
process in which the advantage lies more in gaining time than in reducing
the enemy’s strength. Other things being equal, it lies in the nature of the
case that if fortresses are spread throughout the country and cover a wide
area between them, they will take longer to capture than if they are densely
packed along the frontiers. Further, wherever the aim is to defeat the enemy
by the length of his line of communications and the difficulties of

maintenance—in countries, naturally, where these things can be relied on—
it would be absurd to build fortifications only on the frontiers. Finally, one
must remember that the fortification of the capital must receive priority
wherever circumstances permit; that, in accordance with our principles,
provincial capitals and commercial towns should also be fortified; that
rivers which traverse the country, mountain ranges, and other natural
obstacles will serve as additional defensive lines; that many towns with a
strong natural position are worth fortifying; and lastly, that certain military
installations such as munitions factories are situated better in the interior
than on frontiers and surely deserve to be protected by a fortress. Thus we
find that in some cases there may be more and in some cases less reason for
building fortifications in the interior of the country. Our feeling is,
therefore, that while states that have many fortresses will be correct in
locating most of them on the frontiers, it would still be a great mistake to
leave the interior completely unfortified. In France, for example, this
mistake is in our opinion astonishingly common. Some confusion may
understandably arise in this respect if, in the border areas, there are no
major towns at all, or where these are located further inland. This is the case
in southern Germany: there is hardly a major town in Swabia, whereas
Bavaria is full of them. We do not think it is necessary to solve this problem
once and for all, but believe that such cases must be determined by allowing
for the particular circumstances of each case. All the same, we would draw
attention to the closing remarks of this chapter.

evenly—is one that seldom arises, all things considered. Still, we would
not, for that reason, treat it as idle speculation: a group of two, three, or four
fortresses only a few days’ march away from a common center will give
great strength to that center and to the army based on it. Therefore, if other
conditions permit at all, one would be very tempted to create such a
strategic bastion.

The final point concerns the natural setting of the locations to be chosen.

A fortress will be twice as useful if it lies on the coast, on a stream or great
river, or in the mountains. As we have already pointed out, one of the main
requirements is then fulfilled. Still, there are several other aspects to be
considered.

If a fortress cannot be located directly on a river, it is better not to place it

in the immediate vicinity, but some fifty to sixty miles away; otherwise the
river will cut through and interfere with its sphere of influence with respect
to all the points mentioned above.105

This does not hold true in mountains: they do not limit the movement of

armed forces, large or small, to given points, as rivers do. But a fortress on
the enemy’s side of a mountain range is poorly placed because it is difficult
to relieve. Conversely, if it is located on the near side, the enemy will be
hard put to besiege it, for the mountains will obstruct his lines of
communication. Olmütz in 1758 is an example.

It will be self-evident that large impenetrable forests and marshes have

the same effect as rivers.

The question frequently arises whether towns in inaccessible locations

will make better or poorer fortresses. Since it costs little to fortify and
defend them, while an equal expenditure of strength will make them much
stronger and often impregnable, and since the services of a fortress are
always more passive than active, the objection that they are easy to
blockade need not in our opinion be taken very seriously.

In conclusion, let us review our straightforward system of fortifying a

country. We feel justified in claiming to have based it on important and
permanent considerations directly related to the vital affairs and interests of
the state. It is, in consequence, immune from transient military fashions,
flights of ingenious strategy, or the special needs of a given case—any one
of which could have unhappy consequences for a fortress built to last five
hundred or even a thousand years. Silberberg, built by Frederick the Great
on a ridge of the Sudeten mountains, has, under radically changed
conditions, lost practically all its purpose and importance; whereas Breslau,
if it had been and had remained a proper fortress, would have kept its value
under all conditions—against the French no less than against the Russians,
Poles, or Austrians.

The reader should not forget that our arguments are not intended to be

valid for a state that wants to build an entirely new set of fortifications.
Since this seldom, indeed practically never, happens, our arguments would
have been a useless exercise; but they might apply when any single fortress
is being planned.

One could go a step further and call all positions defensive in which an

army advancing toward the enemy would be ready to accept battle if the
enemy were to seek it there. This, in the last analysis, is how most battles
come about, and throughout the Middle Ages no other way was known.
However, that is not our present subject. Most positions are of this type, and
the concept of a position, as opposed to a temporary camp, would suffice
for present purposes. A position specifically designated as a defensive
position must, therefore, have additional characteristics.

It is obvious that decisions arrived at in ordinary positions are dominated

by the element of time. The armies march toward one another: where they
meet is a minor matter; all that counts is that the place be fairly suitable. In
true defensive positions, however, the element of place is dominant: the
decision must be reached at that place, or rather mainly because of that
place. This is the kind of position we are discussing here.

The element of place, then, has a dual aspect: first of all, a force in a

given position has a certain influence upon the whole; and second, the
position itself serves to protect the force and adds to its potentialities. In
brief, it will have strategic as well as tactical pertinence.

To be quite accurate, only the tactical aspect justifies the term “defensive

position.” The strategic aspect—the fact that a force positioned at that point
protects the country by its mere presence—could just as well be applied to
an attacking force.

The first of these two aspects—the strategic influence of a position—can

only be fully demonstrated when we come to discuss the defense of a

theater of operations; here we shall consider it only so far as can now be
done. For this purpose we must more closely examine two somewhat
similar concepts that are often confused: turning a position and by-passing
it.

attack it from the flank, or even from the rear, or to cut its lines of retreat
and communication.

The first of these—an attack on flank or rear—is tactical in nature.

Nowadays, when troops are extremely mobile and all operational plans are
aimed to some extent at turning or enveloping the enemy, any position must
be prepared for this eventuality; and a position that deserves to be called
strong must not only be strong in front but must also allow adequate scope
for fighting on the flanks and in the rear, if either should be threatened.
Thus, if the position is turned with the intention of attacking its flank or
rear, it will not be rendered useless. The battle taking place here was
determined by the position, and the defender should be able to benefit from
all the advantages for which he chose the position in the first place.

communication, he brings the strategic aspect into play, and the question
then is how long the position can be held and whether the enemy can be
beaten at his own game. Both depend on the actual location of the place—
chiefly that is, on the relation of the lines of communication of each side to
one another. Any good position should be sure of giving the defending force
superiority in that respect. At any rate, the position will not be rendered
useless by being turned; indeed, an enemy who attempts this type of
undertaking will at least be neutralized by it.

If the attacker, on the other hand, ignores the force that lies in wait for

him in a defensive position, and pursues his aim by leading his main force
forward by another route, he by-passes the position: and if he can do this
without loss, and really carries it off, he forces the defender to abandon the
position instantly—in other words, he makes it useless.

There is hardly a position in the world that is impossible to by-pass in the

literal sense of the term. Instances such as the Isthmus of Perekop are too
rare to deserve detailed consideration. What is meant by impossibility,
therefore, refers to the disadvantages that accrue to the attacker from by-
passing the position. Chapter Twenty-seven will offer a more suitable

opportunity for discussing these disadvantages; whether they be great or
small, they are the equivalent of the unexploited tactical effectiveness of the
position, and together with it they fulfill its function.

Two strategic features of a defensive position have thus emerged:

1. That it may not be by-passed
2. That it gives the defender an advantage in the struggle for lines of

communication.

 
Two other strategic features will now be added:

3. That the relation of the lines of communications also have a favorable

effect on the pattern of the engagement

4. That the general influence of the terrain be favorable.
 
The relationship of the lines of communication affects not only the

possibility of by-passing a position and possibly of cutting off its supplies
but also the whole course of the battle. An oblique line of retreat facilitates
a tactical turning movement by the attacker, and inhibits tactical movements
by the defender while the battle is in progress. An oblique disposition
relative to the line of communication is not, however, necessarily due to
faulty tactics, but may well be the result of a strategic error in the choice of
the position. For example, it cannot be avoided if the road changes direction
near the position (as at Borodino, 1812). The attacker is then headed in the
right direction for a turning movement without having to diverge from his
perpendicular disposition.

Moreover, if the attacker is able to retreat along a number of roads, while

the defender only has a single one, the former enjoys far greater tactical
freedom. In all such cases, the defender will struggle in vain to overcome
the disadvantages of the strategic error. He will not succeed.

Finally, with regard to the fourth point, other aspects of the terrain can be

so disadvantageous that the most careful choice and utmost ingenuity of
tactics will be of no avail. In that case, the following will be the main
considerations:

1. Above all, the defender must seek to keep the enemy under

observation, and be able to fling himself upon him within his own
immediate area. The defender will reap the benefit of the terrain only
where the natural obstacles of the environment combine with these two
conditions.

There is a disadvantage then, to all places that are dominated by

generally higher ground; all or most positions in mountainous areas
(which will be more specifically considered in the chapters on
mountain warfare); all positions with one flank protected by a
mountain (while the attacker will find these hard to by-pass, he will
find them easy enough to turn); any position with a mountain
immediately in front of it; and, in general, all cases that derive from
the above circumstances and their relation to the general conditions of
the terrain. Among the opposites of these disadvantageous conditions,
we shall only mention the case of a position backed by mountains.
Here the advantages are so many that it may be ranked among the best
conceivable places for the purpose.

2. The terrain may, to a greater or lesser degree, be suited to the army’s

nature and composition. Superiority in cavalry should cause us, with
good reason, to look for open ground. The use of rough and very
difficult terrain is indicated where there is a shortage of cavalry and
perhaps also of artillery, but where the infantry consists of brave men
who have experience in war and know the surrounding countryside
well.

 
There is no need to discuss in detail the tactical effect that the location of

a defensive position may have on the fighting forces. We shall simply
consider the result as a whole, for this alone has strategic significance.

Any position in which an army means to await the enemy’s attack should

obviously be one that offers solid advantages of terrain, which will in turn
serve to multiply the army’s strength. Where Nature helps a good deal, but
not as much as one could wish, entrenchment must come to one’s aid. By
this one can frequently make individual sectors—indeed, at times the whole
position—impregnable. In the latter case, the purpose of the measures that
will be taken has obviously changed completely. We are no longer seeking a
battle under favorable conditions—a battle intended to make a success of

the whole campaign. Our aim now is to succeed without any battle at all.
By keeping our fighting forces in an impregnable position we actually
refuse battle, and force the enemy to seek other ways of reaching a decision.

another. The second will be discussed in the following chapter under the
heading of “strong positions.”

simply an exceptionally advantageous battlefield. But if it is intended to be
a battlefield, the defensive advantages must not be too great. How strong,
then, should such a position be? Obviously, the more aggressive our
opponent, the stronger the position needs to be, and therefore each case
must be judged on its own merits. Against a man like Bonaparte, one can
and should retreat behind stronger ramparts than against a Daun or a
Schwarzenberg.

this should be considered as a single factor of its total strength, for it means
that forces not needed here may be used elsewhere. However, one should
not fail to recognize the fact that the enemy, in avoiding the unconquerable
parts, will alter the whole pattern of his attack. It remains to be seen
whether the new pattern suits our purposes.

so that the river serves to strengthen the front, as must have happened on
occasion. In effect the river has become a point of support for either the
right or the left flank, for the enemy naturally must make his crossing
further to the left or right and change his front in order to attack. The
principal question is, therefore, what advantages or disadvantages this has
for the defender.

strength is masked, and the more it lends itself to taking the enemy by
surprise in the course of the action. One always attempts to deceive the
enemy as to the true numerical strength of one’s fighting forces and their
true direction. By the same token, then, one should not let him see how one
intends to take advantage of the terrain. This is only possible up to a certain
point, of course, and perhaps calls for a special technique that has not yet
been attempted.

lends superiority to any position by increasing the mobility and usefulness
of its forces. Appropriate use of individual fieldworks can make up for lack
of natural strength at some point, permitting one at will to determine the
broad outlines of the engagement in advance. These are the reinforcements
that art can provide. Combining them with the correct choice of natural
obstacles (impeding the enemy forces without rendering them completely
ineffective) and the advantages that derive from knowing the battlefield
while the enemy does not, with our ability to conceal our arrangements
better than he can, and, in general, with our superiority in means of surprise
in the course of the action, can make the influence of the terrain itself
overpowering and decisive, so that the enemy will succumb without ever
knowing the real cause of his defeat. This is how we conceive of a
defensive position; it is in our opinion one of the greatest advantages of
defensive war.

Without making allowances for any special circumstances, one may

assume that undulating country, which is neither too closely nor too
sparsely cultivated, will afford the greatest number of positions of this type.

Fortified positions are not easily created by simple entrenchment, except

for entrenched camps close to fortresses. Still less are they created by
exploiting natural obstacles. Nature and skill usually work hand in hand in
their creation; therefore they are often referred to by the term entrenched
camps or positions. That name, however, can apply just as well to any
position improved by a few fieldworks—which is not the same as the
subject being discussed here.

The function of a strong position, then, is to make the forces holding it

practically unassailable. By doing this, it will either serve as a direct
protection of the area itself, or merely of the fighting forces stationed in the
area. They, in turn, will cover the country indirectly. The former was the
function of the lines in earlier wars, especially on the frontiers of France,
while the latter is the purpose of entrenched camps facing in all directions,
and of those in the vicinity of fortresses.

If, for instance, the front of a position has been made so strong by

fieldworks and obstacles to the approaches that no attack is possible, the
enemy will be forced to turn it and attack in flank or rear. In order to make
this more difficult, however, one would look for points of support for these
lines that could protect their flanks, such as the Rhine and the Vosges
Mountains for the lines in Alsace. The longer the front of such a line, the
easier it was to prevent its being turned, for a turning movement always
implies a certain risk to the force executing it, and the risk increases in
proportion to the amount of deviation from the original direction of the

forces. An extended length of front that could be made impregnable,
therefore, together with good points of support, would usually provide the
opportunity of directly protecting a considerable area from invasion by the
enemy. That, at least, was the original idea, and that was the significance of
the lines in Alsace, with their right flank on the Rhine and their left flank on
the Vosges, and of the lines in Flanders extending seventy-five miles, their
right flank resting on the fortress of Tournai and the Scheldt, and their left
flank on the sea.

When the means are not available for so long and strong a front and well-

supported flanks, if the area is to be defended at all by a well-entrenched
force, the latter will have to use all-round defense to protect itself from
being turned. The concept of an effectively covered area is lost: such a
position, strategically speaking, is only a point. The fighting forces are all
that is covered, and it is therefore up to them to hold the country, or rather
to maintain themselves in the country. It will be impossible to turn such a
camp, because it has no weak parts in flanks or rear that can be attacked: it
is all front, and equally strong everywhere. But a camp of that sort can be
by-passed—and much more easily than an entrenched line at that, for it has
next to no extension.

latter category: they are meant to protect their forces. Their broader
strategic significance, namely the employment of these protected forces,
differs somewhat from that of other entrenched camps.

the value of each of these three methods of defense. To distinguish them we
shall call them “fortified lines,” “fortified positions,” and “entrenched
camps near fortresses.”

obstacle they offer the attacker is worthless without powerful fire to support
it. Otherwise it is good for nothing. Moreover, the distance an army can
extend and still use its firepower effectively is minimal in relation to the
country; the lines will, therefore, have to be very short and thus cover very
little of the country, or the army will not be able to defend all points
effectively. The suggestion has, of course, been made that not all points
along the line need necessarily be occupied: they could merely be kept
under observation and defended by means of available reserves, much like

the defense of a moderate-sized river. But this device is inappropriate to the
means employed. Where the natural obstacles are so great that it could be
used, entrenchments would not be needed and would, in fact, be dangerous.
Lines are not appropriate to local defense, but entrenchments are. Where the
entrenchments themselves are supposed to be the main obstacle to access, it
will be plain that they are of little use if they are not defended. How much
use is a twelve- or fifteen-foot ditch, or a rampart ten or twelve feet high,
against a combined assault by several thousand men undisturbed by enemy
fire? The conclusion is that lines of that sort can be turned if they are short
and fairly well defended; if they are long and insufficiently defended, they
can be taken from the front without trouble.

Since lines of this type tie down the forces to local defense and rob them

of all mobility, they are a poorly designed device against an enterprising
enemy. If they nevertheless persisted in recent wars, the reason lies in the
nature of the wars, when apparent difficulties were often treated as real. In
most campaigns these lines were in any case only used as a supplementary
defense against raiders. As such they may have had some value; but one
must remember that the troops needed for their defense could often have
accomplished more valuable things at other points. They were out of the
question in the most recent wars, nor is there any sign that they were used.
One may doubt that they will ever reappear.

2. Positions. As we shall show in detail in Chapter Twenty-seven, the

defense of an area exists so long as the force entrusted with it can maintain
itself there. It does not end until that force withdraws from the area and
abandons it.

Consequently, if a force is to hold its ground in a country that is attacked

by a much more powerful enemy, one means of protecting this force against
overwhelming odds is to place it in an impregnable position.

defense. The normal width of a tactical disposition, where the force is not
very large (which would be contrary to the whole nature of the case) will
take up very little space—a space so small that in the course of the
engagement it would suffer from innumerable disadvantages; no matter
how much it was strengthened by ramparts of all kinds, there would be little
hope of making a successful stand. In a camp that is to present a front on
every side, all sides must be extensive as well as virtually impregnable. The

art of entrenchment alone will not be enough to provide for such strength
where extension is so great. It is therefore a fundamental condition that such
a camp should look for strength in natural obstacles that will make some
parts of it unapproachable and others very hard to reach. If this method of
defense is to be used, therefore, the right position must be found; one
cannot do it merely by entrenchments. These remarks apply to tactical
results and are meant to establish the existence of this strategic means. By
way of illustration, we would mention Pirna, Bunzelwitz, Kolberg, Torres
Vedras, and Drissa. Now let us consider its strategic qualities and effects.

The first condition, of course, is that the troops detailed to hold this camp

should have their food supplies assured for some time—that is, for as long
as one relies on the effectiveness of the camp. This can only be the case
where the rear of the position rests upon a port, as at Kolberg and Torres
Vedras; or, if like Bunzelwitz and Pirna, it is in close communication with a
fortress; or else if stocks have been built up in the camp or close at hand, as
was the case at Drissa.

only partially in the second and third. It will always be a source of risk. At
the same time it is clear that problems of supply rule out a good many
points that would otherwise have served for an entrenched position.
Suitable ones are consequently rare.

In order to gauge the effectiveness of such a position, to balance its assets

and liabilities, we must ask ourselves how an attacker is likely to react to it.
a. The attacker can by-pass the strong position, pursue his own designs, and
place it under observation by a suitable number of troops.

Here it makes a difference whether the entrenched position is held by the

main force or only by a subsidiary one.

passing it if there is an additional accessible and decisive object for him to
attack, such as a fortress, the capital, or the like. Even assuming that this
exists, he can pursue it only if the strength of his base and the location of
his lines of communication are such that his strategic flanks are in no
danger.

a strong position for the main force of the defender, is that it will be found
only where it is such a threat to the attacker’s flank that one can be sure to

pin him down where he can do no harm; or else if there is no objective in
his reach which might be of concern to the defense. Where there is such an
objective, and where, at the same time, the strategic flank of the enemy
cannot be seriously threatened, the position should either not be taken up at
all, or, if it is, only by a token force, simply to see if the enemy will respect
it. In that case the danger still exists, however, that if he does not do so, one
will no longer be able to relieve the threatened position.

If the fortified position is held only by a subsidiary force, the attacker

will never lack for another objective for his attack, which may be the main
army itself. The value of the position, in that event, is confined to the threat
it represents to the enemy’s strategic flank, and will be confined to this
condition.

b. If the attacker dare not by-pass the position, he can lay siege to it and

starve it into surrender. However, there are two prerequisites for this. The
first is that the position must not be open to the rear; and the second is that
the attacker must be strong enough for such an investment. If both
conditions are met, the position will, of course, neutralize the attacker for
some time; but the defender will have to pay for this advantage with the
loss of the defending force.

defending force is a measure to be taken only under certain circumstances:
(aa) if its rear is absolutely safe (as at Torres Vedras); (bb) if one can predict
that the enemy’s superiority will not suffice for a siege. If he does attempt it
without sufficient superiority, the defender will be able to make successful
sorties, and defeat the enemy in stages; (cc) if one can count on relief, as the
Saxons did at Pirna in 1756. Basically this was also the case after the battle
of Prague in 1757: Prague may be considered as an entrenched camp in
which Prince Charles would never have let himself be bottled up had he not
known that the army from Moravia could release him.

fortified position for the main defending force is to be justified. It must be
admitted, however, that the second and third of these conditions come close
to forcing the defender to accept a serious risk.

Where a subordinate corps is involved, however, one that can, if

necessary, be sacrificed for the benefit of the main force, these conditions
disappear. The only question then is whether the sacrifice will in fact avert a

greater evil. No doubt this will only rarely be the case, but it is not
impossible. It was the fortified camp at Pirna that prevented Frederick the
Great from invading Bohemia as early as 1756. Austrian unpreparedness
was so great at that time that Bohemia would surely have been lost, and the
resulting casualties might well have gone beyond the 17,000 men who
surrendered when Pirna fell.

outlined at a. and b. above. In that event, the conditions we prescribed for
the defender are fulfilled, and the attacker frankly has no choice but to
come to a halt facing the position, like a setter pointing at a covey. The most
he can do is to send out detachments and thereby spread his forces over the
area, contenting himself with that advantage, insignificant and indecisive
though it be, and wait for the future to decide the possession of the area. In
that case, the position has discharged its function to the full.

within the general category of fortified positions to the extent that their
purpose is to protect not an area but a force from enemy attack. The only
difference from other positions lies in the fact that they form an inseparable
whole with the fortress—a fact that, of course, adds immensely to their
strength.

They give rise to the following features:
a. They may serve the special purpose of making the siege of the fortress

either very difficult or impossible. This may be worth substantial casualties
if the fortress is a port that cannot be blockaded; in any other case, however,
the risk exists that the place may be starved into surrender too soon to
justify the sacrifice of a considerable number of troops.

smaller body of troops than would be feasible in the field. Within the walls
of a fortress, four or five thousand men may be invincible, whereas no camp
in the world would be strong enough to save them in the open field.

c. They may be used for the assembly and training of troops whose

morale is not strong enough for them to be exposed to the enemy save
under the protection of a fortress: recruits, militia, home guard, and the like.

Camps of this sort might thus be recommended for a number of useful

purposes, if they did not have the exceptional disadvantage of putting the
fortress in jeopardy when they cannot be occupied. On the other hand, it

would be much too heavy a commitment for a fortress to maintain a
garrison large enough to suffice also for the occupation of the camp.

only, but to consider them as more of a liability than an asset in all other
instances.

positions, as follows:

1. The smaller the country, and the less room for evasive movements, the

harder it is to do without such positions.

2. The greater the certainty with which help and relief can be relied upon

from other forces, the onset of bad weather, a popular insurrection,
shortages, or the like, the less are they a source of risk.

3. Their effectiveness will become greater, the weaker the impetus of the

enemy’s attack.

A flank position is any position that is meant to be held even though the

enemy may pass it by: once he has passed it, the only effect it can have is
on his strategic flank. Every fortified position is therefore a flank position:
since it is impregnable, the enemy has to by-pass it, and thereafter its only
value lies in the effect it has on his strategic flank. It does not matter which
way the real front of the position faces—whether parallel to the enemy’s
strategic flank as at Kolberg, or at right angles to it, as at Bunzelwitz and
Drissa. A fortified position must face in all directions.

But one may intend to hold a position that is not impregnable, even if the

enemy has passed it by. This would be the case if it were so well placed
with respect to the enemy’s lines of communication and retreat that not only
would an effective attack on his strategic flank be possible as he advanced;
in addition the enemy, being concerned about his own retreat, would not be
able to cut ours off altogether. If this were not the case, we would, since the
position is not impregnable, run the risk of fighting without any chance of
retreat.

In 1806, for example, the position of the Prussian army on the right bank

of the Saale could have become in every sense a flank position in relation to
Bonaparte’s advance through Hof, simply by having the front face the
Saale, and then waiting on events.

If there had been less of a disproportion of physical and psychological

forces, if the French army had been led by a man like Daun, the Prussian
position would have proven brilliantly effective. It was impossible to by-
pass: even Bonaparte admitted as much when he decided to attack it. Not

even he could cut it off entirely; and if the disproportion of physical and
moral forces had been less severe, trying to cut off the Prussians would
have been as impracticable as to move past them, because defeat of its left
wing constituted less of a danger to the Prussian army than the same thing
did to the French. In spite of the imbalance of both physical strength and
morale, determined and intelligent leadership would have provided
sufficient reason to hope for a victory. There was nothing to prevent the
Duke of Brunswick giving orders on the thirteenth for his 80,000 men to
confront, on the morning of the fourteenth, the 60,000 with whom
Bonaparte crossed the Saale at Jena and Dornburg. While his superiority in
numbers, together with the deep valley of the Saale in the rear of the
French, would not have sufficed for a decisive victory, one must recognize
that it was a very advantageous combination. If it would not have led to
success, then there should have been no thought of gaining a decision in
this area in the first place. The Prussians should have fallen back still
further, thereby adding to their own strength and reducing the enemy’s.

be considered as a flank position toward the road coming from Hof; but,
because of its vulnerability, it could not become one in an absolute sense
until the enemy made it so by not daring to attack it.

apply the term to positions that cannot maintain themselves when they are
by-passed, and from which the defender must therefore attack the enemy in
the flank; they would be called flank positions simply because that is where
the enemy has been attacked. This type of flank attack has little connection
with the position in itself; at least, it does not primarily result from the
nature of the position, as would be the case in an action against the enemy’s
strategic flank.

attributes of a flank position. But this may be a suitable place for a few
words about the character and implications of this expedient.

We shall not include genuine fortified positions, which have previously

been discussed at length.

but because of its vulnerability, it is a risky one. If it gives an attacker
pause, it produces a great effect with little effort, much like the pressure of a

rider’s little finger on the curb rein of the bit. If, however, the effect is
insufficient and the attacker is not checked, the defender will pretty well
have lost his chances of retreat. He must attempt a rapid escape by
roundabout routes, that is under most unfavorable conditions, or he will be
in danger of fighting without retreat being possible. If the enemy is daring,
superior in morale, and looking for a sweeping decision, this is a very
hazardous course, and far from suitable—as our example of 1806 has
shown. With a cautious opponent, on the other hand, and in a war of
observation only, it is one of the best means the defense can use. One will
find examples in Duke Ferdinand’s defense of the Weser River, taking a
position on its left bank, and in the well-known positions at Schmottseifen
and Landeshut. In the latter case, however, the disaster that befell Fouqué’s
corps in 1760 also shows the danger of using it incorrectly.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

We shall first consider the tactical aspects of the matter, from which we

can proceed to its links with strategy.

There is no doubt that the reputation for effectiveness and strength

enjoyed by defensive mountain warfare has traditionally derived from two
main factors: first, the difficulty of moving long columns over mountain
roads; and second, the extraordinary degree of strength attained by a small
post whose front is covered by a steep mountainside. while its flanks are
supported by deep ravines. Only the characteristics of armaments and
tactics at certain periods have prevented major forces from making use of
this effectiveness and strength.

A column toils at snail’s pace up a mountain through narrow gorges;

gunners and teamsters yell and swear as they flog their weary beasts along
the rocky tracks; each broken-down wagon has to be removed at the cost of
indescribable effort while behind it the rest of the column stops, grumbles,
and curses. At such a moment, each man secretly thinks that in this situation
a few hundred of the enemy would suffice to cause a total rout. Here one
can see the origin of the expression used by historians who speak of a gorge
so narrow that a handful of men could hold off an army. Still, anyone who
has experience in war will know, or should know, that such a march through
the mountains has little, if anything to do with an attack in them. It would

be quite wrong to infer from this particular difficulty that an attack would
be even more difficult.

that at certain periods military practice got entangled in the same error. At
the time, the phenomenon was almost as new to the veteran as it was to the
novice. Before the Thirty Years War the deep order of battle, the swarms of
cavalry, the crudeness of the firearms and various other factors made any
exploitation of the major obstacles of the terrain highly unusual. Methodical
defense of mountain areas, at least with regular troops, was practically
impossible. Not until a more extended order of battle came into use, and
infantry, and with it firearms, became the dominating component of an
army, did it dawn on anyone that good use could be made of heights and
valleys. Even then, it took another hundred years—approximately till the
middle of the eighteenth century—for it to be developed to its full potential.

an almost inaccessible point—reinforced the belief in the greater
effectiveness of defense in mountains. It seemed as if all one had to do was
to increase such positions in order to transform a battalion into an army, and
a mountain into a mountain range.

Undeniably, in a mountainous area a small post in a favorable position

acquires exceptional strength. A unit that on open ground can be dispersed
by a couple of cavalry squadrons, and will think itself lucky if it can escape
capture or annihilation by rapid retreat, can face an army in the mountains.
By a kind of tactical effrontery, one might say, it can exact from a whole
army the military tribute of a full-scale attack, an envelopment, and so on.
The manner in which it adds to its power of resistance through obstacles,
flank-support and new positions taken up as it retreats is a question of
tactics; we accept it here as a matter of fact.

would result in a strong, almost impenetrable front. One only had to guard
against being outflanked by extending the position to right and left until it
reached adequate points of support, or until one believed that the extension
alone was enough to prevent the position from being turned. In that respect
a mountain area is very tempting; it offers such a wealth of defensive
positions, each better than the last, that it is hard to know where to stop.
One ended up by occupying and defending every point of access within a

given area, and believed that if one occupied a space of fifty miles or more
with ten or fifteen posts, one would at last be safe from the horror of
envelopment. Since these positions seemed firmly linked by inaccessible
terrain (columns not being able to march across broken country), one
appeared to confront the enemy with a wall of bronze. For extra safety, one
retained a couple of infantry battalions, some horse artillery and a dozen
cavalry squadrons in reserve, just in case the enemy should by fluke
succeed in breaking through.

cannot be said that people have completely shed this error.

increased in size, also contributed to strengthen the apparent defensive
significance of mountainous terrain for military action.

The leading feature of defensive mountain warfare is its decisively

passive character. It was therefore natural enough to have recourse to it
before armies achieved their present state of mobility. The number of troops
had steadily increased, and, to utilize their firepower they were increasingly
deployed in long thin lines, elaborately linked and very difficult, if not
impossible, to maneuver. Deploying an intricate machine of this kind could
take half a day; it made up half the battle and included practically
everything that can be found in a modern battle plan. Once all this had been
accomplished, it was difficult to make changes if different circumstances
arose. It followed that an attacker who delayed drawing up his line of battle
could then do so on the basis of the defender’s position, and the latter was
unable to respond. The attack thus acquired an overall superiority, and all
the defense could do was to protect itself by means of natural obstacles.
Nothing served that general purpose more effectively than mountains. One
therefore aimed, so to speak, at a union of the army and suitable terrain;
united they made common cause. The battalion defended the mountain, and
the mountain defended the battalion. A mountain area thus conferred a high
degree of strength on passive defense, and was not in itself a disadvantage,
except that it resulted in an additional loss of mobility—which no one had
been adept at using anyway.

side, always attracts the enemy’s attack. If a defender’s posts are strong and
impenetrable, transfixed, so to speak, and immobile, the attacker will be

emboldened to turn them, because he will not have to worry about his own
flanks. That indeed is what happened, and soon it was the order of the day.
In response, positions became more and more extended, and their front
became proportionately weaker. Then the attacker changed his method: he
no longer tried to outflank the enemy by outextending him, but massed his
strength against a single point and pierced the line. This was roughly the
stage reached by defensive mountain warfare at the end of the recent wars.

increasing mobility. Only mobility could strengthen the defense, but
mobility is inhibited by mountainous terrain. As a result defensive mountain
warfare has (if we may use such an expression) suffered a defeat; just as
armies did so frequently when they attempted this kind of defense during
the Revolutionary Wars.

In order not to throw the baby out with the bath-water and be swept along

by the stream of platitudes into assertions that can be disproved in practice a
thousand times by actual experience, we must distinguish the effects of
defense in mountains according to the nature of the individual case.

The central question to be decided here, and the one that sheds the

greatest light on the whole subject, is whether resistance in defensive
mountain warfare is intended to be relative or absolute. Is it meant to last
only a certain time, or to end in definite victory? Mountains are eminently
suited to defense of the first type, because of the increased factor of
strength. For the second type, on the other hand, they are, except for a few
special cases, generally not suited at all.

time, and if it is made within range of the enemy, it also costs more lives.
The resistance encountered by the attacker is measured in expenditure of
time and lives. Therefore the defender has a clear advantage so long as
movement is only up to the attacker; the advantage vanishes as soon as the
defender has to move as well. It is basic, and tactically necessary, that
limited resistance allows for far more passivity than an aim of outright
victory. Passivity, moreover, can continue indefinitely—right to the very
end of the engagement. That would be impossible in the case of absolute
resistance. The impeding characteristic of mountain country, a sort of
viscous element that clogs and stultifies initiative, is therefore the ideal
setting for this purpose.

strength in mountainous terrain. While this tactical result needs no further
proof, one further explanation is necessary: one has to distinguish whether
the size of a unit is small in an absolute or a relative sense. If a force of any
given size decides to station a single unit in an isolated spot, that unit may
find itself under attack by the whole enemy force—in other words, by
superior forces, compared to which it is quite small. In that event, it can, as
a rule, merely hope to put up relative, rather than absolute, resistance. The
smaller the unit in relation to its own main force and to the enemy’s, the
more this applies.

enemy no stronger than itself, that could expect to offer absolute resistance
aimed at actual victory, will be infinitely better off in the mountains than
would a large army. It will make better use of the terrain, as we shall
explain in more detail later.

in mountain country. It is plain enough that this can be of decisive value
whenever limited resistance is required; but will it have the same decisive
value for the absolute resistance of an army? That is the question we must
now investigate.

posts be so strong proportionately as each single one of them, as has
hitherto been assumed? Certainly not: that assumption is the result of one of
two possible errors.

one. Where one is not able to march in a column, or with artillery or
cavalry, one can, in most cases, still advance with infantry, or make some
use of artillery: the brief exertions involved in movements during battle
cannot be measured by the standards of a march. The belief that posts enjoy
secure communications with each other therefore rests on a complete
illusion, and one that endangers their flanks.

on their front are just as strong on their flanks, because a ravine, a precipice,
or the like make good points of support for a small post. But why do they?
Not because they make a post impossible to turn, but because they burden a
turning movement with a cost in time and effort that has to be measured

against the post’s significance. The enemy who wants to and has to turn
such a post despite the difficulties of terrain because a frontal attack is
impossible may easily spend half a day on this maneuver, and may still not
be able to accomplish it without casualties. If a post of this type is
dependent on help, or if it is intended to hold out for only a limited time, or,
finally, if its strength is equal to the enemy’s, the points of support of the
flanks have done their job, and it would be true to say that the post was
strong not only frontally, but on its flanks as well. However, this does not
hold in the case of a chain of posts that are part of an extended position in
the mountains. Here, none of those three conditions is fulfilled. The enemy
attacks a single point in superior strength; support from the rear is
negligible, and yet the situation calls for absolute defense. The post’s points
of support are worthless under such conditions.

assault by concentrated and therefore vastly superior forces on a single
point on the front will meet with fierce resistance when measured by the
strength of that point; but measured by the whole, that resistance is
negligible. Once it has been overcome, the line is pierced and the objective
is achieved.

in the plains; that it is most effective, relatively speaking, in the case of
small posts; and that it does not grow in proportion to the forces engaged.

We now turn to the true object of every large engagement—positive

victory. This must be the aim of defensive mountain warfare wherever the
whole force or a major part of it is involved. In that event, defensive
mountain warfare automatically turns into a defensive battle in the
mountains. Its form now becomes that of a battle: the whole force is
committed to the purpose of annihilating the enemy, and victory is the
object of the engagement. The defensive mountain warfare which is here
involved is secondary; it is no longer the end, but the means. That being the
case, what is the relation of the mountain area to this end?

Characteristically, a defensive battle calls for passive reaction at the front,

and increased active reaction in the rear; but mountainous country tends to
produce paralysis. Two factors are at work. First of all, there are no roads
that allow for rapid marching from the rear to the front. Even a sudden
tactical assault is hampered by the uneven nature of the ground. Second, it

is impossible to keep the area and the movements of the enemy under
observation. Thus the attacker gets the same advantages from the terrain
that had accrued to our front, while the better part of the defense is
completely paralyzed. Now a third factor comes into play: the risk of being
cut off. No matter how much a retreat, in the face of pressure on the front, is
favored by mountainous terrain, no matter how much time the enemy loses
by attempting a turning movement—these advantages only matter in the
case of a relative resistance. They have no bearing on a decisive battle in
which resistance must be maintained to the last. Granted, it will take a little
longer for the enemy’s flank columns to occupy the points that threaten or
even cut off our retreat; but once he is there, no relief is possible. No
offensive from the rear can dislodge him from the points that threaten the
retreat; no desperate assault by the entire force can subdue him where he
blocks the way. If this seems to be a contradiction, and one believes that the
advantages that mountains afford the attacker must also accrue to the force
that tries to cut its way out, one should not forget the difference of their
circumstances. The corps that attempts to block the way is not meant to
render an absolute defense; a few hours’ resistance may be enough. Its
situation therefore is that of a small post. Moreover, its opponent is no
longer in control of all his means of operation; he is in disorder, short of
ammunition, and so forth. In any case, the prospects for success are slight;
it is this danger that causes the defender to fear this situation more than any
other. This fear spreads through all phases of the battle and weakens the
contestant’s every fiber. His flanks become abnormally sensitive; indeed,
every handful of soldiers that the attacker deploys within view on a wooded
slope in the rear provides new leverage toward his victory.

These disadvantages would vanish to a large extent, while all the

advantages would remain, if the defense of the mountains could be
conducted by an army concentrated on an extensive mountain plateau. Here
it would be possible to envisage a strong front, flanks difficult of access,
with, on the other hand, complete freedom of movement within and in rear
of the position. Such a position would rank as one of the strongest possible.
However, this is little better than an illusion: while most mountain ranges
are somewhat more accessible from the rear than up their slopes, most
plateaus are either too small for such purposes, or the term plateau does not

rightfully apply to them—it may refer to geological rather than
topographical considerations.

the mountains tend to diminish for smaller units. The reason is that smaller
forces need less room, fewer lines of retreat, and so on. One mountain does
not constitute a range, nor does it possess its disadvantages. The smaller the
unit, the more its position will be limited to single mountains and ridges,
and the less it will be forced to involve itself in the densely wooded
labyrinth of steep and narrow gorges, which is the source of all these
troubles.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

The following aspects are to be distinguished:

1. The mountain area as a battlefield
2. The effect that its possession has on other areas
3. Its effectiveness as a strategic barrier
4. The problems of supply to which it gives rise.
 
In the first and most important aspect we must further distinguish

between a. a major battle, and b. secondary engagements.

We have pointed out in the previous chapter that in a decisive battle,

mountainous terrain is of no help to the defender; on the contrary, that it
favors the attacker. This is in direct contradiction to the general opinion; but
then, general opinion is usually in a state of confusion, and unable to
distinguish between diverse aspects of a question. People are so much
impressed by the powerful resistance of a minor unit that they assume that
all defensive mountain warfare possesses extraordinary strength. They are
surprised when the existence of such strength in the core of all resistance,
the defensive battle, is denied. On the other hand, they are always ready to
blame the incredible mistake of cordon warfare for the loss of any defensive
battle in the mountains, completely ignoring the force of circumstances that
are inevitably involved. We are not afraid of being in direct conflict with
such opinions. On the other hand, we are gratified to have found support in
the writings of an author who, for several reasons, commands respect in the
matter—Archduke Charles, in his histories of the campaigns of 1796 and
1797. Charles was a sound historian, a shrewd critic, and, what counts even
more, a good general.

The defender, though outnumbered, has gathered his forces with

deliberation and at great pains, in order to impress the attacker, at the time
of the decisive battle, with his patriotism, enthusiasm, and keen
intelligence. All eyes are upon him. We therefore cannot help but find it
regrettable if he chooses to take up a position in the twilight area of densely
wooded mountains, fettered in his movements by the unrelenting terrain,
and open to countless forms of attack by his numerically superior opponent.
The opportunity to exercise his intelligence is limited to one area only: the
full use of natural obstacles. That device, however, brings him dangerously
close to cordon warfare, which can be ruinous and should be avoided at any
cost. In case of a decisive battle, therefore, we are far from regarding
mountainous terrain as a refuge for the defender; on the contrary, we would
advise any commander to avoid it if at all possible.

One must admit that it is not always possible. The character of the battle

will then be markedly different from what it would have been in the plain.
His positions will be far more extended—usually two or three times as long.
Resistance will be much more passive, and counterattacks less violent. Such
are the unavoidable conditions of mountainous terrain; still, the defensive in
such a battle should not fall back on defensive mountain warfare. Rather, its
chief characteristic in the mountains should be that of a concentrated
disposition of its forces, fighting a unified battle under a single commander,
with enough reserves left over to make the decision count for more than a
mere repulse, or shielding action. This is an indispensable condition, but a
very difficult one to meet; and it is so easy to slide into defensive mountain
warfare that it is not surprising that it should happen so often. But it is so
dangerous that the theorist cannot overstate his warnings.

So much for a decisive battle involving the main force.
In the case of engagements of lesser importance and significance, on the

other hand, mountains can offer infinite advantages, because absolute
resistance is not needed and no decisive results will follow. Let us clarify
this by listing the objects of such resistance:

a. Simply to gain time. This is a very common object. It is always present

if a defensive position has been formed for gathering intelligence, and
also in any case where reinforcements are expected.

Where a province is protected by a mountain range, no matter how
lightly the range is defended, the defense will at any rate suffice to
prevent enemy raids and other plundering expeditions. Without a
mountain range, such a weak chain would be absurd.

correct view on the subject of mountain country to gain recognition.
Until then, one may find opponents who are afraid of it and who are
immobilized by it. In cases of this kind, even the main force may be
used to defend a mountain range. This is a common situation in a war
fought without great energy or movement; but the condition that must
remain constant is that one neither has the intention of accepting, nor
of being forced into, a major battle in this position.

which one does not intend to accept a major engagement, because in
the mountains each unit is stronger individually; only their aggregate
strength will be less. Moreover, it is easier to avoid being taken by
surprise there and to be forced into a decisive encounter.

support from small regular units. The proximity of the main force, on
the other hand, seems to work to its disadvantage. An insurrection
therefore seldom justifies leading an army up into the mountains.

 
So much for mountains from the point of view of battle positions.
2. The effect that possession of mountains has on other areas. We have

indicated the ease of securing a substantial sector in the mountains by
means of minor posts—posts which would be too small to maintain
themselves, and so in constant danger if they were more accessible. When
the enemy holds the mountains, every advance takes much longer than in
the plain, and therefore cannot be expected to keep the same pace. It
follows that in mountains possession is a much more important aspect than
in any other area of equal size. Open country can change hands from one
day to the next. One need only advance some strong detachments in order
to make the enemy relinquish the desired area. This is not the case in
mountains, where much smaller forces can put up a serious resistance: if
one desires to seize a mountainous sector, a special operation is required

demanding the expenditure of much time and effort before the area can be
taken. Even though a mountain range may not be the arena of the principal
action, it should not be treated as being completely dependent on that action
—which would be the case with a more accessible region. Its seizure and
occupation must not be considered as an automatic consequence of the
advance.

Mountain country, then, has far more independence. Its possession is

more absolute, and less liable to change. Moreover the outer slopes of a
mountain range usually afford a good view of the surrounding countryside,
whereas its own interior is shrouded, so to speak, in deepest night. One can
understand, then, that for anyone faced with mountains he does not hold, a
mountain range represents a perennial source of unfavorable influence and
a secret forge of the enemy’s strength. That impression is heightened if the
enemy not only holds the mountains, but is their rightful owner. This is
where the smallest bands of courageous partisans can find refuge from
pursuit, only to break through, unharmed, at a different point. The strongest
columns can pass through them unobserved; and the attacker’s forces must
keep at a considerable distance in order to avoid being drawn into their area
of dominance, there to be involved in an unequal fight consisting of sudden
assaults and blows which they are powerless to return.

a certain radius, on the low-lying country around it. It will depend on local
conditions whether this effect is direct, for instance on the outcome of a
battle (as at Malsch on the Rhine in 1796), or will be felt on the lines of
communication only after a certain time. Whether or not it can be
overwhelmed and swept away by decisions reached in the valley or on the
plain depends on the forces involved.

about the Tyrol; but Moreau had to abandon Swabia in 1796 mainly because
he did not hold the hill country, and had to devote too much of his strength
to its observation. In a campaign that sways to and fro, with evenly matched
forces, one does not like to be exposed to the constant disadvantage
represented by mountains that remain in enemy hands. One will, therefore,
try to take and hold the part necessary to the main lines of one’s offensive.
That is why, in such cases, mountains tend to be the principal scene of
minor actions between the two armies. One must be careful, however, not to

overrate this by always treating mountains as the key to the whole situation,
and their possession as one’s chief concern. When victory is at stake, one’s
chief concern is victory; once it has been won, the rest of the situation can
be dealt with as circumstances warrant.

to be distinguished here. Once again, the first is a decisive battle. One can
treat the mountains as a river—an obstacle with certain points of access. It
provides an opportunity for a victorious battle by splitting the enemy’s
advance and confining him to certain roads, thereby enabling us to assault
part of his force with all of our own, which has been massed on the other
side of the mountains. Even if the attacker disregards all other factors, there
is one decisive reason why he cannot march through mountains in a single
column: he would be exposed to the fatal risk of having to fight a decisive
battle with only a single line of retreat. Certainly, then, this method of
defense is based on cogent arguments. However, since the terms
“mountains” and “mountain access” are very vague, everything depends on
the terrain itself. The method can, therefore, be indicated merely as a
possibility, which also involves two disadvantages. The first is that an
enemy who has suffered a defeat will easily find refuge in the mountains;
and the second, that he will be the one who holds the higher ground. That
may not be a decisive factor, but it is a disadvantage for the defender.

unless one counts the one Alvinczy fought in 1796. But Bonaparte’s
crossing of the Alps in 1800 shows that it is possible: Melas could and
should have fallen on him in full strength before he had assembled his
columns.

lines of communication where it intersects them. Quite apart from forts that
block the passes or the effects of a general insurrection, poor mountain
roads in bad weather can be enough to drive an army to despair. More than
once they have forced an army to retreat, having first utterly worn it out. If,
in addition, there are constant raids by partisans, or even a general
insurrection, the enemy will have to send out large expeditions, and, finally,
occupy strong points in the mountains. He will then be entangled in the
most adverse situation possible in offensive war.

and straightforward matter. The greatest advantage that can accrue to the
defender in this respect arises when the attacker either has to remain in the
mountains, or at least has to leave them in his rear.

These reflections on defensive mountain warfare basically apply to

mountain warfare in general, insofar as they also illuminate the concept of
offensive war. They will surely not be considered incorrect or impractical
simply because mountains cannot be turned into plains, or vice versa, or
because the choice of a theater of operations is governed by so many other
factors that there seems to be little scope for arguments of this sort. That
scope, however, is not so limited when it is applied to large-scale
operations. When the problem is how to dispose the main force to best
advantage—especially at the moment of decisive battle—a few extra
marches to the front or rear are enough to bring the army from the
mountains to the plains: when the whole force is firmly concentrated there,
the neighboring mountains will be neutralized.

Having thrown light on the matter in general, we shall once more bring

the picture into sharp focus.

unsuited to defensive warfare, from the point of view of both tactics and
strategy. Defense, in this sense, is of the decisive kind that determines the
question of possession of the country. Mountains reduce one’s control, and
impede movement in all directions; they impose passivity, and, by requiring
every means of access to be blocked, they almost always lead to some
degree of cordon-warfare. Whenever possible one should therefore keep
one’s main force out of the mountains, leaving them to one side, or taking
up a position in front of or behind them.

objectives, mountain country makes for greater strength. Based on what we
have previously stated, it will not be inconsistent to call it a true refuge for
the weak—for those no longer able to seek an absolute decision. Its very
suitability for minor operations is another reason for excluding major
forces.

the psychological impact. The imagination, not only of the novice, but also
of those who have been trained in the wrong methods, will be

overwhelmingly impressed by the difficulties posed by mountainous terrain,
which, like a dense, hostile element, impedes all the attacker’s movements.
Such people will, therefore, be hard put not to consider our opinion as the
most fantastic paradox. When one takes a more general view, the history of
the eighteenth century, with its peculiar form of warfare, takes the place of
such impressions. For instance, some will never be persuaded that it would
have been easier for Austria to defend herself on the Rhine than in Italy.
The French, on the other hand, having made war for twenty years under
vigorous, ruthless leadership, with the successes of this method strongly
impressed on their minds, will for a long time to come be foremost in
applying sound instinct based on practiced judgment to this as to other
situations.

country than in mountains; that Spain would be stronger without the
Pyrenees, Lombardy less accessible without the Alps, and a flat country
such as northern Germany more difficult to conquer than a mountainous
one such as Hungary. Those deductions are false, and that brings us to our
concluding observations.

but we do hold that a Spanish army that felt it had the strength to risk a
decisive battle would be wiser to make a concentrated stand behind the
Ebro than to split up among the fifteen passes of the Pyrenees. This is not
going to obviate the effect of the Pyrenees on the war. We believe the same
to hold true of an Italian army. Scattered among the Alpine peaks, it would
be no match for a resolute opponent, and have no choice of victory or
defeat; but on the plains of Turin its claims would be as strong as those of
any other army. Still no one will be ready to believe that an attacker likes to
march across a mountain massif like the Alps, and to leave it in his rear.
Moreover, acceptance of a major battle in the plains does not necessarily
imply that there can be no preliminary defensive action by minor units in
the mountains. In ranges such as the Alps or the Pyrenees that sort of action
would be advisable. Finally, we are far from asserting that a country in the
plains would be easier to conquer than a mountainous one unless a single
victory sufficed to disarm the enemy completely. After such a victory the
conqueror assumes a posture of defense, mountains will then be as
awkward for him as they were for the defender—even more so. Should the

war go on, should outside help arrive for the defender, should the people be
up in arms, each of these reactions will be reinforced by the mountains.

when it is moved in a certain direction, but only until the focus is reached.
Once one has passed that point, the effect is reversed. If defense is weaker
in the mountains, it might encourage the attacker to choose a mountain
route for his advance. However, this will happen only rarely: problems of
supplies and roads, uncertainty as to the enemy’s accepting battle in the
mountains and deploying his main force there, are enough to offset any
possible advantages.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

Mountain ranges often stretch across the surface of the earth like bands

or belts, forming the divides between entire systems of irrigation. Their
basic forms repeat themselves in its lesser parts, with ridges and valleys
issuing from the principal range and forming smaller watersheds in turn.
Hence it was natural for defensive mountain warfare to be thought of in
terms of the principal mountain range, an obstacle of length rather than of
breadth, which acted like an extensive barrier. Geologists may not yet be
agreed on the origins of mountains or the laws of their development; in any
case, the pattern of the watercourses is the most direct and reliable guide to
the structure of the system—whether it was itself shaped by their effect,
through erosion, or whether the course of the water is the result of the
structure. It was natural, therefore, in planning defensive mountain warfare,
to be guided by the watercourses. Not only do they provide a natural series
of levels that enable one to plot the mountain’s general height and profile
with accuracy, but the valleys they form will always be the shortest, safest
means of access to the heights. In any case, this much is known about
erosion: it will always tend to wear uneven slopes into a single, regular
curve. The theory of defensive mountain warfare that resulted would treat a
mountain range that ran generally parallel to the front as a major obstacle to
the approach, a kind of rampart, whose points of entry were formed by the
valleys. The actual defense would be conducted on the highest ridge (that
is, on the edge of the highest plateau in the range) and its line would cut
across the major valleys. If the range were to run more at right angles to the

defensive front, the defense would be conducted on one of its major spurs;
it would then run parallel to a major valley and up to the principal
watershed, which would be considered as its terminal point.

structure, has here been outlined because for a time it actually occupied the
imagination of theorists; indeed, in the so-called theory of terrain, the laws
of erosion had been absorbed into the conduct of war.

All this, however, is so full of erroneous assumptions and of loose

analogies that there is not enough left on which to base any serious practical
system.

inaccessible to hold troops in any numbers. The spurs are often just as bad
—too short and too irregular in shape. Plateaus do not exist on every
mountain ridge, and, where they do, they are generally too narrow and
inhospitable. Indeed, on close examination, it is very rare to find a mountain
range that rises to a single, unbroken ridge with sides that fall away in
anything like regular slopes or a series of terraces. The main ridge twists
and turns and forks into mighty spurs, which curve far out into the land and
often end in peaks that rise to greater heights than the main ridge itself.
Adjacent foothills form great valleys, which will not fit into the system.
Add to this that at the points where several mountain ranges meet, or from
which they originate, the notion of a narrow band or belt must be discarded
altogether and replaced by that of a star-shaped group of watersheds and
mountain chains.

It must follow—and anyone who has studied mountains from this point

of view will feel it even more strongly—that the idea of a systematic
deployment of troops must be rejected as being too unrealistic to serve as a
basis for a general plan. But we must note another important point in the
area of practical application.

problems stand out. They are the defense of steep mountains and the
defense of narrow valleys. The latter, which frequently, indeed usually,
affords greater effectiveness to defense, is not easily combined with
positions on the main ridge: often the valley itself must be occupied—
usually at the point where it opens out from the mountain massif, rather
than higher up where it originates and where its sides are very steep. The

defense of valleys, furthermore, provides a method of defending mountain
country even when it is out of the question to station troops on the main
ridge. The part it plays increases in importance therefore with the height
and inaccessibility of the massif.

of a fairly regular defensive line that coincides with a basic geological
feature. Mountains should be thought of simply as a flat surface strewn with
irregularities and obstacles of every sort, each part of which one seeks to
use to the best advantage possible. In short, while knowledge of the
geological structure of the terrain is essential to a complete grasp of the
shape of the mountain massif, it will rarely be evident in the organization of
defense.

the defense followed its basic features, will be found in either the War of
the Austrian Succession, or the Seven Years War, or the wars of the
Revolution. Armies were never found on the principal ridge, but always on
the slopes: higher up or lower down; facing this way or that—parallel, at
right angles, or oblique; following the watercourse or crossing it; in the
higher ranges, such as the Alps, often even continuing along a valley floor;
and, greatest anomaly of all, in the minor ones, such as the Sudeten,
halfway up the slope opposite the defender, so that the main ridge faced
them. This was the position with which Frederick the Great covered the
siege of Schweidnitz in 1762, with the heights of the Hohe Eule facing the
front of his camp.

War were located, for the most part, on the valley floor. The same holds true
of the Feldkirch position in the Vorarlberg. In the campaigns of 1799 and
1800, both the French and the Austrians set their main posts up in the
valleys proper—not merely spanning them so as to form barriers, but along
their entire length, while the ridges were either left unoccupied, or were
occupied by only a few isolated posts.

The ridges of the High Alps are, in fact, so inaccessible and inhospitable

as to rule out holding them with significant forces. If one insists on
stationing troops in mountainous areas in order to control them, one cannot
help but station them in the valleys. At first sight, this must seem absurd,
for the accepted theory is that valleys are controlled by ridges. But in

practice things are not as bad as that. The ridges can only be reached by a
few tracks and paths, and usually only on foot. All the roads are in the
valleys. Consequently, only at isolated points could the enemy’s infantry
put in an appearance; but distances in such mountain ranges are too great
for small firearms to be effective. Thus, positions in the valleys are less
dangerous than they appear. Admittedly, however, defense in valleys is
exposed to another serious danger—that of being cut off. The enemy, it is
true, can get infantry down to the valleys only at a few points, and even
then he can only do so slowly and with great effort. Hence there can be no
question of surprise; but if no posts defend the points where these paths
open into the valley, the enemy will eventually succeed in descending with
superior numbers and fanning out. He will then be able to pierce the fragile
line, which has now become quite weak, its only protection being the stony
bed of a shallow mountain stream. A retreat that has to take place along the
valley floor by bounds until an exit from the mountains has been found,
becomes impossible for many parts of the line. That explains why, in
Switzerland, the Austrians almost always lost a third or half their men as
prisoners.

Now a few more words about the extent to which forces on such a

defensive mission are usually divided.

along the principal approach, more or less near the center of the general
line. To the right and left of that point, other units will be sent to occupy the
most important points of access, and the whole will therefore form a
position of three, four, five, six or more posts, more or less in a line. How
far it is necessary or wise to extend the position will depend on individual
requirements. A few marches’ length, say thirty to forty miles, is a
reasonable extension, and cases are on record where the position ran to 100
or 150 miles.

Between the single posts, which are a few hours’ distance from one

another, one will easily find other, less important access routes, favorable
positions for a few battalions, well suited for liaison between the chief
positions. These will accordingly be occupied. One can easily imagine that
the forces could be even further subdivided, down to single companies and
squadrons—which has in fact often been done. Indeed, there is no general
limit to the splintering process. On the other hand, the strength of the

individual posts depends on the strength of the whole; and that alone makes
it impossible to state the probable or natural degree of strength maintained
by the chief positions. For guidance we merely offer a few propositions
derived from experience and the nature of the case.

1. The higher and less accessible the mountains, the more the forces may

be split: indeed, the more they must be split, because the smaller the
area that can be secured by combinations based on movement, the
more its security must be taken care of by direct coverage. Defense in
the Alps requires far greater subdivision, and comes much closer to the
cordon method, than defense in the Vosges or in the Riesengebirge.

2. So far, in defensive mountain warfare, forces have been usually

divided so as to give a single line of infantry to the principal posts,
supported by a few cavalry squadrons. Only the main force, which is
stationed in the center, might possibly have a few battalions in the
second line of battle.

3. There have only been very few cases of a strategic reserve being kept

in the rear to reinforce points under attack: a front so widely stretched
was generally thought too weak at all points to start with. Support for
posts under attack, therefore, was generally brought up from other
posts in the line that had not been attacked themselves.

4. Even where forces had not been greatly subdivided, and individual

posts were therefore fairly strong, the main resistance offered by them
always took the form of local defense. Once the enemy was in full
possession of a post it was considered past recovery by any
reinforcements that might reach it.

 
How much one can expect from defensive mountain warfare; when it

should be used; to what lengths one can, and may, go in extending and
subdividing the forces—these are matters that the theorist must leave to the
discretion of the general. It is enough for a theorist to describe the means
and the part they play in military operations.

A general who allows himself to be decisively defeated in an extended

mountain position deserves to be court-martialled.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

Like mountains, they reinforce a limited defense; but their peculiar

characteristic is that they act like a tool made of a hard and brittle
substance: they either stand the heaviest blow undented, or their defensive
capacity falls to pieces and then ceases completely. If the river is very wide,
and all other conditions are favorable, a crossing may be absolutely
impossible. But once the defense is breached at any point, the kind of
resistance in depth that would occur in mountains does not take place. The
matter is settled in this single act, unless the river happens to flow through
mountainous terrain.

The other attribute of rivers in their relation to combat is that they

generally permit of more favorable, and in some cases excellent tactical
possibilities for a decisive battle; usually better ones than do mountains.

What rivers and mountains have in common is that they are dangerous

and alluring objects, which have often led to wrong decisions and into
dangerous situations. When we come to a more detailed discussion of river
defense, we shall call attention to these implications.

Historical examples of the successful defense of rivers are fairly rare,

justifying the view that they are not such formidable barriers as people used
to think in the days when systems of absolute defense used every means of
reinforcement offered by the terrain. Still, a river is undoubtedly an asset to
the engagement as well as to the defense of the country in general.

In order to provide some cohesion and perspective, we shall list the

various aspects from which the subject will be examined.

must be distinguished from the influence they exert on the defense of the
country without themselves being defended.

The significance of the defense proper may be of three different types:

1. Absolute resistance by the main force
2. A mere show of resistance
3. Limited resistance carried out by subordinate elements such as

advance posts, covering lines, detached corps, and so forth.

 
Finally, we have to distinguish three main degrees, or types, that the form

of the defense may take:

1. Direct defense intended to prevent a crossing
2. A more indirect form, in which the river and its valley serve only as

components for a more favorable tactical development

3. An absolutely direct defense, which consists of holding an unassailable

position on the enemy side of the river.

 
These three degrees will form the framework of our discussion; and when

each has been examined in the light of the first and most important
consideration, we shall conclude by taking up the other two considerations.
First, then, let us look at the direct defense, which attempts to prevent the
enemy army from crossing the river.

This can only apply in the case of major rivers—that is, great bodies of

water.

The combination of space, time, and strength that must be considered as

the basic elements of this theory of defense makes this a fairly complicated
matter. Consequently, it is not easy to find a fixed point of departure. Upon
careful thought, one will arrive at the following conclusion.

The intervals at which the units defending the river should be stationed

are determined by the time required to build a bridge. One must divide the
total length of the defensive line by these intervals in order to find the
number of units; then divide this number into the total strength available, to
find the strength of each individual unit. By comparing that figure with the
number of troops with which the enemy can cross the river by using other

means while the bridge is being built, one can gauge the chances of a
successful defense. Unless the defense is able to attack any enemy units that
get across before the bridge is finished, in really superior strength—say two
to one—it would be dangerous to assume that the enemy could not force a
crossing.

build his bridge. If he cannot get more than 20,000 men across in that time
by using other means, and if the defense can concentrate that number at any
point in twelve hours or so, no crossing can be forced; 20,000 men will be
there by the time the enemy has ferried across half that number. Allowing
for the time that messages will take, one can march twenty miles in twelve
hours; 20,000 men would therefore be needed for every forty miles, or
60,000 men for the defense of 120 miles of river front. That would be
sufficient for 20,000 men to be sent to any point even if the enemy tried to
cross at two points simultaneously, and with twice that number if he did not.

The three governing factors are as follows: (1) the width of the river; (2)

the means of crossing it, since both together govern the time it will take to
build a bridge and the number of men that can get across while it is being
built; (3) the strength of the defending force. The attacker’s strength is not
relevant at this stage. This theory would lead to the view that there is a
point at which a crossing completely ceases to be possible and at which no
degree of superior strength can force it.

This is the basic theory of the direct defense of a river—that is to say, a

defense intended to prevent the enemy from finishing his bridge and from
crossing the river by other means. It does not take into account the effect of
any demonstrations that the enemy may employ. We shall now examine the
particular circumstances and the measures required by this type of defense.

If, to start with, one disregards all geographical details, it will be enough

to state that the units required, according to this view, must be stationed
directly on the river bank, each one in concentrated formation. They must
be on the river bank because any position further back adds needlessly to
the distances that must be traversed. Since the width of the river covers the
position against any serious enemy activity, there is no need to keep it at a
distance like a reserve force in an ordinary defensive line. Besides, the
roads running parallel to a river are generally more passable than those
leading down to it. Finally, there is no doubt that this type of position will

make possible better observation of the river than would a mere chain of
posts, chiefly because all senior officers will be close at hand. Each unit
must be kept concentrated, otherwise our calculations would have to be
altered. Anyone who knows how long it takes to assemble a unit will
recognize that to have the units already concentrated will assure the greatest
effectiveness of the defense. At first sight it may be very tempting to set up
a line of posts to stop the enemy crossing by boat; but save at the few
points, especially suitable for ferrying, such a disposition would be most
unwise. Aside from the danger that the enemy can generally reduce such a
post by superior fire power from the opposite bank, it is likely to be a total
waste of strength: all that is accomplished by such a post is that the enemy
will choose a different point for crossing. Unless, therefore, one is strong
enough to treat and defend the river like a moat around a fortress—in which
case one needs no additional advice—this defense of the river bank itself
will necessarily be unproductive.

In addition to these general principles of disposition, we must take into

account, first, the individual characteristics of the river; second, the removal
of all means of crossing; and third, the effect of fortresses on the river.

If one considers the river as a defensive line, it must have points of

support at each end, such as the ocean or neutral territory, or other factors
that will prevent the enemy from crossing above or below the defended
sector. Such points of support or other conditions will occur only if the line
is extremely long, and it becomes evident that the defense of rivers must
extend over considerable distances. It is therefore not a practical proposition
(and we need not bother with any other kind) to defend a river by massing a
large force on a relatively short stretch of it. By a relatively short stretch of
river front, we mean a distance not much greater than the normal extension
of a position where there is no river. We maintain that cases of that sort do
not occur; any direct defense of a river must always be extended until it
amounts to a kind of cordon system. It is, therefore, ill-advised to counter
any enemy envelopment by methods that would be natural in a concentrated
deployment. Hence, where an envelopment is possible, the direct defense of
a river, however promising under other circumstances, is a very risky affair.

As to the river between these limits, obviously not all points are equally

suited to a crossing. We can discuss this further in a general way, but we
cannot actually categorize the possibilities, since the slightest local

variation often outweighs the most massive arguments in books. Such
categorization would in any case be entirely useless; one look at the river,
combined with information received from the local inhabitants, will provide
guidance, and there is no need to resort to books.

crossing are roads running down to the river, tributaries flowing into it,
large towns located on its banks, and, above all, its islands. On the other
hand, features that tend to be stressed in the literature, such as the greater
elevation of one of the river’s banks, or a bend in its course at the point of
crossing, have seldom proved of great significance. The reason is that the
influence exerted by these factors is limited to the narrow concept of an
absolute defense of the banks, a matter that rarely, if ever, arises in the case
of the largest rivers.

bound to affect the position, and to modify the general mathematical rule in
some respects; but it would not be wise to stray too far from this rule and
rely too heavily on the difficulties presented at certain points. The enemy
will choose the places least favored by nature if he can be sure that he will
be least likely to meet us there.

In any case, one measure that can be recommended is the strongest

possible occupation of the river’s islands. A serious attack on them is the
safest clue to the intended point of crossing.

down as the situation may require. If no existing road runs parallel to the
river the improvement of the nearest parallel track, or, alternatively, the
construction of short stretches of new roads, can be counted among the
most important preparations the defense can make.

The second point under discussion is the removal of the means of

crossing. This is not an easy matter on the river proper, and is, at any rate,
very time-consuming. On the tributaries, especially those on the enemy’s
side, it is next to impossible, for they are usually already in the enemy’s
hands. It is most important, therefore, to seal off the mouth of every
tributary with fortifications.

—are seldom sufficient for major rivers. Consequently, a great deal will
depend on the materials for building boats and rafts that he can find on the

river itself and on its tributaries, in the large towns along its banks, and
finally in adjacent woods. There have been cases in which all of these
circumstances work against him to such an extent as to make a crossing
virtually impossible.

alone. They not only serve as protection against a crossing in their vicinity,
whether up- or downstream, but also as a means of sealing off the
tributaries and of storing material that could be used for crossing.

of water. The addition of a deep and narrow gorge, or marshy banks, will, it
is true, increase the difficulties of crossing and the effectiveness of the
defense; but these can never replace a large body of water, for they do not
constitute the major break in terrain which is the first requirement for direct
defense.

in the strategic plan of a campaign. One must admit that it can never lead to
a decisive victory: partly because its intention is not to permit the enemy to
cross, but to crush the first substantial force he has landed; partly because
the river itself prevents us from exploiting with an energetic counterattack,
any advantages gained.

time—and time, after all, is what the defender is most likely to need. It
takes time to assemble the means of crossing. If several attempts at crossing
fail, even more time will have been gained. If the enemy changes his
direction because of the river, still other benefits will no doubt fall to the
defense. Finally, in all cases where the enemy is not determined on an
advance, the river will put a halt to his movements and serve as a permanent
protective barrier for the country.

Where two substantial forces are involved, the river is broad, and

conditions are favorable, the direct defense of a river can be considered an
excellent device, and may yield results which, in recent times, have
received too little attention due to failures that were caused by insufficient
means. The above-mentioned requirements are, after all, easily met by
rivers like the Rhine and the Danube. If one can maintain an effective
defense against substantially superior forces over 120 miles of river front by
means of 60,000 men, one may well consider it a noteworthy achievement.

the theory we have outlined, everything depends upon the means of
crossing, and nothing on the force that seeks to cross, provided it is not
inferior to the defending force. Strange as this may seem, it is nonetheless
true. But one must not forget that most or practically all river defenses have
no absolute points of support. They can all be turned; and great superiority
in numbers will greatly facilitate the turning operation.

One must also remember that such a direct defense, even if it is

overwhelmed by the enemy, cannot be equated with a lost battle. Even less
can it lead to complete defeat: only part of our troops will have been
involved, and the enemy, delayed by his slow passage across the bridge,
cannot immediately follow up his victory. For all these reasons, one should
not underrate this method of defense.

What matters in all practical affairs is to find the valid point of view.

Thus, in the defense of a river, it makes a great difference whether we have
a correct impression of the whole position: some apparently trivial element
may significantly alter the situation. What may have been a sound, effective
measure in one case may be a disastrous mistake in another. The difficulty
of judging everything correctly and refraining from assuming that one river
is like another is perhaps greater in this instance than elsewhere. That is
why we must constantly be on guard against the danger of applying the
wrong methods or misinterpreting the facts. We must add unequivocally,
however, that we consider it beneath our dignity to notice the clamor of
those whose vague emotions and still vaguer minds impel them to expect
everything from attack and movement, and whose idea of war is summed
up by a galloping hussar waving his sword.

always enough (we need only cite the once famous “dictator” Wedel at
Züllichau in 1759);106 but what is worse, most of the time they are
inapplicable. They leave the commander in the lurch at the very moment
when he is beset by a mass of highly complex problems.

In our opinion, then, as long as one aims no higher than a modest

negative, the direct defense of a river with a large number of troops and
under the right conditions can bring about good results. But this does not
apply to minor units. While 60,000 men along a given stretch of river front

are able to stop 100,000 from crossing, 10,000 along the same stretch will
not be able to stop a corps of 10,000—probably not even half that number
provided these are willing to run the risk of placing themselves on the same
side of the river with a defender so superior in numbers. The point is clear,
for the means of crossing are the same in either case.

So far we have said little on the subject of feints, since they rarely play a

role in the direct defense of a river. Part of the reason is that such a method
of defense does not require the concentration of an army at one point, but
gives each unit its own sector to defend, and partly it is because, under the
conditions assumed here, the pretense of a crossing is an extremely difficult
affair. Where the means for a crossing are themselves scarce—less than the
attacker feels he needs to ensure the success of his operation—he can
hardly want, or afford, to earmark a considerable part for a feint. In any
case, it would diminish by that much the size of the forces he can get across
at the real crossing point. The other side gains thereby in time what it might
have lost through uncertainty.

The direct defense of a river is suitable as a rule only for the very largest

European rivers, and only on the lower half of their course.

The second form of defense is suited to minor rivers and deep valleys—

frequently even for insignificant ones. It consists in taking up a position
farther to the rear. The distance should be such as to make it possible either
to catch the enemy army in separated units if it crosses at several points, or,
if it crosses at a single point, to catch it close to the stream, where it is
confined to a single bridge or road. An army whose rear is up against a river
or cramped in a deep valley, which is limited to a single line of retreat, is in
a most disadvantageous situation for battle. The defense of all moderate-
sized rivers and deep valleys consists in exploiting these circumstances.

The deployment of an army in large units close to a river—which we

consider best for direct defense—assumes that the enemy cannot cross by
surprise and in great strength; otherwise, the risk of being separated and
beaten individually would be too great. Thus, if conditions are not
sufficiently favorable to the defense of the river, if the enemy can lay his
hands on too many means of crossing, if the river has too many islands or
even fords, if it is not wide enough, or if our forces are too weak, this
method of defense must not be considered. The troops, in order to stay in
close touch with one another, must be withdrawn some distance from the

river. What remains to be done is to converge as rapidly as possible on the
enemy’s crossing point and attack him before he holds enough of the river
bank to enable him to cross at several other points. In this case, the river or
the valley must be watched and lightly defended by a chain of outposts,
while the army, divided into several corps, takes up a position at appropriate
points some distance from the river—normally a few hours’ march away.

The important feature here is the passage through the narrow river valley.

What counts is not only the body of water as such, but the passage as a
whole. As a rule, a deep, rocky gorge is of greater significance than a river
of considerable width. The difficulties presented by the march of a
substantial body of troops through a narrow passage are actually much
greater than they appear to be at first glance. The time it takes is
considerable, and the risk that the enemy will meanwhile seize the
surrounding heights is most disquieting. If the leading units get too far
ahead, they will meet the enemy too soon and are in danger of being
crushed by a superior force; if they remain near the crossing point, they will
be in the worst possible position for fighting. Crossing such a divide with
the idea of facing the enemy on the other side is therefore extremely daring
or presupposes a great superiority in numbers and self-confidence on the
part of the commander.

would be in the case of the direct defense of a major river: one wants to
fight with the total force united, and no matter how difficult the crossing
points they cannot be compared to those of a major river. The enemy is
therefore in a much better position to turn our line. On the other hand, this
will take him away from his real direction (assuming, of course, that it runs
approximately at right angles to the divide) and the handicap of a narrowed
line of retreat is not overcome all at once, but only by degrees. The
defender therefore still retains a few advantages over the attacker even if he
does not catch him at the critical stage, but only after his envelopment has
given him somewhat greater scope.

water, but, almost more to the point, with the deep depressions formed by
their valleys. We must, therefore, above all make it clear that we do not
mean regular mountain valleys, since in that case everything that has been
said about mountain warfare would apply. But there is much open country

where even the smallest streams run between high, precipitous banks.
Besides, marshy banks and other obstacles to approach belong in this
category.

behind a fair-sized river or a deep valley is very advantageous; this type of
river defense must be counted among the best strategic devices.

in the overextension of his forces. It is only natural, in such a situation, to
string out one’s forces from one crossing point to the next, and not to know
where to stop. But if one cannot fight with the army united, the whole
enterprise has failed. A lost engagement, an unavoidable retreat, confusion,
and casualties of all kinds may bring the army to the brink of total disaster,
even if it does not fight to the last.

that, in every case, one must be able to assemble one’s troops by the end of
the day on which the enemy has crossed. This principle will take the place
of all further discussion about time, strength and space, which depend on a
variety of local factors.

characteristic: the defender must show the utmost impetuosity. The feints
with which the enemy may well have kept him guessing for a time will
generally allow him to get to the right place only at the last minute. The
special advantages of his situation lie in the difficult position of those
enemy troops that are directly opposite him. If additional forces arrive from
other crossing points and envelop him, he cannot deal with them in the
normal way by sustained counterattacks from the rear. If he did, he would
sacrifice the advantages of his position. He must decide the issue before
these additional troops begin to press him—in other words, he must attack
whatever troops are before him with the utmost speed and vigor, and
through their defeat reach a decision for the encounter as a whole.

One must remember that the objective of this type of river defense can

never be to resist a vastly superior force, as it might perhaps be in the case
of the direct defense of a major river. Usually one will have to deal with the
largest part of the enemy’s force and even if this happens under favorable
conditions, it is easy to see that the disparity of strength must be reckoned
with.

where large forces are involved; forces which seek a decisive victory and
for whom the effective resistance that can be sustained on the rim of the
valley bear no comparison with the drawbacks of a dispersed position. If all
that is needed, however, is the reinforcement of a secondary line of defense,
which is meant to resist for a time and depends on the arrival of
reinforcements, a direct defense of the ridges and even of the river bank
would indeed be in order. While one cannot expect the advantages of a
mountain position, resistance here can be kept up longer than it would in
ordinary country. The one condition under which it can be really risky, or
impossible, is where the river winds in hairpin bends, which is just what
rivers in deep valleys are apt to do. (Consider the course of the Moselle in
Germany.) In such a case, the units holding the salients formed by the bends
would almost certainly be lost in the event of a retreat.

have attributed to rivers of medium size where the bulk of an army is
engaged, and under much more favorable conditions. Such a defense will
invariably be employed where the defender aims at total victory. Aspern is a
case in point.

stream, or a deep valley immediately to its front, in order to gain a tactical
obstacle to approach, a tactical strengthening of its front. A closer study of
this belongs to the realm of tactics, but in terms of its effectiveness, we can
only call it pure self-delusion. If the divide is great enough, it will make the
position’s fronts impregnable, but since it is no more difficult to by-pass
than any other, the effect is almost as if the defender had evaded the
attacker—which was hardly the point of occupying the position in the first
place. This type of position, therefore, is of use only where local conditions
make the attacker’s lines of communication so unfavorable that any
departure from the most direct route would involve unacceptable
consequences.

attacker will find them easier to make, while the defender will still have to
concentrate his whole force at the real point of crossing. However, the
defender will not be quite so pressed for time, for the advantage will remain
with him until the attacking force is fully massed and has taken several

crossing points, while enemy feints will never be so effective as they will be
with a cordon-defense, where no ground can be yielded at all. When it
comes to using the reserve, therefore, the problems are very different. In
one case, it is simply a matter of knowing the whereabouts of the main
enemy force; in the other, it is the far more difficult problem of guessing
which will be the first point to be overrun.

We would add a general comment on the subject of either form of

defense of major or minor rivers: if they have been adopted in the hurry and
confusion of retreat, without preparation, without taking away the means of
crossing, and without familiarity with the terrain, they cannot possibly yield
the results described above. Usually nothing of the sort can be expected,
and so it will be a grave mistake to spread a force too thin over an extended
position.

In any case, since everything is apt to go wrong in war unless it is done

with full awareness, firmly and wholeheartedly, the same will hold true of
defending a river for fear of meeting the enemy in open battle and in the
hope that the width of the river or the depth of the valley will stop him.
Such decisions show a lack of confidence in the situation; they often fill the
general and the army with dire forebodings, which usually come true only
too quickly. After all, a battle in open country is not like a duel that
presupposes equal terms: the defender who is unable to find an advantage
by exploiting the special nature of defense, or by using rapid marches, or by
familiarity with the terrain and freedom of movement, has little to hope for.
Least of all can he look to a river or its valley for salvation.

on the enemy’s side of the river. Its effectiveness is based on the risk
incurred by the enemy that the river traverses his lines of communication,
once he had crossed it, and thus would limit him to one or two bridges.
Obviously, this will be the case only with major rivers that run broad and
deep; it would not apply to a river with a narrow valley, which usually has
many crossing points.

The position must be strongly fortified—practically impregnable.

Otherwise we would play into the enemy’s hands, and our advantage would
be lost. If, however, it is strong enough to deter the enemy from attack, the
effect may be to tie him down to the bank. If he were to cross, he would
expose his lines of communication—though, of course, he would also

threaten the defender’s. Here, as in all cases where two armies pass each
other by, the crucial question is whose lines of communications are the
more secure—in number, position, and other respects. In addition, it
depends on which side has more to lose, and is therefore more easily outbid
by the other; and finally, whose army retains the greater determination on
which it can draw as a last resort. The river contributes nothing, except to
increase the danger of any such movement for both sides, because both are
confined to bridges. Insofar as one can normally assume the defender’s
crossing points and his various depots to be better fortified than his
opponent’s, this is a perfectly feasible form of defense which will suffice
where other circumstances do not favor a direct defense. Admittedly, it
means that the army is not defended by the river, or the river by the army;
but the country is defended by the combination of the two, which is what
really matters.

decisive blow, is like the tension set up in the atmosphere between positive
and negative electric currents: it will only be able to stop a blow of minor
proportions. It might suffice against a cautious, hesitant general who is not
compelled to press on even when he has greatly superior strength; it might
also do if the armies were already in a state of balance, with neither of them
looking for more than minor advantages. But as a means of coping with
superior numbers and a dashing general it is a dangerous course, leading
close to disaster.

scientific that one might almost call it elegant; but since elegance easily
comes close to fatuousness—which is less excusable in war than in society
— few examples of this elegant method exist. It can, however, be developed
into a special means of support for the first two methods: by holding a
bridge and a bridge-head, one can always threaten a crossing oneself.

these three forms of river defense may have a further one: that of feigned
defense.

number of other measures, and basically with any position that is not simply
an overnight camp. But the feigned defense of a great river becomes an
effective deception if it involves a number of more or less complex

measures. The effect is usually larger in scale, and lasts longer than in other
cases. The act of crossing a river in the face of an enemy is always a serious
decision for the attacker. He is apt to consider it at length or postpone it
until a more favorable time.

river in approximately the same way as it would in the case of a real
defense. However, the intention of a mere feint proves that circumstances
are not favorable enough for a real defense. It follows that the positions you
take up—which are inevitably more or less extended and scattered—may
well give rise to serious losses if the units really get involved in resistance,
on however limited a scale. That would actually be a half-measure.
Therefore, in a feigned defense everything must be calculated in terms of a
real concentration of the army at a point considerably further to the rear—
frequently as far as several days’ march. One can render only as much
resistance as is consistent with that plan.

To explain exactly what we mean, and at the same time show the

significance that such a show of resistance can have, we recall the final
phase of the campaign of 1813. Bonaparte had returned across the Rhine
with 40,000 to 50,000 men. With so small a force it would have been
impossible to defend the length of this river between Mannheim and
Nijmwegen—the stretch where, according to the general direction of its
forces, the allied army would be most likely to cross. The only practical
thing Bonaparte could do was to plan his first real stand on the French part
of the Meuse, where his army could expect reinforcements. If he had
withdrawn to that line at once, the allies would have followed hard on his
heels; the same would have happened before long if he had sent his troops
to rest-camps on his own side of the Rhine. No matter how cautious and
faint-hearted the allies might have been, they would have sent swarms of
Cossacks and other light troops across, and if these had succeeded other
units would have followed. In consequence the French had no choice but to
prepare to defend the Rhine in earnest. Since it was to be expected that, as
soon as the allies really started to cross, nothing would be accomplished by
this defense, the whole maneuver has to be considered as a mere show of
resistance in which the French, in fact, were risking nothing, since their
point of assembly was located on the upper Moselle. Only Macdonald,
stationed at Nijmwegen with 20,000 men, made the mistake of waiting to

be driven out. Because of the late arrival of Wintzingerode’s corps, this did
not happen until the middle of January, and prevented Macdonald from
rejoining Bonaparte before the battle of Brienne. The feigned defense of the
Rhine, then, sufficed to bring the allies to a halt and make them decide to
postpone the crossing until the arrival of reinforcements—a period of six
weeks. These six weeks must have been of incalculable value to Bonaparte.
Without the show of resistance on the Rhine, the battle of Leipzig would
have led the allies straight to Paris; a battle anywhere east of Paris would
have been quite beyond the powers of the French at the time.

—one that involves a river of medium size. But it will normally be much
less effective, because the mere attempts at crossing are easier and therefore
the game is given away sooner.

even less effective. It would hardly be of more use than any other temporary
position.

Finally, the first two forms of defense are well suited to confer much

greater strength and security on a chain of outposts or other defensive line
established for some secondary purpose (a cordon), or even on a small
observation corps, than these would possess without the river. In all these
cases, we are talking only about relative resistance, which will become
much more effective wherever a break in the terrain exists. But we must
keep in mind not only the fairly long time gained by resistance during the
actual engagement but also the many doubts that accompany the planning
of the attack, which in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred will cause it to be
cancelled unless there are urgent reasons to proceed.

substantial natural obstacle, and as such it is generally an asset for the
defense; but the salient features of its actual role can be defined in greater
detail.

To start with, we must establish whether the river runs parallel, diagonal,

or at right angles to the border—that is, to the main strategic front. If it does
run parallel, we must distinguish whether it runs behind the defender’s army
or the attacker’s; and in either case, it makes a difference how far away the
army is from the river.

A defending army with a major river close (but no less than a normal

day’s march) behind it, a river on which it has secured a sufficient number
of crossing points, is undoubtedly in a much stronger position than it would
be without the river. While concern for its crossing points may deprive it of
some liberty of movement, it will gain a great deal more through the
security of its strategic rear, especially of its lines of communication. It
must be understood that we are talking about defense on one’s own
territory; on hostile territory, even where the enemy army is in one’s front,
one must expect him in one’s rear as well once one has crossed the river.
Then the river would be more of a disadvantage than an advantage, because
it constricts our communications. The further distant the river is from the
army, the smaller its usefulness; and at a certain distance, its value vanishes
altogether.

If an advancing army has to leave a river in its rear, the river is bound to

impede its movements, because the lines of communication will be limited
to a few crossing points. In 1760, when Prince Henry marched against the

Russians along the right bank of the Oder near Breslau, the river, which was
only a day’s march to his rear, clearly gave him a point of support. Later on,
by contrast, when the Russians crossed the Oder under Chernichev, they
were in a most uncomfortable position simply because of the risk of losing
their line of retreat, which depended on a single bridge.

Where a river runs more or less at right angles across a theater of

operations, the advantage again lies on the side of the defender. To start
with, he will usually have a choice of good positions by using the river as
support and the tributary valleys as reinforcements for his front (as the
Prussians used the Elbe in the Seven Years War); second, the attacker must
either leave one side of the river alone or split his forces. In the latter case,
the defender will doubtlessly be favored by virtue of having a larger number
of safe crossings than the attacker. A glance at the Seven Years War is
enough to demonstrate that the Oder and the Elbe were of great help to
Frederick in defending his theater of operations—that is to say, Silesia,
Saxony, and the Mark—and, conversely, constituted a decided obstacle to
the Austrian and Russian conquest of these provinces. Yet neither river was
really defended during the course of the war. Moreover, for the most part,
both ran diagonally or at right angles to the enemy’s front more frequently
than they ran parallel to it.

Generally speaking, a river’s role as a means of transportation is its most

favorable aspect as far as the attacker is concerned, provided it runs at right
angles to the front: his lines of transportation are longer and he therefore
has greater problems in moving up his supplies. Water transport will,
therefore, come as a relief and be an advantage. It is true that here too the
defender has the advantage of being able to close the river to traffic by
means of fortresses from the border on; but this does not counteract the
benefits that the attacker reaps up to that point. Still, several factors must be
called to mind. A river may be wide enough to be of some military
significance without necessarily being navigable; it may not be navigable
all year round; river traffic upstream is extremely slow and often difficult;
frequent bends may more than double the distance to be traveled; highways
nowadays serve as the main arteries between two countries; and finally, the
bulk of an army’s needs is at present raised through local requisitioning
rather than through commercial procurement from distant places. These
considerations make it clear that water transport plays a much smaller part

in the supply of armies than textbooks would have us believe. Its effect on
the course of events is therefore quite remote and hard to measure.

CHAPTER TWENTY

A. Defense of Swamps

The principles of using them defensively are of course much the same as

for rivers; still, they have some special features that must be noted. The first
and foremost is that unless there are dikes, a swamp is impassable for
infantry. It is far more difficult to cross than any river. For one thing, a dike
is not so quickly built as a bridge; for another, there are no temporary means
by which troops can get to the far side to cover its construction. One would
never start to build a bridge without using boats to ferry over an advance
guard, but with a swamp this is impossible. The simplest way of getting
infantry across is by means of planks; but that is a tedious business, and if
the marsh is of some width, it takes infinitely longer than getting the first
boats across a river. If in the middle of the swamp there is also a river that
cannot be crossed without a bridge, the task of getting the first troops across
becomes even more difficult: planks may be enough for men to cross one
by one, but not for transporting heavy bridging material. Under some
circumstances this difficulty may prove insurmountable.

Another characteristic of marshes is that one is never able to demolish a

means of crossing entirely, as one can in the case of a river. One can
dismantle a bridge, or destroy it enough to make it unusable, but the most
one can do to a dike is to breach it—which is not doing much. If a stream
flows through the swamp, one can indeed demolish the bridge crossing it,
but this will not impede the crossing as a whole to the same extent as would
the destruction of a bridge over a major river. The natural consequence is

that existing dams must always be fairly strongly held and seriously
defended if the marsh is to be of any military advantage.

facilitated, on the other hand, by the difficulties of crossing elsewhere.
These two factors combine to make the defense of swamps more local and
more passive than that of rivers.

Consequently, one will have to muster greater strength, relatively

speaking, than for the direct defense of a river. In other words, one cannot
rely on so long a line of defense, especially not in closely settled parts of
Europe, where even under the best of circumstances the crossing points
tend to be quite numerous.

In that respect, then, marshes are not so useful as great rivers, and this is

an important difference; since there is always something very insidious and
dangerous about localized defense. Yet one must bear in mind that most
marshes and bogs are a great deal wider than the widest rivers of Europe;
that therefore there is never any danger that a post set up to defend a
crossing point will be neutralized by fire from the opposite bank; that on a
long narrow dike the effect of one’s own fire is considerably raised; and
that, in general, incomparably greater delays will be encountered in filing
along a narrow track a mile or two long than in crossing a bridge. It must be
admitted then—provided there are not too many crossing points—that such
swamps and marshes are among the strongest lines of defense possible.

streams—using a natural obstacle for the favorable initiation of a major
battle—may just as easily be applied in the case of swamps.

However, the third form of river defense—by means of holding a

position on the enemy side—would be too dangerous because it takes so
long to cross the swamp.

It would be most hazardous to get involved in the defense of any

swamps, water meadows, bogs, or marshes that might possibly be crossed
by passages other than dikes. The enemy’s discovery of a single such
crossing point may be enough to breach the whole line of defense; which in
the case of serious resistance will lead to heavv losses.

B. Inundations

Admittedly, inundations are rare. The Netherlands are quite possibly the

only country in Europe where they constitute an element that deserves our
attention. Indeed, it is this very country which, because of the remarkable
campaigns of 1670 and 1787, and because of its geographical relation to
Germany and France, obliges us to devote some consideration to the matter.

The characteristics of flooding in the Netherlands differ from ordinary

swampy and impassable bogs in the following ways:

1. The country itself is dry, and consists either of dry meadows or of

fields under cultivation.

2. The land is intersected by a number of irrigation channels and drainage

ditches of varying width and depth, running parallel to one another in
certain areas.

3. Major canals for the purposes of irrigation, drainage and navigation

traverse the land in all directions. They run between embankments and
can only be crossed by bridges.

4. The elevation of the ground in the whole area subject to flooding is

well below sea level, and consequently also below the level of the
canals.

5. It follows that the whole area can be flooded by breaching the dams

and opening or closing the sluice gates. Only the roads that run along
the higher dams will remain dry. The rest are either under water or
become so waterlogged as to be unfit for use. Even where the flood
level is no higher than three or four feet, possibly enabling one to wade
short distances, this is prevented by the smaller ditches mentioned at
point 2 above, which can no longer be seen. Only where these ditches
run in the right direction so that one can wade between them without

having to cross any of them, can flooding be considered anything but a
total barrier to access. Naturally, one will be able to wade only over
very short stretches, and will thus be restricted to specific tactical
purposes.

 
It follows from all this that:

1. The attacker is confined to a relatively small number of access routes,

which run along rather narrow dikes; since, in addition, these are
usually flanked by ditches, they amount to endlessly long and
dangerous defiles.

2. Every defensive measure taken on dikes of that sort can very easily be

reinforced to the point where they become impregnable.

3. Because of his limitations, the defender—even at each individual point

—must restrict himself to mere passive resistance: it is his only
chance.

4. This is not a matter of one long line of defense, enclosing the country

like a single barrier. All flanks are equally covered by the difficulty of
access, and new posts can always be set up so that any breach in the
original line can be sealed off. One might almost say, that, as on a
chessboard, the range of combinations is inexhaustible.

5. This entire condition is possible only in a densely cultivated and

populated country. It follows automatically that the number of
crossings and, consequently, of posts to close them, must be very large
in comparison with other strategic dispositions; and from this it
follows further that that type of defensive line should not be a long
one.

 
The principal defensive line in Holland runs from Naarden on the Zuider

Zee (mostly behind the Vecht) to Gorkum on the Waal-on the Biesbosch, to
be accurate—for a length of about forty miles. In 1672 and 1787, a force of
25,000 to 30,000 men was used to defend it. If really insurmountable
resistance could be expected, its value would certainly be very great—at
least to the province of Holland in its rear. The line held fast in 1672 against
a far greater force under eminent generals—first Condé, and then
Luxembourg. They could well have attacked with 40,000 to 50,000 men;

yet they preferred not to use force but to wait for the winter—which, as it
happened, was not severe enough. In 1787, on the other hand, resistance in
the first line was nonexistent; and although on a much shorter line, between
the Zuider Zee and the Haarlemer Meer, it was somewhat more serious, the
Duke of Brunswick broke it in a single day by means of carefully planned
tactical dispositions that exactly suited the local conditions; this in spite of
the fact that the Prussian force that actually advanced against the line was
little stronger, if at all, than the defense.

the difference in the supreme command. In 1672, when Louis XIV
surprised the Dutch, they were on a peacetime footing. In the army, as is
well known, military spirit was not high. The majority of fortresses were
short of ammunition and equipment; they were held by weak garrisons of
mercenary troops, and commanded either by foreigners devoid of loyalty, or
nationals without ability. Therefore, the fortresses on the Rhine, belonging
to Brandenburg but occupied by the Dutch, as well as their own eastern
defensive line, except for Groningen, quickly fell to the French and, for the
most part, without real resistance. The capture of these numerous fortresses
constituted the chief activity of the French army of 150,000 men.

Prince of Orange came to power and brought the national defense under
unified command. He had just time to seal the defensive line described
above, and arrangements were so well coordinated from then on that neither
Condé nor Luxembourg (who commanded the forces remaining in Holland
after Louis XIV and Turenne had left) dared attack a single post.

In 1787, conditions were quite different. It was not the Republic of the

Seven United Provinces that faced the French: the Province of Holland
alone opposed the aggressor, and was to put up the chief resistance. It was
not a matter of capturing fortresses, which had made up the main activity in
1672; the defense fell back at once on the line described above. For their
part, the invaders were only 25,000 strong instead of 150,000; they were not
led by the mighty sovereign of a great neighboring power but only by a
general, subordinate to a distant prince who himself was bound by various
restraints. The people, it is true, were split into two parties everywhere,
even in Holland; but the Dutch republicans were in the majority, and in a
state of genuine enthusiasm. Under these conditions, resistance should have

achieved at least as much in 1787 as in 1672. But there was a fatal
difference: there was no unified command. In 1672 William of Orange had
been entrusted with the command, and executed it with competence,
intelligence and energy. In 1787 reliance was placed on a so-called Defense
Commission, which, though consisting of four energetic men, was quite
unable to bring about unified direction or to inspire confidence. Hence, the
whole apparatus proved deficient in use and unreliable in action.

same time, we wanted to demonstrate how much difference unity and
consistency in the leadership can make.

Although the organization and operation of such defensive lines is a

question of tactics, the defensive line itself is rather more closely related to
strategy, and we should like to make one observation about it, arising from
the 1787 campaign. We believe that, passive as the defense of individual
posts must inevitably be, a counterattack from some part of the line would
be not impossible, and hold out good prospect of success if as in 1787 the
enemy is not numerically stronger. Such an attack could only be made along
the dikes and could hardly have much freedom of movement or impetus;
still, the invader cannot occupy all the dikes and tracks on which he is not
advancing. Thus the defender, who occupies the fortresses and knows the
country, should be able to launch serious flank attacks against the enemy or
cut off his supplies. If we consider the constricted circumstances in which
the advance operates, and particularly its unusual dependence on lines of
communication, we can understand that any counterattack with even a
remote prospect of success must be highly effective even as a
demonstration. We greatly doubt whether so cautious a man as the Duke of
Brunswick would have dared to advance on Amsterdam if the Dutch had
made a single demonstration of that sort, for example from Utrecht.

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

kept in rear or strenuously avoided. It is in the interest of the defender, even
more than of the attacker, to command an unimpeded view, partly because
he is normally the weaker of the two, and partly because the natural
advantages of his position lead him to develop his plans later than the
attacker. If he were to fight with a forest in front of him, he would become
like a blind man fighting a man who can see. If he took up position in the
middle of the forest, both of course would be equally blind; but this equality
would be detrimental to his interests.

A forest of that sort, therefore, cannot bear any useful relationship to the

defense unless it is kept in the defender’s rear. Then it can be used as a
screen for whatever movements are in train, and to cover and facilitate his
eventual retreat.

These remarks apply, of course, only to forests in the plains. Wherever

the terrain is mountainous it will predominate in tactical and strategic
arrangements. This has already been discussed elsewhere.

Impenetrable forests, on the other hand—or rather, forests where one

must keep to the roads traversing them—do present opportunities for
indirect defense similar to those offered by mountains: one can initiate a
battle when conditions are favorable. The army, in a more or less
concentrated position, can wait behind the forest for the enemy to appear
and attack him as he emerges from the narrow road. In its effects, such a
forest is more like mountains than like a river: it is very slow and difficult
to traverse, but, as far as a retreat is concerned, it is rather an asset than a
danger.

risky matter, even for the lightest chain of outposts. Abattis are
psychological obstacles only, and no forest is so impassable that small units
cannot infiltrate it in hundreds of places. In a defensive chain, these are like
the first few drops of water leaking through a dam: a general breakthrough
is sure to follow.

important in the case of a national insurrection, for which they are
unquestionably the right environment. If a strategic plan of defense can be
contrived that makes the enemy’s lines of communication run through deep
forests, a powerful lever has been added to the machinery of defense.

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

A defensive line, long enough to cover an extensive area directly, will

obviously be able to render only minimal resistance. This would be true
even if large numbers were deployed, provided they were opposed by
equally numerous forces. The intent of a cordon, then, is to withstand a
slight attack—slight either because the attacker is easily discouraged or
because the attacking force is small.

This was the function of the Great Wall of China: a protection against

Tartar raids. It is also the significance of all the lines and frontier defenses
of the European States bordering on Asia and Turkey. In this sense, cordons
are neither absurd nor ill-adapted to their purpose. Admittedly, they will not
be able to prevent every raid; but all incursions are made more difficult, and
they therefore occur less frequently—which is an important consideration in
the relations prevailing with Asiatic peoples, where a state of war is
virtually permanent.

The lines that were erected in the recent wars between European states—

for instance the French lines on the Rhine and in the Netherlands—come
close to being cordons in that sense. Basically, they are meant to protect the
country from inroads intended merely to levy contributions or live off the
enemy. Since they are meant to deal only with minor incursions, they will
only have minor forces at their command. Of course, wherever the enemy’s
main force is directed against these lines, they will have to be held by the
defender’s main force as well—and that is far from being the best way of

organizing a defense. Because of this drawback, and because the protection
against raids is of extremely limited importance in a short war in which the
existence of such lines may entail an overexpenditure of forces, lines of that
sort are nowadays regarded as a disadvantageous arrangement. The greater
the fury with which the war is waged, the more dangerous and futile they
become.

Finally, an extended line of outposts designed to cover an army’s

billeting area and to offer a certain degree of resistance, should also be
considered as a true cordon.

Resistance of that type is mainly meant to cope with raids and other

minor operations aimed at making billets unsafe, and if the terrain is right, it
can serve the purpose well enough. Against the main force of the enemy, on
the other hand, resistance can be only relative—concerned, in other words,
with gaining time: but any time that is gained will usually not be
significant. It will, therefore, seldom be considered the purpose of a cordon.
The enemy force can never assemble and advance so secretly that the
defender’s first news of it would come from his outposts. If that were to
happen, one could only feel very sorry for him.

the other two instances there is nothing contradictory about it.

But for the main force, intended to defend the country, to be strung out in

a long series of defensive posts against the enemy’s main army—in fact, in
a cordon—would be so absurd that one would have to investigate the
immediate 
circumstances 
accompanying 
and 
explaining 
such 
an

occurrence.

fighting a battle with the fullest possible strength, is bound to be more
extended than it would be in the plains. This is possible because the terrain
enormously enhances the defensive potential; it is required because a wider
base is needed for retreat, as we have seen in the chapter on defensive
mountain warfare. However if no battle is imminent, the enemy is likely to
be facing us for a considerable time without making any move unless a
favorable opportunity arises—which has been the normal condition in most
wars. In such a situation, one will naturally not want to be confined to the
occupation of a minimum area: one will want to be in control of as much of
the country on all sides as the safety of one’s army permits. This gives rise

to a number of benefits to be discussed in detail later on. In open,
unobstructed country, it is made easier than in the mountains by the element
of mobility; consequently, there will be less need for the extension and
splintering of forces to accomplish this purpose. It would also be much
more dangerous because each individual unit would have a reduced
capacity to resist.

defense; it is harder to reach a threatened point; and if the enemy gets there
first, he is not easily dislodged even by a slightly superior force. Such
conditions will tend to lead to arrangements which, while not exactly a
cordon, do consist of a series of defensive posts very much like one. From
such a disposition, consisting of several detached posts, to a cordon is still a
long step; but it is one that is frequently taken by a general without his
realizing it—by being lured from one stage to the next. To begin with, the
object of such dispersion is the security and possession of the country; then
it is the safety of the troops themselves. Each commander will weigh the
advantages of occupying various points of access to either side of his post,
and so the whole force gradually slides imperceptibly from one degree of
dispersal to the next.

as a matter of deliberate choice, designed to stop all enemy attacks, but a
condition into which one is drawn in the pursuit of a completely different
objective—the preservation and security of the country against an enemy
who is not intent on major action. That is always wrong, and the arguments
by which a general lets himself be coaxed into forming one small post after
another are always trivial compared with the importance of keeping his
main force intact. Yet the existence of these arguments shows at least the
possibility of such confusion. The fact that it really is a mistake—a
misjudgment of the enemy and of one’s own position—is apt to go
unnoticed; what is blamed is the faulty method. But the method is tacitly
approved wherever it has been used to advantage, or at least without doing
any harm. Everyone praises the faultless campaigns fought by Prince Henry
in the Seven Years War, because that is what the King called them; actually,
these campaigns include the most extreme and incomprehensible examples
of extended chains of posts, which deserve the name of cordon as much as
any. One can fully justify these positions by saying that the Prince knew his

opponents and was sure that no decisive action was to be expected;
moreover, the object of his disposition was always to control the largest
possible area, and he therefore went as far as circumstances would possibly
allow. Still, if the Prince had once been caught in such a cobweb and had
sustained a heavy loss, one would have had to conclude, not that he had
followed a faulty system of warfare, but rather that he had used the wrong
measure, applying it to a situation to which it was not suited.

So much for our attempt to indicate how a so-called cordon-system can

originate with the main force of a theater of operations and be sensible and
useful enough not to appear absurd. We must add that there seem to have
been occasions when commanders and their general staffs have overlooked
the real significance of a cordon-system, treating its relative value as
absolute, and believing it capable of holding off all enemy attacks whatever.
These were not misapplications of a method, but a total inability to grasp its
nature. We admit that this absurdity, among others, seems to have played a
part in the defense of the Vosges by the Prussian and Austrian armies in
1793 and 1794.

CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE

We shall attempt a clear exposition of the concept and consider what

practical value it retains.

We deal with it at this point, since it is closely bound up with defense of

mountains and rivers, as well as the concept of fortified and entrenched
positions, which we have just discussed.

Behind the hoary martial metaphor of “key to the country” there lurks a

vague, confused idea, sometimes denoting the most widely open region of a
country, and sometimes the region most strongly defended.

advance into enemy territory, it may correctly be designated as the key to
the country. But this simple and frankly not very valuable concept has not
been enough for the theoreticians; they have raised it to a higher power and
used it to denote points that will put you in possession of the whole country.

When the Russians set about invading the Crimean peninsula, they had to

start by capturing the Isthmus of Perekop and its defensive lines—not
because there was no other way of entering (Lacy, in fact, had turned the
lines in 1737 and again in 1738) but in order to be tolerably safe once they
had established themselves in the Crimea. That is plain enough, though the
concept of a key-point hardly adds to our understanding. However, if one
were able to say that whoever occupies the area around Langres owns or is
in command of all of France as far as Paris—in other words, once Langres
is occupied it depends only on him whether or not to take possession of the

country—it would obviously be a very different and much more important
claim. According to the first view, possession of a country is considered
impossible without the point designated as the key. That stands to reason.
According to the second view, however, possession of the country is the
inevitable consequence of possession of the point designated as the key.
That is obviously mysterious, beyond the bounds of normal understanding,
requiring the magic power of the occult sciences. This incantation actually
began to appear in print about fifty years ago and reached its zenith at the
end of the eighteenth century. Despite the overwhelming force, assurance
and logic with which Bonaparte’s leadership swept away previous military
conceptions, that magic formula contrived to keep a tenuous hold on life
and continued to spin its fragile thread in the literature.

country there are some points of exceptional importance, where a number
of roads converge, where it is easy to stockpile supplies, whence one can
conveniently move in several directions; in short, whose possession
satisfies a number of needs and offers a number of advantages. If generals
wanting to describe the importance of such a point in a single word wish to
call it a key to the country, it would be pedantic to object; on the contrary,
the expression is apt and agreeable. But if this little flower of speech is
blown up to form the core of a whole system, branching out in various
directions like a tree, sheer common sense should warn you to restrain
yourself and keep to the proper value of the term.

of a key to the country in a practical but, on the other hand, very imprecise
sense. In order to develop it into a system, one had to transform it into a
more specific and consequently more limited term. From all available
aspects, that of high ground was chosen.

When a road traverses a mountain ridge, the traveler breathes a sigh of

relief once he has reached the summit and the descent begins. This holds
true of an individual, and even more so of an army. All difficulties seem to
be, and usually have been, overcome. We feel that the descent will be easy,
and we shall be able to conquer any obstacle in our path. The country is
spread out before us and appears to be at our feet, metaphorically as well as
physically. Thus, the highest point of a road across the mountains has
usually been considered the decisive one. In the majority of cases, this is

what it actually is—though by no means in all. These are the points that are
often designated as key points in generals’ memoirs—usually, to be sure, in
a slightly different sense, and mostly with limited application. This is the
concept that has frequently been used as a starting point for the erroneous
theory (of which Lloyd may have been the founder); that is why the
elevated points from which several roads descend into the country to be
conquered have been considered as the keys to that country—in fact as
points that dominate the country. It followed as a matter of course that this
concept merged with a closely related one, that of the systematic defense of
mountain country; the effect was to drive the matter still further into the
realm of fantasy. A mass of tactical elements relevant to mountain warfare
became involved, and as a result the concept of the highest point on a road
being the key to the country was replaced by the highest point in the
mountain range—in other words, the watershed.

At that very time, however, at the end of the eighteenth century, new

theories began to be disseminated concerning the formation of the earth’s
surface by the process of erosion. Natural science, in the form of this
geological system, became the ally of military history. This broke the dam
of practical common sense; sensible discussion was swept away in a flood
of illusions based on geological analogy. Hence in the late eighteenth
century one heard—or rather, read—about nothing but the sources of the
Danube and the Rhine. We admit that this nonsense abounded primarily in
the literature, and that only a fraction of book-learning will seep into
practical life anyhow; and the more foolish the theory, the less of it. Yet this
particular theory had some practical effect, at Germany’s expense. In order
to prove that we are not tilting at windmills, let us cite two actual examples:
first, the important but highly doctrinaire campaigns of the Prussian army in
the Vosges in 1793 and 1794 (to which the works of Massenbach and
Grawert provide the theoretical key); and second, the campaign of 1814
when, in obedience to the theory, an army of 200,000 men was forced to
make a senseless march through Switzerland to get to Langres.

just that. All that was written at the turn of the century about its influence
on military affairs was an exaggeration and a faulty application of basically
sound ideas, and was completely unrealistic. If the Rhine, the Danube, and
all six rivers of Germany agreed to honor a single mountain with a common

point of origin, its military value would still not be increased thereby,
except possibly as a place for a trigonometrical marker. It would have little
value for a signal tower, still less for an observation post, and none at all for
a whole army.

nodal point of several mountain ranges where the highest river sources are
located—is nothing but an impractical application of the textbook. It is
repudiated by Nature herself: she never makes ridges and valleys as
accessible from above as is postulated by what has hitherto been known as
the theory of terrain, but scatters peaks and gorges at random, and often
puts the lowest lakes among the highest massifs. If we consult military
history, we will find that the salient geological features of an area hardly
affect its military use with any regularity; what little effect they have is
outweighed by other local needs and factors. Military lines will often pass
very close by a feature of that sort without its attracting them specifically.

length only because a whole elegant system has been developed out of it.
Let us return to our own point of view.

autonomous strategic concept, all it can mean is an area which one must
hold before one can risk an advance into enemy territory. If the idea is to be
stretched, on the other hand, to cover any point of easy access to a country,
or any convenient central point therein, the term will start to lose its proper
meaning, and its value will decline accordingly. It would merely denote
something that could be found more or less anywhere, and would become
nothing but a convenient figure of speech.

to the enemy’s country is usually his army, and if terrain is to have
precedence over military force, it must promise some exceptionally
advantageous conditions. If these are present, they can usually be
recognized by two outstanding characteristics: first, that the powers of
resistance of the force deployed in that particular place be notably improved
through the support of the terrain; and second, that the position effectively
threatens the enemy’s lines of communication before one’s own are
threatened by him.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

These flanking operations and the flank positions that go with them are

also among those prize exhibits of the theorists that are seldom found in
actual war. The reason is not that they are ineffective or illusory as devices,
but that both sides normally take precautions against them; the cases in
which such precautions cannot be taken are rare. In these rare cases, of
course, the measure has often been most effective; for this reason, and
because of the constant vigilance it causes in wartime, the theorist must
define the matter with the utmost clarity. While a strategic flanking
operation is possible in attack as well as in defense, it has far greater
affinity with the latter, and therefore must take its place among the methods
of defense.

One simple principle must be laid down before we go into the matter—

one that should never be overlooked in the subsequent discussion: forces
sent to operate against the enemy’s rear and flank are not available for use
against his front. It would therefore be quite mistaken, both in tactics and
strategy, to think that falling on the enemy’s rear is an accomplishment in
itself. It has no value in isolation, but will become effective only in
conjunction with other factors. Moreover, depending on these other factors,
its value may be positive or negative. These now require examination.

First of all, we must distinguish between two aspects of the effect of a

strategic flanking operation: the effect on the enemy’s line 
of

communication only, and the effect on his line of retreat—which may in
turn have repercussions on communications.

destined for the siege of Olmütz, he was obviously not interested in
blocking the King’s retreat into Silesia: on the contrary, he hoped to bring it
about, and was ready to facilitate it.

by the main Russian army in September and October was to interrupt
communications—not to block the French retreat. But the latter was
obviously the intention of the Army of the Moldau, which advanced toward
the Beresina under Chichagov; it was also the purpose of the attack that
General Wittgenstein was ordered to make on the French corps at the
Dwina.

These examples are given simply to clarify the point.
Pressure on lines of communication is aimed at enemy convoys, small

detachments in the army’s wake, couriers, travelers, minor enemy depots,
and so forth—at anything, in fact, that the enemy needs to keep his army in
a healthy, vigorous condition. In this manner, pressure is meant to weaken
the condition of the enemy forces, and thereby bring about their retreat.

but it can only do so if a retreat has really been his intention. However, the
mere threat may bring about the withdrawal, and thus, by acting as a
demonstration, it may have the same effect as pressure on lines of
communication. Still, as we have said, none of these effects can be expected
to result from the mere act of turning the enemy’s position or from the mere
geometrical form of disposition; they can only obtain under the appropriate
conditions.

In order to make these conditions easier to understand, we shall keep the

two kinds of flanking operations separate, and start by examining those
directed at lines of communication.

other of which must be present.

The first is that effective action against the enemy’s flank can be taken by

small detachments of troops that are so insignificant in number that they
will hardly be missed at the front.

he is therefore unable to exploit a new victory over our forces, or to pursue
us if we were to withdraw.

The latter case is not so rare as might appear; but for the moment we

shall disregard it and deal with the additional conditions of the former.

The more important of these preconditions is that the enemy’s lines of

communication be fairly long—too long to be covered by a small number
of good posts; and the other, that their location would expose them to action
on our part.

where it is not perpendicular to the enemy’s front; and the fact that the lines
of communication may run through enemy territory. If both factors are at
work, the lines will be all the more exposed. Each factor calls for closer
study.

When there are two or three hundred miles of communications to be

covered, one would hardly think it mattered much whether the army at the
far end of the line was deployed at right angles to it or not: the total extent
of its position is a mere dot compared to the length of the line. But in fact it
matters a good deal. If one army is drawn up at right angles to its line of
communication, even a numerically superior enemy will find it hard to
disrupt the line by means of raiding parties. If one only considers the
problem of giving absolute protection to a certain area, this is hard to
believe; on the contrary, it would seem that an army would be hard-driven
to protect its rear—that is the area behind it—from all the raids a stronger
enemy could mount. True enough, if only war were as predictable in
practice as it is on paper! In that event, the side which had to cover its lines
of communication would be in a constant state of uncertainty as to where to
expect the raiding parties—it would be practically blind in comparison with
the raiders. But consider the unreliable and fragmentary nature of all
intelligence in war. Remember that both sides fumble in the dark at all
times. One will quickly realize that a party sent past the enemy’s wing to
raid his rear is like a man in a dark room with a gang of enemies. They will
get him in the end. A similar fate awaits the raiders. Once they have turned
the enemy’s perpendicular position, he is close upon them, but their friends
are far away. Not only is there a risk of considerable losses, but the
machinery itself is in danger of breaking down: as soon as one of the parties

experiences any trouble, the rest will all lose heart. Instead of a bold attack
and a daring provocation, one will witness only constant attempts to escape.

the nearest points of its lines of communication for a distance of two to
three marches, depending on the size of the army. These nearest points are,
however, the ones in most immediate danger, because they are also closest
to the enemy.

On the other hand, in case of a decidedly oblique position, no part of the

lines of communication can be covered in this way. The slightest presssure,
the most faint-hearted attempt on the part of the enemy, constitutes a direct
threat to some vulnerable point.

What is it that determines the front of a position if it is not the right angle

it makes with its line of communication? It is the enemy’s front, of course
—although this in turn could be considered as being conditioned by our
own. Here an interaction is at work for which we must find the causes.

make a wide angle with the defender’s (C-D). If the defender wanted to take
up a position at E, where the two lines meet, it is evident that the attacker
could, from position B, compel the defender, by means of the geometrical
relation alone, to face him with his front, and consequently expose his line
of communication.

The opposite would be the case if the defender took up his position

somewhere short of the junction point, say at D. In that event, the attacker’s
front would have to face him—provided the attacker’s line of operations,
which is mainly dependent on topography, could not be altered at will and
made to run, for example, from A to D. From this one might deduce that the
play of interaction benefits the defender, for he need only take up position

somewhere short of the junction point. We do not attach much importance
to this geometrical argument, and have only brought it in to make the matter
absolutely clear. Actually, we are convinced that the position taken by the
defender will be strongly influenced by local and other specific
considerations. Consequently, one cannot lay down a general rule to show
which of the two lines of communication is more likely to be exposed.

If both lines of communication run in exactly the same direction, the side

that places its position at an angle to that line will, of course, force the
enemy to do the same. But in that case there is no geometric gain.
Advantages and disadvantages will be equal for both sides.

side’s line of communication is exposed.

runs through hostile territory—the extent of its vulnerability where the
population is in arms is obvious: one must treat the situation as if enemy
forces were stationed all along the line. They may be small in numbers,
lacking in depth and in capacity to follow through; but think what constant
interference with the line at so many points along its length can mean!
There is no need to elaborate. But even if the enemy population is not in
arms, and there is no militia or any other form of military support in the
area—even, indeed, if the population has no stomach at all for war—its
mere allegiance to the enemy remains a palpable disadvantage to the other
side’s lines of communication. The assistance available to a raiding party
that speaks the local tongue, knows the country and the people, is able to
receive messages, and enjoys the support of the local authorities, can make
all the difference to a small detachment, and it is easily obtainable.
Furthermore, there are bound to be fortresses, rivers, mountains, and other
points of refuge within reasonable range which are still in enemy hands,
unless one has taken formal possession and stationed garrisons there.

action against the enemy’s lines of communication is possible even if they
join his front at a right angle; our raiders do not constantly have to fall back
on their own forces, but can find plenty of shelter by simply vanishing into
the countryside.

This gives us the following:

1. Considerable length
2. An oblique direction and
3. Hostile territory

as the main conditions that expose an army’s lines of communication to
being severed by relatively small forces. To make this disruption effective,
a fourth condition is required—a certain length of time. On that subject, we
would ask the reader to refer to our remarks in the fifteenth chapter of Book
Five.

But these four conditions are only the outstanding factors that affect the

matter: linked to them are numerous local and individual circumstances,
often more significant and of wider implication than our four conditions. To
mention only the most important, let us list the state of the roads, the nature
of the country which they traverse, the cover afforded by rivers, mountains
and morasses, the season and the weather, the importance of particular
convoys (such as siege-trains), the number of light troops, and so forth.

All these factors, then, will determine the success with which a general

can operate against his opponent’s lines of communication. Taking the sum
of all these parts on both sides and weighing each against the other, one can
strike a balance between the two systems of communication. This balance
will determine which general can outdo the other in that respect.

While our exposition of the matter may seem rather lengthy, in practice a

decision can often be made at first glance. But this calls for seasoned
judgment; reflection on all the cases reviewed here will provide the answer
to the usual absurd arguments by critics who think they can settle the matter
without closer examination merely by mentioning “turning the flank” and
“flanking operations.”

We have now to deal with the second main condition for strategic

flanking operations.

If the enemy is blocked from making further progress by something other

than our own defense—no matter what it may be—we need no longer be
afraid of weakening our forces by sending out strong detachments. Even if
the enemy hopes to make us pay by launching an attack, we can simply
yield some ground and decline the battle. This is what the main Russian
army did before Moscow. But the enormous dimensions and conditions
obtaining in that campaign are not essential. During the First Silesian Wars,

Frederick the Great found himself constantly in this situation on the
frontiers of Bohemia and Moravia. One can postulate a wide variety of
reasons, particularly political ones, in the complicated relations of generals
and their armies, that would make all further progress impossible.

therefore other conditions need not be so favorable. Even the relation
between the enemy’s system of communication and our own need not be in
our favor: the enemy cannot make much use of our withdrawal, nor can he
easily retaliate. He will be more concerned with directly covering his own
retreat.

without a battle, which might be considered too risky: it makes use of a
means that is less brilliant and far-reaching, but at the same time less risky
than an outright victory.

In such a case, it is not as risky to take up a position on one of the flanks,

even if it exposes one’s own line of communication. It will always cause the
enemy to form front obliquely to his own communications—whereby this
particular condition from among those listed above will be met almost
every time. The likelihood of success will increase in proportion to the
influence exerted by the other factors, together with other favorable
circumstances; to the degree that these are not available, everything will
depend on superior skill in planning and on rapid, accurate execution.

seen in Silesia and Saxony in the Seven Years War, in 1760 and 1762. The
fact that these maneuvers were so common in many wars fought with only
moderate intensity should not always be taken as evidence that a general
has reached the end of his tether. It may just as well mean that lack of
resolution, courage and enterprise, and unwillingness to take responsibility
have taken the place of real impediments. We need only cite the case of
Field-Marshal Daun.

To sum up the results of this discussion, we would say that flanking

operations are most useful:

1. In defense
2. Toward the end of a campaign
3. Especially during a retreat into the interior of the country and

4. In conjunction with armed insurrection.
 
Concerning the execution of these operations against lines of

communication, a few words will suffice.

Their conduct must be in the hands of skillful raiders who must move

daringly in small detachments and attack boldly, assaulting the enemy’s
weaker garrisons, convoys and minor units on the march. They must
encourage the local home guards and occasionally join them in operations.
The numbers of these units matters more than their individual strength, and
they should be so organized that several can link up for a major operation
without being too much hampered by the vanity and caprice of individual
leaders.

Finally, we must consider the effect on the enemy’s line of retreat.
Here one should particularly bear in mind the principle stated at the start,

namely, that troops used in the enemy’s rear cannot be used against his
front; that is to say, that the effect of an action on the rear or flanks will not
in itself multiply our forces. Rather it will raise their potential to a higher
power—higher as to possible success, but also higher as to possible danger.

All armed resistance, other than the direct and simple kind, tends to raise

the stake and raise the risk as well. That rule applies to flanking operations,
whether carried out by the whole united force, or with divided forces
attacking and enveloping on several sides.

For cutting off the enemy’s retreat—if the move is meant seriously and

not just as a demonstration—the best solution is a decisive battle, or at least
its pre-conditions. In this solution the two elements of higher stakes and
higher risks will be re-united. Only favorable conditions, therefore, can
justify a commander adopting this method.

In this method one must distinguish between the two forms we have

mentioned. The first arises when a general decides to use his full force to
attack the enemy in the rear, either from a flank position taken with that end
in mind, or by means of a full-scale turning movement. The second arises if
he divides his force, assumes an enveloping position, and threatens the
enemy rear with one part and his front with the other.

The effect is equally intensified either way: the retreat may be cut

absolutely, in which case a large part of the enemy force will be captured or

The risk, however, is different in each case.
If one uses one’s whole force to turn the enemy, one risks leaving one’s

rear exposed. Once again, all depends on the relationship between the two
lines of retreat, just as, in the parallel case of the effect on the lines of
communication, the deciding factor was their relation to each other.

than the attacker in terms of lines of communication and retreat, and to that
extent he is better placed for a strategic turning movement. But this general
relationship is not cogent enough to base an effective system on it. Again
individual cases can only be decided in the light of all the circumstances.

easier to find in large areas than in restricted ones; they also arise more
often in truly independent states than in weaker ones that depend on foreign
help and whose armies, therefore, must above all secure the point of
juncture with their allies. Finally, conditions favor the defender most toward
the end of a campaign when the attack has spent its force—again in much
the same way as in the case of lines of communication.

the Moscow-Kaluga road in 1812, when Bonaparte’s assault was
slackening, would have been a serious error in the Drissa camp at the start
of the campaign, had not the Russians had the wit to change their plan in
time.

division of forces. The danger here lies in that division itself, for the enemy
has the benefit of the concentration of his internal lines and can thus bring
superior numbers against any individual part of his opponent’s force. This
hazard cannot be eliminated, and only three main causes justify one’s
exposure to it:

1. A previous division of forces, which makes this type of operation

obligatory if one wishes to avoid a major loss of time

2. Great physical and moral superiority, which will justify taking drastic

measures

course.

 
Frederick the Great did not intend to combine his frontal attack with

another on the enemy’s strategic rear when he invaded Bohemia by
convergent routes in 1757; at least, that was not his main concern (as we
shall show elsewhere in greater detail). It is clear, at all events, that there
could be no question of concentrating his forces in Silesia or Saxony before
beginning the invasion, since that would have cost him all the benefits of
surprise.

When the allies were planning the fall campaign of 1813, their great

material superiority entitled them to plan to use the bulk of their strength in
an attack on Bonaparte’s right flank, which rested on the River Elbe, in
order to shift the theater of operations from the Oder to the Elbe. Their
reverse at Dresden was not caused by this general plan, but by specific
strategic and tactical measures that were taken. After all, the strength with
which they confronted Bonaparte at Dresden was 220,000 to 130,000—a
ratio that presumably left little to be desired. Anyway, the ratio was not
much more favorable at Leipzig: 285,000 to 157,000. It is true that
Bonaparte’s army was too evenly deployed to operate effectively along a
single defensive line, for he had 70,000 men against 90,000 in Silesia, and
70,000 in the Mark of Brandenburg against 110,000; but in any case it
would have been difficult for him—short of abandoning Silesia completely
—to collect an army on the Elbe that could have dealt the main force of the
allies a decisive blow. Likewise, the allies could easily have sent Wrede’s
army to the River Main with orders to attempt to cut off Bonaparte’s road to
Mainz.

In 1812 the Russians were able to direct the Army of the Moldau toward

Volhynia and Lithuania so as to use it later in the rear of the main French
army; since it was absolutely safe to assume that Moscow was to be the
culminating point of the French offensive. In that campaign there was no
danger to Russia beyond Moscow, and the Russians therefore did not have
to worry about their main force being too weak for this operation.

The original plan of defense, worked out by General Phull, had been

based on the same disposition of forces: Barclay’s army was to occupy the
Drissa camp while Bagration’s advanced against the rear of the enemy’s

main force. But what a difference there was between these two instances! In
the first, the French were three times as strong as the Russians; in the
second, the Russians were distinctly stronger than the French. In the first,
Bonaparte’s army had an impetus that took it all the way to Moscow, 400
miles beyond Drissa; in the second, it was unable to make another day’s
march from Moscow. In the first, the line of retreat to the Niemen would
not have been more than 150 miles; it was 500 in the second. The same
operations, then, that eventually were so effective against the French retreat
would have been the wildest folly in the beginning.

Action against an enemy’s line of retreat (if it is to amount to more than a

demonstration) constitutes an actual attack upon his rear. A good deal more
could be said on this subject, but the book on the attack is a more suitable
place for that. We shall, therefore, leave it for now, and content ourselves
with having shown the conditions under which a counteraction of this sort
can be carried out.

When this subject is discussed it is generally more in terms of the

demonstration than of the actual attack—the intention being to cause the
enemy to retreat. If to be effective each demonstration had to signify that an
actual attack was completely feasible—which, at first glance, seems
obvious—the two would converge in every detail. But that is not the case:
we refer the reader to the chapter on demonstrations, which will show that
somewhat different conditions are involved.107

that conclusion; which we can afford to do since military history has shown
it to be true in every campaign in which great distances were covered.

while by means of a steady, calculated resistance he makes the attacker pay
in blood for every foot of progress. The advance becomes a steady push
forward rather than a mere pursuit.

more serious after a defeat than in a voluntary withdrawal. Even assuming
that he can resist the invader day after day, as he could if he withdrew
voluntarily, his losses will be at least as heavy, and the casualties in battle
would have to be added. But such an assumption flies in the face of
probability. The best army in the world that is forced to retire to the interior
of the country after a defeat in battle will sustain disproportionate losses;
and if the enemy is considerably stronger—as one can assume in the cases
under study—if he presses on with vigor, as has normally been done in
recent wars, the outcome will most likely be an actual rout, and will ruin the
defending army.

A calculated day-by-day resistance means one in which resistance is

maintained only so long as the issue can be kept in doubt. It calls for
avoiding defeat by yielding the contested ground in time. That sort of

fighting will cost the attacker at least as many lives as the defender: the
latter’s unavoidable losses in men captured will be equaled by the attacker’s
losses in combat, since he has always to struggle against the defender’s
advantages of terrain. True, the retreating army loses its severely wounded
altogether, but the attacker also loses his, since they usually have to remain
in hospital for several months.

more or less equally.

pursued. Resistance becomes difficult, indeed sometimes impossible, as a
consequence of battle casualties, loss of order and of courage, and anxiety
about the retreat. The pursuer who, in the former case, had to move with
circumspection, almost groping like a blind man, can now advance with the
assurance of the victor, the arrogance of the fortunate, and the confidence of
the demigod. The faster his pace, the greater the speed with which events
will run along their predetermined course: this is the primary area where
psychological forces will increase and multiply without being rigidly bound
to the weights and measures of the material world.

differ according to the manner in which they have reached the point that
may be regarded as the terminus of the offensive.

add the debilitation suffered by the attacker in other ways, which we have
already said will be treated in Book Seven. The defender, on the other hand,
will almost always gather additional strength from reinforcements, whether
contributed by outside forces or by his own persistent efforts.

need.

points; the pursuing army is dependent on having its supplies forwarded—a
difficult task while it is on the move, no matter how short its lines of
communication. It is bound to have shortages from the start.

trampled fields, empty wells, and muddied streams.

shortages from the outset. He can never count on finding enemy supplies: if
indeed he were to capture some from time to time it would be a matter of
pure luck, or of gross neglect on the defender’s part.

and the strength of the belligerents not too unequal, a relative state of forces
will result that offers the defender far greater prospects of success than a
decisive battle on the frontier. But it is not the mere prospect of a victory
that is increased through the change in relative strengths; the altered
situation will increase the impact of that victory as well. There is an
enormous difference between losing a battle on one’s own frontier and
losing it in the very heart of enemy territory! Indeed, the condition of the
invader at the end of his course is often such that even a victory can force
him to retreat; he may not have enough reserves to follow up his success
and make the most of it, nor can he hope to replace his losses.

two drawbacks. The first consists of the losses the country suffers as a
consequence of the enemy invasion; the second is the moral impact.

for which no temporary sacrifice should be considered too severe. Still,
while the wastage of the land may not be decisive, it must figure on the
balance sheet, because it always affects our interests.

involves will not damage the army directly, but rather in a roundabout way.
It is difficult to balance the advantages against the disadvantages; they are
different in kind, and their effects have no common meeting point. All that
can be said is that the loss is increased if a fertile, densely populated area
with great commercial cities has to be given up, but that it is greatest if it
includes the loss of war material, whether in finished form or in process of
production.

must rise above it, calmly hold to his plans and face the short-term
objections that are advanced by fainter hearts. Still, this impression is no

mere specter that can easily be dismissed; it is not like a force that affects
only a single point, but rather one that spreads instantaneously through
every sinew, and paralyzes all military and civil activity. There may be
times when the army and the nation fully understand the reasons for
withdrawing to the interior, when confidence and hope may even be
fortified as a result; but they are very rare. As a rule, the people and the
army cannot even tell the difference between a planned retreat and a
backward stumble; still less can they be certain if a plan is a wise one,
based on anticipation of positive advantages, or whether it has simply been
dictated by fear of the enemy. There will be public concern and resentment
at the fate of the abandoned areas; the army will possibly lose confidence
not only in its leaders but in itself, and never-ending rear guard actions will
only tend to confirm its fears. These consequences of retreat should not be
underrated. Moreover, in the abstract it is, of course, more natural, simpler,
nobler, and more in keeping with a nation’s moral character to face the
challenge squarely, and ensure that an enemy who violates a frontier will be
made to pay a penalty in blood.

about the conditions and circumstances that will favor it.

retreat; just a few days’ advance will obviously not weaken the enemy
perceptibly. In 1812 Bonaparte’s center numbered 250,000 men at Vitebsk;
it was down to 182,000 at Smolensk, and not until Borodino had it been
reduced to 120,000 men—that is, become equal to the Russian center.
Borodino is 450 miles from the frontier, but not until Moscow did the
Russians possess a decisive superiority. Once it was established, however,
the reversal was so inevitable that even the French success at
Maloyaroslavetz had no substantial effect.

miles long is conceivable in very few. On the other hand, the conditions that
produced an army like that of the French in 1812 are unlikely to recur—to
say nothing of the disproportion that obtained between the two antagonists
at the outset, when the French had more than twice the amount of men, with
immense prestige into the bargain. Therefore, what was accomplished here
in the space of 500 miles, may in other cases be accomplished in 250 or
even 150.

Among the favorable circumstances are:

1. A sparsely cultivated area
2. A loyal and warlike people
3. Severe weather conditions.
 
All these make it hard to keep an army in the field. They involve massive

convoys, numerous detachments, and heavy fatigue. They lead to sickness,
and make flanking operations easier for the defender.

The final factor affecting this method of defense is the actual numbers of

the fighting forces involved.

It is of course in the nature of things that, apart from the relative strength

of the two armies, a smaller force will be exhausted sooner than a larger
one; it cannot run so long a course, and therefore the radius of its theater of
operations is bound to be restricted. In fact, a fairly constant ratio exists
between the size of a force and the area it can occupy. This ratio cannot be
expressed in numbers; besides, it is subject to change by other
circumstances. Here it is enough to say that the relationship between the
two is permanent and fundamental. One may be able to march on Moscow
with 500,000 men, but never with 50,000—even if the invader’s strength
relative to the defender’s were greater in the second case than in the first.

Let us assume, therefore, that the absolute size of the force in relation to

the area is constant in two different cases: there is no doubt that the effect of
our retreat will increase the debilitation of the enemy in proportion to the
numbers involved.

1. The invader will find it more difficult to supply and billet his troops.

Even if the areas covered expand in proportion to the armies, they can never
be the sole source of supplies, and everything sent forward from the base
will suffer a higher rate of wastage. Moreover only a small part of the area,
and never the whole, will be used for billeting; and the area used will not
increase in proportion to the numbers of the troops.

2. Progress will be slower as troops increase in number. Therefore it will

take more time for the advance to run its course, and the aggregate of daily
losses will be that much greater.

Three thousand men on the heels of two thousand will generally not

allow them to retreat by easy marches of five, ten, or even fifteen miles at a

time, or come to a halt for a few days every now and then. Only a few hours
are needed to catch up, attack, and disperse the enemy. But if we multiply
these figures by a hundred, we have another problem altogether. It is no
longer a matter of a few hours, but of a day, or even two. Neither side can
remain assembled in one place; all plans and movements become intricate,
and consequently everything requires more time. The attacker is faced with
the additional handicap that problems of supply make him spread out much
more than the defender, and in consequence he always runs the risk of being
overwhelmed by a superior force at some point—which is what the
Russians attempted at Vitebsk.

day-to-day needs of strategy and tactics. Imagine 100,000 men marching to
the assembly point and back, day after day, stopping and starting, now
taking up arms, now cooking meals or distributing rations, all being kept in
the field until the necessary reports have been received. For all these minor
efforts, which are only incidental to the march itself, those 100,000 men
will as a rule need twice the time that 50,000 would—but the day only has
twenty-four hours for each. As for the march itself, we have pointed out in
Chapter Ten of the preceding book how much the time and energy
consumed will vary with the number of troops involved.

All these problems also of course affect the retreating army, but they bear

more heavily on the invader because:

1. He has more men (we assumed the attacker’s superiority from the

beginning);

2. By yielding ground the defender acquires the right to guide the

operation and compel the other side to adjust to his actions. He is able
to plan ahead and can usually hold to his intentions. The invader,
however, can make his dispositions only after his opponent has taken
up positions, which have always first to be reconnoitered.

We must recall that we are discussing the pursuit of an enemy who

has not suffered a defeat, who has not even lost a battle; we are not
contradicting what was said in Chapter Twelve of Book Four.

The advantage of compelling the attacker to adjust his movements

to ours makes a difference in terms of saving time and effort, and in

many other minor ways. In the long run this can be of great
importance;

bridges are repaired, the most convenient sites are chosen for camps,
and so forth. On the other hand, it is trying just as hard to make the
pursuit more difficult for the enemy by destroying bridges, making bad
roads worse merely by using them, denying the enemy the best
camping places and watering points by occupying them itself, and so
forth.

Finally, we must mention that a popular insurrection is an

exceptionally favorable factor. Since this will be taken up in a separate
chapter, we need not go into details here.

 
Up to now, we have discussed the advantages of this type of retreat, the

sacrifices it entails, and the conditions it requires. We shall now look at the
way it is carried out.

The first question to be examined is that of the direction taken by the

retreat.

It should lead to the interior of the country—if possible, in fact, toward a

point where the enemy will be surrounded by our territory on all sides, and
is completely exposed to its effects. In such a case the defender runs no risk
of being diverted from the heart of his territory, as he would if he chose a
line of retreat too close to the frontier. That could easily have happened to
the Russians in 1812 if they had decided to retreat in a southerly rather than
an easterly direction.

This condition is implied by the very aim of such a retreat. Which point

in the country is the right one, how far it is consonant with the intention of
directly covering the capital or some other vital point, or of drawing the
enemy away from it—these matters depend on circumstances.

If in 1812 the Russians had planned their withdrawal in advance and

carried it out accordingly, they could easily have gone from Smolensk
toward Kaluga instead of taking that direction only after leaving Moscow. It
is quite possible that under those circumstances, Moscow might have been
saved altogether.

At Borodino the French were 130,000 strong; there is no reason to

suppose that they would have been any stronger if the Russians had

accepted battle half-way to Kaluga. But in that case how many men could
the French have spared to march on Moscow? Obviously very few. But
Moscow is 250 miles from Smolensk, and one cannot send a small force
over that sort of a distance to take a place like Moscow.

he had felt he could risk detaching a force to capture Moscow before
fighting another major battle, and had sent off 40,000 men. He would then
have had 120,000 left to face the main Russian army. But only 90,000 of
them could have taken part—40,000 less than fought at Borodino. That
would have left the Russians stronger by 30,000. If the course of the battle
of Borodino is any guide, that is a margin with which the Russians might
have been victorious. At any rate, according to this calculation, their
chances would have been better than at Borodino. But the Russian retreat
was not the result of advance planning. They retired as far as they did
because whenever they had the chance to accept battle, they did not feel
strong enough to do so. All their supplies and reinforcements were directed
toward the road from Moscow to Smolensk, and nobody at Smolensk would
have dreamed of leaving it. Besides a victory somewhere between
Smolensk and Kaluga would not, in Russian eyes, have justified the
disgrace of leaving Moscow unprotected and exposed to possible capture.

attacked if he had taken up position obliquely—behind the Canal de
Bourgogne, for example—leaving only a few thousand men and the large
National Guard to hold the capital. The allies would never have dared to
send 50,000 to 60,000 men toward Paris, knowing that Bonaparte was at
Auxerre with 100,000 men. Conversely, had the allies been in Napoleon’s
position, it is certain that no one would have dared to suggest that they
leave the road to their capital uncovered while Bonaparte was on the
offensive. With that much superiority he would not have hesitated a
moment before marching on the capital. It simply shows the difference
moral and psychological factors can make, even where all other
circumstances are the same.

one is trying to save, should have sufficient powers of resistance to protect
it against capture or plunder by any raiding party that happens to come

along. We shall leave this subject, which will be taken up again when we
consider the war plans.

attention—that of a sudden change of direction. The Russians kept to the
same direction as far as Moscow, beyond which it would have led them to
Vladimir. Leaving it, they headed first for Riazan, then switched toward
Kaluga. If they had been forced to continue their retreat, they could easily
have done so in this new direction, which would have led them to Kiev—
thus returning much closer to the enemy’s frontier. Even if the French had
still been superior at that stage, they could obviously not have held the
enormous bend in their line of communication, which ran through Moscow.
They would have had to abandon not only Moscow but most likely also
Smolensk—in other words, they would have had to give up the territory
they had occupied at such expense, and content themselves with the theater
of operations west of the Beresina.

if it had headed for Kiev in the first place—the danger of being cut off from
the main part of the country. But this disadvantage had practically
disappeared: the French would have arrived at Kiev in a very different
condition if they had not taken the road by way of Moscow.

direction of the line of retreat—which is quite feasible if the distances
involved are large enough:

1. The turn makes it impossible for the enemy to maintain his existing

lines of communication. Setting up new ones is always difficult; what
is more, the direction changes only gradually, and therefore new lines
of communication will have to be established several times.

2. The result is to bring both armies closer to the frontier again. The

invader is no longer able to use his position to cover the territory he
has conquered, and he will most likely be forced to abandon it. In a
country as immense as Russia, two armies could easily play a regular
game of tag with one another.

 
Under favorable conditions a turn of this sort is possible even where

smaller distances are involved. But every case must be decided on its own

merits in the light of all the circumstances.

Once the direction in which the enemy is to be led into the country has

been determined, the main defending force must move that way. Otherwise,
the enemy will not follow it, and even if he did, the defender would not be
able to impose all the restrictions which we have assumed above. The only
question is whether to take that route with an undivided force, or move
sideways with substantial portions of it, thereby retreating along divergent
lines.

reasons:

1. It is a further dispersal of forces, whereas their concentration in one

area would present a major obstacle to the invader.

2. The enemy thereby enjoys the advantage of interior lines. He will then

be better concentrated than the defender and have greater superiority at
any given point. Admittedly, this superiority is to be feared less if from
the beginning our plan aims at avoiding battle. But this depends on the
enemy continuing to respect our strength and not feeling free to push
us around, which could conceivably happen. This type of retreat
further implies that one main force will eventually gain the upper
hand, so that it can strike a decisive blow. But one cannot count on this
once the force has been split up.

3. Concentric operations are simply unsuited to the weaker side.
4. A divergent retreat cancels out part of the enemy’s weakness.
 
The main weak points of an attack that penetrates deeply are, of course,

the long lines of communication and the exposed strategic flanks. A retreat
that takes a divergent form obliges the attacker to show a front to the flank
with one part of his force; and although that part is really only meant to
contain the forces facing it, it may incidentally serve an additional purpose
—that of covering part of the lines of communication.

In short, so far as the purely strategic value of the retreat is concerned,

the divergent form is not advantageous. If it is to pave the way for future
action against the enemy’s line of retreat, we must refer to the content of the
previous chapter.

which it serves to protect provinces that would otherwise be occupied by
the enemy.

can usually be predicted fairly accurately from the concentration and
direction of his forces, and the location of his territory, fortresses and so
forth, in relation to our own. It would be a dangerous dissipation of strength
if we were to station our fighting forces in areas that will probably not be
touched. Whether one would be able to prevent an occupation, by stationing
troops in areas likely to be occupied, is a great deal harder to predict. It is
largely a matter of judgment.

When the Russians retreated in 1812, they left 30,000 men under

Tormasov to defend Volhynia from invasion by the Austrians. Considering
the size of that province, the number of natural obstacles it presents, and the
unimpressive force that was supposed to invade it, the Russians had
reasonable hope that they could keep the upper hand on that stretch of their
frontier, or, at any rate, maintain themselves nearby. If they were able to
hold their position, solid advantages could be expected to accrue in the
future, which need not be discussed here. In any case, it would have been
almost impossible for these forces to rejoin the main army in time, even if
that had been intended. All these factors amply justified the Russians’
leaving this force to fight an independent war in Volhynia. On the other
hand, according to the plan submitted by General Phull, only Barclay’s
force of 80,000 men was to retire into Drissa. Bagration with 40,000 men
was to operate on the right flank, with the intention of falling on the French
rear later. One will realize at a glance that this force had not the slightest
hope of holding out in southern Lithuania—holding additional territory,
that is, and closer to the rear of the French. It would have been demolished
by their overwhelming numbers.

possible to the invader, but this always remains a secondary aim. It is also
obvious that an attack becomes more difficult the smaller, or rather, the
more limited the theater of operations to which the invader can be confined.
Yet all these considerations assume the probability of success and that they
will not weaken the main force too much—because it is with this force that
one must primarily seek the final result. Difficulties encountered by the

enemy’s main force are most likely to cause him to retreat, and will increase
to the greatest degree the loss of physical and moral forces incurred on the
retreat.

undertaken by an unbeaten and undivided force. It should retire
immediately ahead of the enemy’s main force, as slowly as possible. By
maintaining continuous resistance, it should keep the enemy in a constant
state of alarm, forcing him into the fatal extravagance, so to speak, of
tactical and strategic precautions.

offensive, the defender should, if at all possible, take up a position at an
angle to the direction of that line and exert pressure on the enemy’s rear by
all means at his disposal.

All these features and their effects are displayed to a high degree by the

Russian campaign of 1812, as through a magnifying glass. Even though it
was not a voluntary retreat, it can be regarded as one, since there can be no
doubt that if the Russians, knowing what they know now, had to repeat it
under the same conditions, they would do systematically what they did,
mostly unintentionally, in 1812. One would be quite wrong, however, in
assuming that the same effect has never been produced, and never can be,
where the Russian dimensions of space are lacking.

present—no matter what modifying circumstances may have attended them
in addition—wherever a strategic attack has foundered, not as a
consequence of a decisive battle, but because of the sheer problems of
existence; which forced the invader to undertake a retreat that, to smaller or
greater extent, proved disastrous. Frederick the Great’s campaigns of 1742
in Moravia and 1744 in Bohemia, the French campaign of 1743 in Austria
and Bohemia, the Duke of Brunswick’s of 1792 in France, and Masséna’s
winter campaign of 1810—1811 in Portugal, are examples that illustrate
cases that are similar though much more limited in scale and circumstances.
Moreover, there are countless other situations where the principle
established here was partly, if not completely responsible for the result. We
do not cite them because it would mean going into unnecessary detail.

In Russia, and in all the other cases mentioned here, the tide turned

without a victorious battle to provide the decision at the point of

culmination. Even where such an effect cannot be expected, it remains
sufficiently important to bring about, by means of this type of resistance, a
change in the relative strength of both sides, that will make victory a
possibility. Once that has been won, one must ensure that it touches off a
series of calamities, which, in accordance with the law of falling bodies,
will keep gathering momentum.

CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX

The first objection does not concern us at all: here we consider a general

insurrection as simply another means of war—in its relation, therefore, to
the enemy. The second objection, on the other hand, leads us to remark that
a popular uprising should, in general, be considered as an outgrowth of the
way in which the conventional barriers have been swept away in our
lifetime by the elemental violence of war. It is, in fact, a broadening and
intensification of the fermentation process known as war. The system of
requisitioning, and the enormous growth of armies resulting from it and
from universal conscription, the employment of militia—all of these run in
the same direction when viewed from the standpoint of the older, narrower
military system, and that also leads to the calling out of the home guard and
arming the people.

The innovations first mentioned were the natural, inevitable

consequences of the breaking down of barriers. They added so immensely
to the strength of the side that first employed them that the opponent was
carried along and had to follow suit. That will also hold true of the people’s
war. Any nation that uses it intelligently will, as a rule, gain some
superiority over those who disdain its use. If this is so, the question only
remains whether mankind at large will gain by this further expansion of the
element of war; a question to which the answer should be the same as to the
question of war itself. We shall leave both to the philosophers. But it can be

argued that the resources expended in an insurrection might be put to better
use in other kinds of warfare. No lengthy investigation is needed, however,
to uncover the fact that these resources are, for the most part, not otherwise
available and cannot be disposed of at will. Indeed, a significant part of
them, the psychological element, is called into being only by this type of
usage.

longer, “Of what value is this to the people,” but “what is its potential value,
what are the conditions that it requires, and how is it to be utilized.”

By its very nature, such scattered resistance will not lend itself to major

actions, closely compressed in time and space. Its effect is like that of the
process of evaporation: it depends on how much surface is exposed. The
greater the surface and the area of contact between it and the enemy forces,
the thinner the latter have to be spread, the greater the effect of a general
uprising. Like smoldering embers, it consumes the basic foundations of the
enemy forces. Since it needs time to be effective, a state of tension will
develop while the two elements interact. This tension will either gradually
relax, if the insurgency is suppressed in some places and slowly burns itself
out in others, or else it will build up to a crisis: a general conflagration
closes in on the enemy, driving him out of the country before he is faced
with total destruction. For an uprising by itself to produce such a crisis
presupposes an occupied area of a size that, in Europe, does not exist
outside Russia, or a disproportion between the invading army and the size
of the country that would never occur in practice. To be realistic, one must
therefore think of a general insurrection within the framework of a war
conducted by the regular army, and coordinated in one all-encompassing
plan.

be effective:

1. The war must be fought in the interior of the country.
2. It must not be decided by a single stroke.
3. The theater of operations must be fairly large.
4. The national character must be suited to that type of war.
5. The country must be rough and inaccessible, because of mountains, or

forests, marshes, or the local methods of cultivation.

 
The relative density of the population does not play a decisive part; rarely

are there not enough people for the purpose. Nor does it make much
difference whether the population is rich or poor—at least it should not be a
major consideration, although one must remember that poor men, used to
hard, strenuous work and privation, are generally more vigorous and more
warlike.

One peculiarity of the countryside that greatly enhances the effectiveness

of an insurrection is the scattered distribution of houses and farms, which,
for instance, can be found in many parts of Germany. Under such
conditions the country will be more cut up and thickly wooded, the roads
poorer if more numerous; the billeting of troops will prove infinitely more
difficult, and, above all, the most characteristic feature of insurgency in
general will be constantly repeated in miniature: the element of resistance
will exist everywhere and nowhere. Where the population is concentrated in
villages, the most restless communities can be garrisoned, or even looted
and burned down as punishment; but that could scarcely be done in, say, a
Westphalian farming area.

Militia and bands of armed civilians cannot and should not be employed

against the main enemy force—or indeed against any sizable enemy force.
They are not supposed to pulverize the core but to nibble at the shell and
around the edges. They are meant to operate in areas just outside the theater
of war—where the invader will not appear in strength—in order to deny
him these areas altogether. Thunder clouds of this type should build up all
around the invader the farther he advances. The people who have not yet
been conquered by the enemy will be the most eager to arm against him;
they will set an example that will gradually be followed by their neighbors.
The flames will spread like a brush fire, until they reach the area on which
the enemy is based, threatening his lines of communication and his very
existence. One need not hold an exaggerated faith in the power of a general
uprising, nor consider it as an inexhaustible, unconquerable force, which an
army cannot hope to stop any more than man can command the wind or the
rain—in short, one need not base one’s judgment on patriotic broadsides in
order to admit that peasants in arms will not let themselves be swept along
like a platoon of soldiers. The latter will cling together like a herd of cattle
and generally follow their noses; peasants, on the other hand, will scatter

and vanish in all directions, without requiring a special plan. This explains
the highly dangerous character that a march through mountains, forests, or
other types of difficult country can assume for a small detachment: at any
moment the march may turn into a fight. An area may have long since been
cleared of enemy troops, but a band of peasants that was long since driven
off by the head of a column may at any moment reappear at its tail. When it
comes to making roads unusable and blocking narrow passes, the means
available to outposts or military raiding parties and those of an insurgent
peasantry have about as much in common as the movements of an
automaton have with those of a man. The enemy’s only answer to militia
actions is the sending out of frequent escorts as protection for his convoys,
and as guards on all his stopping places, bridges, defiles, and the rest. The
early efforts of the militia may be fairly weak, and so will these first
detachments, because of the dangers of dispersal. But the flames of
insurrection will be fanned by these small detachments, which will on
occasion be overpowered by sheer numbers; courage and the appetite for
fighting will rise, and so will the tension, until it reaches the climax that
decides the outcome.

resistance should never materialize as a concrete body, otherwise the enemy
can direct sufficient force at its core, crush it, and take many prisoners.
When that happens, the people will lose heart and, believing that the issue
has been decided and further efforts would be useless, drop their weapons.
On the other hand, there must be some concentration at certain points: the
fog must thicken and form a dark and menacing cloud out of which a bolt of
lightning may strike at any time. These points for concentration will, as we
have said, lie mainly on the flanks of the enemy’s theater of operations.
That is where insurgents should build up larger units, better organized, with
parties of regulars that will make them look like a proper army and enable
them to tackle larger operations. From these areas the strength of the
insurgency must increase as it nears the enemy’s rear, where he is
vulnerable to its strongest blows. The larger groups are intended to harass
the more considerable units that the enemy sends back; they will also
arouse uneasiness and fear, and deepen the psychological effect of the
insurrection as a whole. Without them the impression would not be

sufficiently great, nor would the general situation give the enemy enough
cause for alarm.

by supporting the insurgents with small units of the regular army. Without
these regular troops to provide encouragement, the local inhabitants will
usually lack the confidence and initiative to take to arms. The stronger the
units detailed for the task, the greater their power of attraction and the
bigger the ultimate avalanche. But there are limiting factors. For one thing,
it could be fatal to the army to be frittered away on secondary objectives of
that kind—to be dissolved, so to speak, in the insurgency—merely to form a
long and tenuous defensive line, which is a sure way of destroying army
and insurgents alike. For another, experience tends to show that too many
regulars in an area are liable to decimate the vigor and effectiveness of a
popular uprising by attracting too many enemy troops; also, the inhabitants
will place too much reliance upon the regulars; and finally, the presence of
considerable numbers of troops taxes the local resources in other ways,
such as billets, transportation, requisitions, and so forth.

Another means of avoiding an effective enemy reaction to a popular

uprising is, at the same time, one of the basic principles of insurrection: it is
the principle of seldom, or never, allowing this important strategic means of
defense to turn into tactical defense. Insurgent actions are similar in
character to all others fought by second-rate troops: they start out full of
vigor and enthusiasm, but there is little level-headedness and tenacity in the
long run. Moreover, not much is lost if a body of insurgents is defeated and
dispersed—that is what it is for. But it should not be allowed to go to pieces
through too many men being killed, wounded or taken prisoner: such
defeats would soon dampen its ardor. Both these characteristics are entirely
alien to the nature of a tactical defense. A defensive action ought to be a
slow, persistent, calculated business, entailing a definite risk; mere attempts
that can be broken off at will can never lead to a successful defense. So if
the defense of a sector is entrusted to the home guard, one must avoid
getting involved in a major defensive battle, or else they will perish no
matter how favorable the circumstances. They may and should defend the
points of access to a mountain area or the dikes across a marsh or points at
which a river can be crossed for as long as possible; but once these are
breached, they had better scatter and continue their resistance by means of

surprise attacks, rather than huddle together in a narrow redoubt, locked
into a regular defensive position from which there is no escape. No matter
how brave a people is, how warlike its traditions, how great its hatred for
the enemy, how favorable the ground on which it fights: the fact remains
that a national uprising cannot maintain itself where the atmosphere is too
full of danger. Therefore, if its fuel is to be fanned into a major
conflagration, it must be at some distance, where there is enough air, and
the uprising cannot be smothered by a single stroke.

This discussion has been less an objective analysis than a groping for the

truth. The reason is that this sort of warfare is not as yet very common;
those who have been able to observe it for any length of time have not
reported enough about it. We merely wish to add that strategic plans for
defense can provide for a general insurrection in one of two ways: either as
a last resort after a defeat or as a natural auxiliary before a decisive battle.
The latter use presupposes a withdrawal to the interior and the form of
indirect defense described in Chapters Eight and Twenty-Four of this book.
Therefore, we shall add only a few words concerning the calling out of the
home guard after a battle has been lost.

A government must never assume that its country’s fate, its whole

existence, hangs on the outcome of a single battle, no matter how decisive.
Even after a defeat, there is always the possibility that a turn of fortune can
be brought about by developing new sources of internal strength or through
the natural decimation all offensives suffer in the long run or by means of
help from abroad. There will always be time enough to die; like a drowning
man who will clutch instinctively at a straw, it is the natural law of the
moral world that a nation that finds itself on the brink of an abyss will try to
save itself by any means.

No matter how small and weak a state may be in comparison with its

enemy, it must not forego these last efforts, or one would conclude that its
soul is dead. The possibility of avoiding total ruin by paying a high price for
peace should not be ruled out, but even this intention will not, in turn,
eliminate the usefulness of new measures of defense. They will not make
the peace more difficult and onerous, but easier and better. They are even
more desirable where help can be expected from other states that have an
interest in our survival. A government that after having lost a major battle,
is only interested in letting its people go back to sleep in peace as soon as

possible, and, overwhelmed by feelings of failure and disappointment, lacks
the courage and desire to put forth a final effort, is, because of its weakness,
involved in a major inconsistency in any case. It shows that it did not
deserve to win, and, possibly for that very reason was unable to.

the defeat of a state—the potential of fortresses and general insurrections
must be evoked. In this respect, it will be advantageous if the flanks of the
main theater of operations are bordered by mountains or other difficult
terrain, which will then emerge as bastions, raking the invader with their
strategic enfilade.

Once the victor is engaged in sieges, once he has left strong garrisons all

along the way to form his line of communication, or has even sent out
detachments to secure his freedom of movement and keep adjoining
provinces from giving him trouble; once he has been weakened by a variety
of losses in men and matériel, the time has come for the defending army to
take the field again. Then a well-placed blow on the attacker in his difficult
situation will be enough to shake him.

CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN

Defense, as we see it, is nothing but the stronger form of combat. The

preservation of one’s fighting forces and the destruction of the enemy’s—in
a word, victory—is the substance of this struggle; but it can never be its
ultimate object.

The ultimate object is the preservation of one’s own state and the defeat

of the enemy’s; again in brief, the intended peace treaty, which will resolve
the conflict and result in a common settlement.

But what, in the context of war, is meant by the enemy state? First of all

his fighting forces; then his territory. Of course, it means a great many other
things as well, which, depending on circumstances, can attain genuine
significance. Chief among these are the foreign and domestic political
conditions, which are sometimes more decisive than anything else. But

although the enemy’s fighting forces and his territory may not be the state
itself, nor represent all his means of making war, they will always be the
dominant factors, and usually they far exceed all others in importance. The
fighting forces are meant to protect their own territory and to seize the
enemy’s: it is the territory, on the other hand, that sustains them and keeps
restoring their strength. Each, then, depends on the other. They give mutual
support and are of equal value to each other. But while they interact, they
do so with a difference. If the forces are destroyed—in other words,
overcome and incapable of further resistance—the country is automatically
lost. On the other hand, loss of the country does not automatically entail
destruction of the forces; they can evacuate the country of their own accord,
in order to reconquer it the more easily later on. Not only the complete
annihilation, but any considerable weakening of the fighting forces, will
generally lead to a loss of territory. Conversely, however, not every
considerable loss of territory automatically leads to a weakening of the
forces. It will happen in the long run, of course, but not always within the
decisive phase of the war.

be, destroy armed forces than to hold on to territory—in other words, the
former must be a general’s prime concern. The possession of territory will
become an end in itself only where those means are not enough in
themselves.

consisted of a single battle, possession of the country would turn on that
battle’s outcome. The destruction of the enemy’s forces, the occupation of
his territory, and the safety of one’s own would follow automatically and, in
a sense, be identical with it. The question now arises, what will cause the
defender to abandon this, the simplest of all forms of war, in the first place,
and disperse his forces in space? The answer lies in the inadequacy of the
victory that he can achieve with his combined forces. Each victory has its
own sphere of influence. If that sphere includes the whole of the enemy
state—fighting forces, territory, and all—in other words, if all the
components of his strength are carried away in the very torrent that has hit
its core, that victory is all that is needed. There will be no need for a
division of forces. If, on the other hand, parts of the enemy’s forces and of
both countries are beyond the scope of our victory, these parts will require

special attention. Since one cannot concentrate land as one can an army, it
will be necessary to divide the army in order to defend the land.

force possible and probable that its defeat will decide everything. If the area
involved is very large and the frontier long, or if one is surrounded on all
sides by a powerful alliance of enemies, such a concentration is a practical
impossibility. A division of forces then becomes inevitable, and with it,
several theaters of operation.

scale of the victory, and that in turn depends on the size of the defeated
force. For this reason, the blow from which the broadest and most favorable
repercussions can be expected will be aimed against that area where the
greatest concentration of enemy troops can be found; the larger the force
with which the blow is struck, the surer its effect will be. This rather
obvious sequence leads us to an analogy that will illustrate it more clearly
—that is, the nature and effect of a center of gravity.

densely. It presents the most effective target for a blow; furthermore, the
heaviest blow is that struck by the center of gravity. The same holds true in
war. The fighting forces of each belligerent—whether a single state or an
alliance of states—have a certain unity and therefore some cohesion. Where
there is cohesion, the analogy of the center of gravity can be applied. Thus,
these forces will possess certain centers of gravity, which, by their
movement and direction, govern the rest; and those centers of gravity will
be found wherever the forces are most concentrated. But in war as in the
world of inanimate matter the effect produced on a center of gravity is
determined and limited by the cohesion of the parts. In either case, a blow
may well be stronger than the resistance requires, and in that case it may
strike nothing but air, and so be a waste of energy.

into battle under the personal command of a single general, and that of an
allied force extending over 250 or 500 miles, or even operating against
different fronts. In the one, cohesion is at its strongest and unity at its
closest. In the other, unity is remote, frequently found only in mutual
political interests, and even then rather precarious and imperfect; cohesion
between the parts will usually be very loose, and often completely fictitious.

that our strength be concentrated to the utmost; on the other, any excess is
to be regarded as a decided disadvantage, since it involves a waste of
energy, which in turn means a lack of strength elsewhere.

centers of gravity in the enemy’s forces and to identify their spheres of
effectiveness. One will constantly be called upon to estimate the effect that
an advance or a retreat by part of the forces on either side will have upon
the rest.

Far from believing we have discovered a new technique, we are merely

providing a rationale for the actions of every general in history, which
serves to explain their connection with the nature of the problem.

enemy’s force operates throughout the plan of war. In fact, that is where the
matter properly belongs; we have merely drawn on it here in order not to
leave a gap in the present argument. Our reflections are intended to
demonstrate the general reasons for dividing one’s forces. Basically, there
are two conflicting interests: one, possession of the country, tends to
disperse the fighting forces; the other, a stroke at the center of gravity of the
enemy’s forces, tends, in some degree, to keep them concentrated.

This is how operational theaters, or individual armies’ zones of

operations, are created. A country and the forces stationed there are divided
in such a way that any decision obtained by the main force in a particular
theater directly affects the whole and carries everything along with it. We
say directly, since any decision reached in one particular operational theater
is also bound to have a more or less remote effect on adjoining areas.

We want to reiterate emphatically that here, as elsewhere, our definitions

are aimed only at the centers of certain concepts; we neither wish nor can
give them sharp outlines. The nature of the matter should make this obvious
enough.

Our position, then, is that a theater of war, be it large or small, and the

forces stationed there, no matter what their size, represent the sort of unity
in which a single center of gravity can be identified. That is the place where
the decision should be reached; a victory at that point is in its fullest sense
identical with the defense of the theater of operations.

CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

We must begin by pointing out that the state of waiting is not the sum

total of the term “defense.” It is, however, the phase by which a defense
approaches its goal. So long as a fighting unit has not abandoned the area
assigned to it, the tension that an attack creates on both sides will continue.
Only a decision can put an end to it; and that decision, whatever it may be,
can only be considered a fact after either the attacker or the defender has
abandoned the theater of war.

So long as a force maintains itself in its area, its defense of that area

continues, and in that sense one can say that defense of an operational
theater is the same thing as defense within it. It is immaterial how much or
how little of the area is temporarily occupied by the enemy; it is merely lent
to him.

This conceptualization, which is meant to clarify the true relationship

between the state of waiting and the whole, is valid only if a decision is
really intended, and is regarded as inevitable by both sides. It is the decision
that changes the centers of gravity on each side, and the operational theaters
they create, into active agents. If one drops the idea of a decision, the
centers of gravity are neutralized, and so, indeed, in a certain sense, are all
the forces. At this point, possession of the country, the next most important
component of the theater of war, will become a direct objective—in other
words, the importance of possessing the country increases, the less a
decision is actively sought by the belligerents, and the more the war
becomes a matter of mutual observation. The defender will be more intent
on the immediate coverage of all he has, while the attacker increasingly
attempts to spread his forces out in his advance.

a state of observation than a struggle of life and death—a struggle, that is,
in which at least one of the parties is determined to gain a decision. A
theory based on this idea could be applied only to the wars of the nineteenth
century, which alone have displayed that characteristic to such a high
degree. Not every future war, however, is likely to be of this type; on the
contrary, one may predict that most wars will tend to revert to wars of
observation. A theory, to be of any practical use, must allow for that
likelihood. We shall, therefore, start by considering the kind of war that is
completely governed and saturated by the urge for a decision—of true war,
or absolute war, if we may call it that. In a later chapter we shall consider
the modifications that arise from a greater or lesser approximation to a war
of observation.

decision or it is sought by the defender; for present purposes it does not
matter which. Here the defense of a theater of war will consist of
maintaining the position in such a way as to be able to bring about an
advantageous decision at any moment. Such a decision may be made up of
a single battle or a series of major engagements; it may also consist,
however, of the mere effect of the relationships that arise from the
disposition of both forces—in other words, from possible engagements.

Even if a battle were not the primary, the most common, the most

effective means of reaching a decision (as we think we have already shown
more than once) the mere fact that it is one of the means of obtaining a
decision should be enough to call for the utmost possible concentration of
strength permissible under the circumstances. A major battle in a theater of
operations is a collision between two centers of gravity; the more forces we
can concentrate in our center of gravity, the more certain and massive the
effect will be. Consequently, any partial use of force not directed toward an
objective that either cannot be attained by the victory itself or that does not
bring about the victory should be condemned.

possible concentration of forces; they must also be deployed in a way that
enables them to fight under sufficiently favorable circumstances.

The various gradations of defense, which were dealt with in the chapter

on types of resistance, are completely consonant with these basic

conditions; there can, therefore, be no difficulty in establishing a connection
between them according to the needs of the individual case. There is only
one point that, at first sight, seems self-contradictory, and that, because it is
one of the most important points in defense, is all the more in need of
further development: it is how to hit the enemy’s exact center of gravity.

If the defender finds out early enough by what roads the enemy will

advance, and on which of them the core of his force is to be found, he will
be able to confront him there. That is what normally happens; for while
defense may anticipate attack by general precautions—such as building
fortresses, stocking major arms depots, and peacetime disposition of forces,
thus establishing the lines that the attack must follow when actual hostilities
begin—the defender also possesses the inherent advantage over the
offensive of being able to make the riposte.

An advance into enemy territory by a sizable force calls for considerable

preparations such as building up food stocks and supplies or equipment and
so forth. This will take long enough to give the defender time to make his
own preparations. And one must not forget that the defender normally needs
less time than the attacker, since all states are usually better prepared for
defense than for attack.

But while this may be perfectly true in the majority of cases, the

possibility still remains that in a particular instance the defense may not be
sure of the main route of the enemy’s advance. This is more probable when
the defense relies on measures that themselves take time, such as the
preparation of a strong position. Furthermore, even where the defender is
blocking the line of advance—provided he does not himself assume the
offensive by giving battle—the attacker can avoid the defender’s position
by a slight change in his original line of march. In the settled parts of
Europe one will never be at a loss for roads on which to by-pass a position
on one side or another. In that case the defender obviously will not await his
opponent in position, not at least with the intention of giving battle there.

situation, we must examine it more closely and consider the probability of
its arising.

concern here) there will, of course, be certain objectives and points that
offer the most effective target for an attack. The detailed discussion of this

topic belongs in the book on the attack. At this stage we merely want to
stipulate the following: if the most advantageous objective and target of
attack determines the direction of the offensive, the same reasoning will
affect the defender as well, and must guide his dispositions whenever he
does not know the intentions of his opponent. If the attacker were to fail to
take the most favorable direction, he would forfeit some of his natural
advantages. If the defender does lie across that route, the remedy of
avoiding and by-passing him is clearly no bargain; it has to be paid for. It
follows, therefore, that neither the defender’s risk of misjudging the
direction of the attack nor the enemy’s ability to by-pass him is so great as
might at first appear. In fact, a definite and usually overriding reason for
taking one route or the other is already given. Thus, the defender, though
his dispositions may be tied to a certain place, is generally in no danger of
missing the enemy’s main force. In other words, if the defender has taken
up the right position, he can be fairly sure that the attacker will seek him
out there.

Still, there is no denying the possibility that the defender’s dispositions

may at times fail to connect with the attack. The question therefore arises
what to do then, and how much of the original advantage of his situation
will still remain.

The choices open to a defender who is being by-passed are the following:

1. He can split his forces in two from the very beginning in order to be

sure to catch the enemy with one part, while the other hurries to its
assistance.

2. He can concentrate his forces in one position, and if the enemy passes

him by, move quickly to the flank. In most cases, such an advance can
no longer be made precisely to the flank: the new position will have to
be taken somewhat further to the rear.

3. He can throw his full force at the enemy’s flank.
4. He can operate against the enemy’s lines of communication.
5. He can mount a counterattack on the enemy’s theater of operations,

thereby producing the same effect on the enemy the latter meant to
produce in by-passing him.

which it would be effective. But basically it conflicts with the intent of the
defense, or rather with the reasons for which it was chosen. It must,
therefore, be considered as an abnormal situation that can be caused only by
major errors on the part of the enemy or by other peculiarities of the
individual case.

superiority of our own line of communication, which, indeed, is one of the
basic elements of a good defensive position. But while such an action
promises the defender some benefits, in defending a theater of operations it
seldom leads to the decision that we have assumed to be the object of the
campaign.

A single theater of operations is rarely large enough to make the

attacker’s lines of communication critically vulnerable. Even if they were,
the effects of an action against them are too gradual to delay seriously the
execution of the enemy’s plans, which usually do not require much time.

totally ineffective if the enemy is bent on gaining a decision—nor will it
help bring about a decision for the defender.

The three other means left to the defender are more suited to the

objective, because they aim at an immediate decision, a confrontation of the
two centers of gravity. We shall say at once, however, that we decidedly
prefer the third to the other two. While we would not reject these
completely, we believe the third to be the appropriate means of resistance in
most cases.

By splitting one’s forces, one is in danger of getting involved in a war of

outposts: against a determined enemy, this will at best result in a substantial
limited resistance, but never in the decision that was intended. Even if that
pitfall can be avoided, the assault will be noticeably weakened because of
the temporary split in the defense. Nor can one ever be sure that the
advance units will not suffer disproportionate losses. Furthermore, the
resistance rendered by these units generally ends in their falling back on the
main force, which is hurrying to their support. To the troops this will
usually look like a defeat or failure, and will in this way significantly lower
their morale.

very route by which he means to evade us—involves the risk of arriving too
late, and thereby falling between two stools. What is more, a defensive
battle calls for calm, reflection, knowledge of the area, indeed real
familiarity with it; none of these can be expected if we are engaged in rapid
movements. Finally, positions that make good defensive battlefields are
scarce; one cannot assume that one will find them on every road and at
every turn.

the attacker from the flank and thereby forcing him to fight a battle with a
change of front.

his lines of communication—in this case lines of retreat. The advantage that
accrues to the defender derives from his condition in general, but more
especially from the strategic properties that we have claimed for his
position.

Furthermore—and this is the main point—an attacker trying to by-pass

his enemy is involved in doing two incompatible things simultaneously. His
first concern is to advance and reach his objective; but as he may be
attacked from the flank at any moment, he feels he must also be ready to
strike back instantly, and with full force. These two aims are mutually
exclusive: they create so much confusion and make it so difficult to cover
all eventualities that one would be hard put to conceive of a worse strategic
situation. If the attacker knew exactly when and where he would be
assaulted, he could prepare himself with skill and resource; but in his
uncertainty and the necessity of keeping up his advance, a sudden battle can
scarcely fail to find him badly concentrated, and thus certainly not in an
advantageous position.

If there is ever a suitable occasion for the defender to fight an offensive

battle, one must surely expect it under such circumstances. If we further
bear in mind that the defender has the advantage in knowledge and choice
of terrain, that he is able to prepare his movements and initiate them, there
can be no doubt that under these circumstances he will retain definite
strategic superiority over his enemy.

well-placed position can safely wait to be by-passed. If his opponent does

not seek him out, and if circumstances prevent the situation from having an
effect on his opponent’s lines of communication, he still has an excellent
means of producing a decision by falling on the enemy’s flank.

dare to hold out in such a position; they would rather split their forces or
hasten to cut the attacker off by means of oblique or lateral marches.
Besides, an attacker will not dare to by-pass a defender under such
circumstances, and this usually brings him to a halt.

In such a case, then, the defender is forced to fight an offensive battle and

to forego the further benefits of waiting, of a strong position, and of good
entrenchments, etc. As a rule, the situation in which he finds the advancing
enemy will not completely make up for the lack of these advantages; after
all, it was to circumvent them that the attacker exposed himself to these
conditions. It does afford a certain amount of compensation, however. Thus,
this is not an instance where the theorist finds that a quantity has suddenly
vanished and pro and contra cancel each other out, as so often happens
when military critics introduce a fragment of theory into their work.

We do not mean to imply that this is a matter of logical subtleties; on the

contrary, the more one looks at the practical side of the matter, the more one
sees that the idea applies to the whole field of defense, ruling and
permeating its every aspect.

Only if the defender is determined to attack the enemy in full strength as

soon as he has been by-passed can he avoid the two pitfalls that beset his
path so closely—a divided position and a hasty advance. Either way he is
governed by the conditions of the offensive; either way he must make do
with makeshift expedients and dangerous haste. Consequently, wherever a
determined adversary, intent on pursuing victory and reaching a decision,
has encountered this type of defensive system, he has demolished it. On the
other hand, a defender who has concentrated his troops to fight as a single
force in the right place, and who is determined to attack the enemy in the
flank if things come to the worst, is and will be on the right course, backed
up by all the advantages defense can offer in his situation. Sound
preparation, composure, confidence, unity, and simplicity will mark his
conduct of the action.

In this connection we cannot help but mention an important historical

mainly to prevent erroneous deductions. In October 1806, the Prussian
army in Thuringia lay in wait for Bonaparte between the two main roads on
which he could advance—the road via Erfurt, and that via Hof toward
Leipzig and Berlin. This intermediate position resulted from an earlier
intention to advance straight through the Thuringian Forest into Franconia,
and later, when this plan had been abandoned, from uncertainty as to which
of the two roads the French would use. It should, therefore, have led to a
rapid move to block the French advance.

way of Erfurt, for the roads that led there were perfectly accessible. On the
other hand, to block the road from Hof was inconceivable, because that
road was two or three days’ march away, and because the deep valley of the
Saale lay between. The Duke of Brunswick had never thought of such a
move, nor had any sort of preparations been made for it. It had, however,
always been intended by Prince Hohenlohe, or rather by Colonel
Massenbach, who tried his utmost to draw the Duke into this scheme. Still
less tenable was the idea of leaving the position on the left bank of the Saale
to fight an offensive battle against Bonaparte as he advanced—in other
words, of falling on his flank in the way described above: if the river was an
obstacle to a last-minute interception of the enemy, it would be an even
greater obstacle to a sudden attack at a time when he was already in
possession, at least partially, of the far bank. The Duke decided, therefore,
to remain behind the Saale and await developments—if one can speak of a
personal decision at all where such a hydra-headed staff, in a state of chaos
and perpetual vacillation, was concerned.

resulted were as follows:

a. The enemy could be attacked as he crossed the Saale to advance on the

Prussian army or

b. If he chose to leave the Prussians alone, his line of communication

could be harassed, or

c. If it was feasible and advisable, the enemy could still be intercepted at

Leipzig by means of a rapid march to the flank.

army great strategic and tactical superiority. In the second instance, the
Prussians’ purely strategic superiority was just as great, for the enemy’s
base between them and the neutral territory of Bohemia was very narrow,
whereas the Prussians’ was exceptionally broad. Even in the third instance,
the Prussians were not at a disadvantage, because they were covered by the
Saale. In spite of confusion and uncertainty, all three of these possibilities
were actually discussed at headquarters. It is not surprising, however, that
while an idea might be able to prevail in a state of chaos and indecision, its
execution was bound to perish in such a maelstrom.

would have amounted to a genuine flank-position, and as such its merits
were unquestionably very great; but for an army that was not very sure of
itself, pitted against a vastly superior enemy such as Bonaparte, a flank
position was a very bold measure to adopt.

last of the above three measures, but it was too late. Bonaparte had already
begun to cross the Saale and the battles of Jena and Auerstädt were bound
to follow. In his vacillation, the Duke had fallen between two stools: he had
left the area too late to intercept the enemy, and too early to fight a sound
battle. Nevertheless, the natural strength of his position was so great that he
should have been able to annihilate the right wing of the French at
Auerstaedt, while Prince Hohenlohe, by means of a costly rear guard action,
should have been able to avoid being trapped at Jena. But at Auerstaedt the
Prussians did not dare to hold out for a certain victory; at Jena, where it was
completely impossible, they thought they could count on it.

In any case, Bonaparte’s respect for the strategic value of the position on

the Saale was such that he did not dare to by-pass it, but preferred to cross
the Saale under the enemy’s eyes.

defense to attack in cases calling for decisive action, and defined, according
to their position and coherence, the threads that knit individual parts of a
defense plan together. We do not intend to explore further details, which
would only lead to a boundless maze of individual cases. Once a general
has resolved to pursue a specific objective, he will be able to judge how
circumstances of geography, statistics and politics, and conditions of

matériel and personnel in his own and the enemy’s army will fit into it, and
he may then adjust his plans accordingly.

types of resistance, will now be more clearly defined, and their bearing on
the present matter in general more closely examined.

intention of fighting an offensive battle:

a. If one knows that the enemy’s forces are widely dispersed and that

therefore, even where one’s own strength is inferior, there is some
prospect of victory.

 
A dispersed advance is not very likely; such a plan is therefore sound

only where one has prior knowledge of the enemy’s moves. Merely to make
such an assumption on insufficient grounds, count on it, and base all one’s
expectations on it, will usually lead to an unfavorable situation.
Circumstances may not turn out as expected, the idea of an offensive battle
will have to be abandoned, and no preparation will have been made for a
defensive one. An involuntary retreat has to be initiated, and almost
everything is left to chance.

That is more or less what happened to the defense undertaken by Dohna’s

army against the Russians in the campaign of 1759, which came to a
disastrous end under General Wedel at the battle of Züllichau.108

Because it settles the matter so quickly, planners are only too eager to

propose this type of procedure without verifying the underlying
assumptions.

b. If, in general, one has enough strength for battle, and
c. If a very clumsy, vacillating enemy invites attack.
 
In such a case, the effect of surprise may be of greater value than all the

benefits of terrain in a favorable position. It is the very essence of good
generalship to use the power of psychological forces in this way. Still, a
theorist cannot emphasize loudly and strongly enough that there must be
objective reasons for these assumptions; without such specific reasons it is
unsuitable and quite unwarranted to talk about surprise, or the merits of an

unconventional attack, and to base plans and arguments and criticisms on
them.

d. If the composition of the army makes it particularly suited to the

offensive.

was used to discipline, drilled to perfection, and animated and sustained by
a sense of pride. He was certainly not mistaken or unjustified in his belief
that this army, trained in his method of oblique attack, was an instrument
that in his sure, practiced hand was better suited to attack than for defense.
These were the very qualities that his opponents lacked, and it was these
qualities that gave him a definite superiority. In most cases, they were of
greater value to him than all the benefits of entrenchments and natural
obstacles. Such superiority, however, remains rare: it calls for more than a
well-trained army used to large-scale movements. One should not give too
much credence to Frederick’s remark—which has since been incessantly
repeated—that the Prussian troops were particularly suited to the offensive:
it is normal in a war that spirits and courage are higher in the attacker than
in the defender. This is a feeling common to all troops, and there is hardly
an army whose generals and officers have not advanced the same claim.
One must be careful not to be taken in by this semblance of superiority,
while neglecting some solid advantages.

An army’s composition may constitute a very natural and weighty

argument for fighting an offensive battle—when the army contains
abundant cavalry and not much artillery.

To continue the list of reasons for attacking the enemy:

e. If it is impossible to find a favorable position
f. If the need for a decision is urgent
g. Finally, several or all of these reasons may act together.
 
2. The most natural reasons for awaiting the enemy in an area where one

wants to attack him (as at Minden in 1759) can be found in the following:

a. Where the difference between the forces is not greatly to our

disadvantage, and we are therefore not obliged to look for a strong
entrenched position

b. Where the area is particularly suited to the purpose. The features that

determine this belong to the tactical realm; we might just mention the
main attributes: easy accessibility for our own approach and numerous
obstacles for the enemy’s.

 
3. A position in which one really means to await the enemy should be

taken up:

a. If an imbalance of strength forces us to seek shelter behind natural

obstacles and entrenchments

b. If the terrain is particularly well suited to such a position.
 
The second and third types of resistance will deserve greater

consideration to the degree to which one does not seek the decision oneself,
will be content with a negative success, and can expect the enemy to falter,
show indecision, and finally abandon his intentions.
  

4. An entrenched and unassailable encampment fulfills the purpose only

a. If it is located in an area of particular strategic significance.
 
The distinctive feature of such a position is that it cannot be overrun; the

enemy is thus forced to try every other means available; for instance,
pursuing his objective regardless of the position, or surrounding it and
starving the garrison. If he is unable to do either, the strategic qualities of
such a position are great indeed.

b. If one has reason to expect help from outside.

what has been said about this measure after its unfortunate outcome, the
fact remains that 17,000 Saxons could never have neutralized 40,000
Prussians in any other way. If the Austrian army at Lobositz made no better
use of the superiority it gained from the Prussians’ neutralization, it only

goes to show how poor its whole organization and methods were. There is
no doubt that Frederick the Great would have chased the Austrians and
Saxons beyond Prague in that campaign, and taken the city as well, if the
Saxons, instead of occupying the camp at Pirna, had moved in to Bohemia.
Whoever denies the value of that feat, and only remembers the capture of
the Saxon army, does not know how to calculate matters of this kind, and
without calculation there can be no sure result.

But since cases such as a. and b. are very rare, to resort to the measure of

entrenched camps requires careful reflection. Only seldom is it properly
used. The hope of impressing the enemy with such a camp and thereby
paralyzing his activities is linked to too great a danger—that of having to
fight without a way of retreat. If Frederick gained his objective at
Bunzelwitz in that way, one must admire his accurate evaluation of his
opponents; but one must also lay more stress than would ordinarily be
permissible on the means he would have found to break out with the
remnants of his army if things had gone wrong, and—secondly—on the fact
that as King, he was accountable to no one.
  

question that arises is whether the defender ought to aim at a decision in
front of them or behind them. Reasons for the latter are to be found in:

a. The enemy’s numerical superiority, which forces us to wear him down

before the battle, is joined

b. The proximity of the fortresses, so that the land lost can be kept to an

absolute minimum

c. The defensive capacity of the fortresses.
 
Unquestionably it is, or should be, one of the principal functions of a

fortress to brake the enemy’s advances, and substantially weaken that part
of his forces which we seek to defeat decisively. If fortresses are only rarely
used for this purpose, it stems from the fact that only rarely is a decision
sought by either party. That, however, is the only case we are considering at
the moment. We therefore regard it as a simple but important principle that
a defender who has one or more fortresses in the vicinity should keep them
in his front, and fight the decisive battle behind them. We will admit that a

battle that is lost behind our own fortresses will drive us somewhat further
back into our own country than one that is lost with the same tactical results
in front of them; but the origins of this difference are more imaginary than
real. We also realize that, in a well-chosen position, a battle can be fought
on the far side of the fortresses, while a battle on the near side may in many
cases turn into an offensive one if the enemy lays siege to a fortress and it is
in danger of being taken. But what do these fine points amount to against
the advantage of having the enemy’s strength in the decisive battle reduced
by a quarter or a third—or indeed, if there are several fortresses, by half?

it be desired by the enemy or by our own commander—and where one is
not quite sure of victory to begin with, or where the terrain does not dictate
the choice of a battlefield farther forward, in such cases a nearby fortress
capable of resistance is a powerful argument for retiring behind it in order
to seek the decision behind it, and so gaining the benefit of its participation.
Besides, if we take up our position so close to the fortress that the enemy
can neither besiege nor invest it without driving us off, we will force him to
attack us in our position. We therefore think that no defensive measure in a
dangerous situation is so simple and as effective as the choice of a good
position close to and behind a substantial fortress.

the rear. One would then have to abandon much of one’s theater of
operations—a sacrifice that should only be made, as we have seen, if the
circumstances demand it. In that event, the measure comes close to being a
retreat into the interior of the country.

A fortress’s power of resistance is an additional factor. There are fortified

localities, large ones in particular, which should never be allowed to come
in contact with an enemy, since they are unequal to a strong attack by a
substantial force. In such a situation, our positions must at least be close
enough behind them to act as a support to the garrison.
  

6. Finally, withdrawal into the interior of the country is a proper course

only under the following circumstances:

a. When our physical and psychological situation vis-à-vis the enemy

rules out the possibility of successful resistance at or near the frontier

b. When our main objective is to gain time
c. When the condition of the country is favorable to it, as shown in

Chapter Twenty-Five above.

 
This ends the chapter on defense of a theater of war for cases in which a

decision is sought by one side or the other, and is therefore unavoidable.
But we must of course remind the reader that in real war things are never so
clear-cut. It follows that if one has a mind to apply our statements and
arguments to real war, one must also look to Chapter Thirty and note that
most generals will have to choose between the two courses, coming closer
to one or the other, according to circumstances.

CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE

Resistance

So far as mobile forces are concerned, this needs no detailed exposition.

But the theater of war considered as a fighting force itself, with all its
fortresses, its natural obstacles, and its sheer expanse of surface, is
immobile. It may thus either be activated in stages, or else we must
immediately retreat so far as to have all the participating components in our
front. In that case, every influence that an army’s theater of war can exert to
weaken the enemy will become effective. The enemy must invest your
fortresses, secure the area with garrisons and strongpoints, make lengthy
marches, procure supplies from far away, and so forth. He will experience
all these effects whether he advances before the decision or afterwards,
though they will be somewhat more damaging before than after. It follows
that if a defender decides early enough to shift the decision farther back in
time and space, he will find this to be a means for bringing all immobile
forces into play simultaneously.

It is clear, on the other hand, that, strictly speaking, this postponement of

the decision will have no effect on the sphere of influence that a victory
gives the attacker. This sphere of influence will be examined more closely
under the heading of “attack”; but we do want to point out that it will
extend to the point at which the superiority (the product of the physical and
psychological relation) is exhausted. This superiority is drained by two
factors: the demands made on the fighting forces by the theater of war
itself, and the losses sustained in battle. Neither of these is changed
substantially whether engagements are fought early or late, far forward or to
the rear. For example, we believe that in 1812 a victory over the Russians at

Vilna would have carried Bonaparte just as far as did the victory at
Borodino, provided it had the same dimensions; and that even a victory at
Moscow would not have carried him any further. Moscow was the limit of
his sphere of victory in any case. Indeed, there is not the slightest doubt that
a decisive battle at the frontier would (for different reasons) have produced
far greater results, and possibly a broader sphere of victory. This is therefore
a consideration that will have no effect on the defender’s shifting the point
of decision to the rear.

of withdrawal into the interior of the country, what can be considered the
ultimate form of postponing a decision. This particular form of resistance
aims at making the invader wear himself out rather than at defeating him in
battle. But a postponement of the decision can be considered as a special
form of resistance only where that is the primary objective; otherwise, an
infinite number of gradations in this method is obviously conceivable and
every one of them can be combined with every method of defense. The
degree of participation by the theater of war should, therefore, not be
considered as a special type of resistance, but merely as an optional
admixture of immobile means of resistance, to be used as needed, according
to the conditions and circumstances.

forces, or if the sacrifices involved are too arduous in other respects, these
forces remain on hand for a later stage. They can then be used like fresh
reinforcements for which the defender had not been able to wait previously,
and can become the means by which the mobile forces can follow up the
first decision with a second, and possibly even a third. In other words, in
this way a gradual application of strength becomes feasible.

provided it does not amount to a major defeat—that he may be able to
accept another to the rear of his next fortress. Indeed, a serious natural
obstacle alone may be enough to bring a not-too-resolute opponent to a halt.

In the utilization of a theater of war, as in everything else, strategy calls

for economy of strength. The less one can manage with, the better; but
manage one must, and here, as in commerce, there is more to it than mere
stinginess.

the amount of resistance rendered or attempted after a defeat is not what we
are discussing. What matters is the amount of success that can be expected
in advance from such renewed resistance—how much value the overall
plan should place on it. There is hardly more than one way in which a
defender should look at this: from the point of view of the enemy, of his
character and situation. If his character is weak, if he lacks self-confidence
and overriding ambition, and if his freedom of action is closely limited, he
will, if he is successful, be content with a modest advantage. Every new
chance for decision that the defense dares to offer, will make him hesitate
irresolutely. In that case, the defender can count on making the means of
resistance that his theater of operations offers felt gradually, in an
unremitting series of decisive actions, which, though individually of no
great consequence, will always hold out the possibility of turning these
decisions in his favor.

Surely it has become obvious by now that all this leads to the subject of

campaigns that reach no decision. These are the real arena for the gradual
use of strength, and will be discussed in the next chapter.

CHAPTER THIRTY

Decision Is Not the Objective

This is not the only type of campaign that lacks the necessary focus of

decision. History records numerous cases that do not lack for an aggressor
or a positive ambition on one side at least, but where this ambition is not
pronounced enough to be relentlessly pursued until it leads to the inevitable
decision. In such wars, the attacker seeks no advantages beyond those
offered by the circumstances at hand. Either he has set himself no objective
to pursue, and is merely harvesting the fruit that may ripen in the course of
time; or, if he has an objective, he has made the pursuit of it dependent on
favorable circumstances.

This type of attack, which ignores the strict logical necessity of pressing

on to the goal, is like an idler who strolls through a campaign and takes
advantage of the occasional bargain that comes his way. It does not differ
greatly from the defense that also allows its general to pick up a bargain,
but we shall reserve its more detailed scientific study for the book on attack.
At this time we will only state the conclusion, which is that in such a
campaign neither the offensive nor the defensive will keep the need for a
decision paramount. The decision in that case ceases to be the keystone of
the arch upon which all the lines of strategy converge.

The history of war, in every age and country, shows not only that most

campaigns are of this type, but that the majority is so overwhelming as to
make all other campaigns seem more like exceptions to the rule. Even if

this ratio changes in future, it is certain that there will always be a
substantial number of campaigns of this kind, and that aspect must have its
due in any doctrine of defending a theater of operations. We shall try to
indicate those attributes that appear to delimit it. In reality, most wars will
probably fall between the two poles, sometimes approaching one,
sometimes the other. The practical effect of these attributes becomes
evident only as a modification, caused by their contrary action, in the
absolute form of war.

We have argued in Chapter Three of this book that the state of waiting is

one of the greatest advantages the defense enjoys over the attack. It seldom
happens in real life, and even less often in war, that everything
circumstances would lead one to expect actually takes place. Because of the
limits of human insight, the dread that things might go wrong, and accidents
that change the course of action, many possible options are never chosen,
even though circumstances would have favored them. In war, where
imperfect intelligence, the threat of a catastrophe, and the number of
accidents are incomparably greater than in any other human endeavor, the
amount of missed opportunities, so to speak, is, therefore, also bound to be
greater. This is the fertile field in which the defender may glean a harvest he
did not sow. Add to this the intrinsic value represented by territory in the
conduct of war; what follows is a maxim that is also revered in the battles
of civilian life—litigation: beati sunt possidentes. This principle here takes
the place of the decision, which, in all wars directed toward mutual defeat,
is the focal point of the whole process. It is an uncommonly fertile principle
—not, of course, evoked in action, but in disclosures and motives for
inaction, as well as for the kind of activity that is meant to result in inaction.
Where no decision is intended or expected, there is no reason for
abandoning anything; that would be done only in order to purchase
advantages when the time for decision arrived. Consequently, the
defender’s aim is to hold on to—that is, to cover—as much as possible,
while the attacker will try to take as much as he can—that is, to spread his
forces as widely as possible—without provoking a decision. Only the
former concerns us here.

then the benefit of waiting is his. The defender will, therefore, attempt to

cover all territory directly, and then take a chance on the enemy’s
willingness to attack his covering forces.

of defense, we must anticipate the book on attack by listing the objectives
that an offensive usually pursues when no decision is intended. These are
the following:

1. Seizure of a considerable amount of territory, if this is possible without

a decisive engagement

2. Capture of an important supply depot, on the same conditions
3. Capture of a fortress left without cover (It is true that a siege is a fairly

serious business and can cost much effort; but it cannot lead to
disaster. If the worst comes to the worst, it can simply be abandoned,
without one’s suffering any real loss.)

4. Finally, victory in a moderately important engagement, in which not

much is risked and consequently not much can be gained; not an
engagement fraught with consequence, the climax of a whole strategic
plan, but one that is fought for its own sake only—for trophies or for
military glory. If that is its purpose, it will not, of course, be entered
into at any price: one either waits for any opportunity that may arise,
or attempts artificially to provide one.

 
These four objectives of the offensive now call forth the following efforts

on the defender’s part:

1. To cover his fortresses by keeping them in his rear
2. To cover the country by spreading out his forces
3. To interpose his forces quickly by means of flank marches wherever

his extension is not wide enough

4. To avoid, at the same time, any unfavorable engagements.
 
The first three aims are obviously intended to result in forcing the

initiative on the offensive, and to draw the utmost benefit from waiting. The
purpose is so rooted in the nature of the case that it would be foolish to
condemn it out of hand. The less a decision can be expected, the more valid
this objective will become. It is the governing principle in all such

campaigns, even though superficially there may appear to be a lot of brisk
activity, in the form of minor skirmishes which do not lead to decisive
consequences.

embraced this principle whenever they did not seek and did not expect a
decision. The fourth objective, which serves as a corrective to the other
three, is their conditio sine qua non.

We shall now discuss these matters in more detail.
To protect a fortress against enemy attack by positioning an army in front

of it may at first sight seem absurd and even superfluous when, after all,
fortresses are built for the purpose of resisting enemy attacks. Nevertheless,
we observe this measure occurring thousands of times. It is typical of the
conduct of war that the most common things in it often appear to be the
most incomprehensible. Who could muster enough courage, based on this
apparent contradiction, to declare that this oft-repeated measure was a
mistake every time it was employed? The ever-recurring form proves that
there must be some deep-seated reason for it. It is none other than that cited
above: sheer psychological inertia.

the fortress without first defeating our army. But a battle implies a decision.
If the enemy does not want one, he will not fight a battle; and we can hold
our fortress without striking a blow. Whenever we doubt that the enemy
seeks a decision, we must take a chance: the likelihood is that he will not do
so. And in most cases, one still has the possibility of withdrawing behind
the fortress if, contrary to expectations, the enemy does decide to attack.
This minimizes the dangers of taking a position in front of the fortress; the
practical certainty that the status quo can be maintained without sacrifice
will not entail even a remote degree of risk.

with an ideal target. Unless the fortress is very strong, and he is completely
unprepared, he will, for better or worse, start to lay siege to it; and in order
to prevent its falling into his hands, he will be obliged to relieve it. The
positive action, the initiative, is now up to us; the enemy, whose siege can
be considered as an advance toward his goal, is in possession. Experience
shows that matters always take this turn; they are bound to do so by their
very nature. As we have said, a siege does not have to end in disaster. The

feeblest, idlest, and least enterprising general who would never bring
himself to fight a battle, will cheerfully besiege a fortress just as soon as he
can reach it—even with nothing heavier than field-guns. At worst, he can
always give up the enterprise without suffering any real losses. To that
development must be added the danger to which most fortresses are more or
less exposed—that of being taken by storm or in some other unconventional
manner. These circumstances must not be overlooked when the defender
calculates the possibilities.

than choosing the advantage of fighting on better terms, would naturally
choose the virtual certainty of not having to fight at all. Seen in that light,
the practice of taking up position in front of a fortress becomes perfectly
natural and understandable. Frederick the Great observed it almost always
—at Glogau against the Russians, at Schweidnitz, Neisse, and Dresden
against the Austrians. At Breslau, on the other hand, it did not serve the
Duke of Bevern well: he could not have been attacked behind Breslau, the
Austrians had the upper hand so long as the King was absent, and they
knew that their superiority was unlikely to last once he came close. Thus,
the juncture at which the battle of Breslau took place was far from being
one at which no decision was to be expected—which makes the position
before Breslau less appropriate. The Duke of Bevern himself would surely
have preferred to take up a position on the far side of Breslau; but that
would have exposed the city and its supply depots to bombardment, and
would have earned him the severe displeasure of the King who, in cases of
this kind, could be quite small-minded. One cannot ultimately blame the
Duke for making an attempt at saving Breslau by taking an entrenched
position in front of it: it was entirely possible that it might have stopped
Prince Charles of Lorraine from making further advances, since he was
quite satisfied with his occupation of Schweidnitz, and was threatened by
the King’s approach. The best solution would have been to avoid
involvement in a battle and to withdraw through Breslau the moment the
Austrians advanced. The Duke would then have had all the benefits of
waiting without having to pay for them by taking risks.

We have now explained and justified the higher and overriding

arguments for a commander’s taking up his position in front of a fortress;
but we should say there is another, secondary reason for doing so—more

obvious, perhaps, but not valid in itself, for it is not of universal application.
It is the habit armies have of using the nearest fortress as a depot for their
supplies. That is so convenient, and so full of advantages, that a general will
not easily be persuaded to draw supplies from far away or to deposit them
in unprotected places. Where a fortress serves as a supply depot, it will in
many cases become absolutely necessary for an army to position itself
before the fortress, and in most cases it will be the natural thing to do. The
point is so obvious that those who are disinclined to look further are apt to
give it too much weight; but it cannot serve to explain every instance, nor
are its implications important enough to account for the final decision.

It is the normal objective of all attacks that do not aim at a major decision

to capture one or more fortresses without incurring the risk of a battle; so
much so that the prevention of that aim becomes a major item in the efforts
of the defense. That is why, in theaters of war where there are plenty of
fortresses, almost every movement turns on their possession. The attacker
tries to approach them unexpectedly, using various feints, while the
defender attempts to forestall this by means of well-planned movements.
That was characteristic of almost all campaigns in the Low Countries
between the days of Louis XIV and those of Marshal Saxe.

So much for the covering of fortresses.
Covering the country by spreading out our forces is conceivable only in

combination with major natural obstacles. The posts of various sizes that
have to be established can only acquire a certain capacity of resistance from
the strong positions they occupy; since natural obstacles are seldom
plentiful enough, the art of entrenchment must come to their assistance. It
should, however, be recalled that the strength produced by entrenchments at
any given point is only relative and should never be regarded as absolute.
(See the chapter on the significance of the engagement.) It may happen, of
course, that a post is able to ward off all attacks and thus achieve an
absolute defense; but out of all the numerous posts, each individual one
must be regarded as relatively weak in relation to the whole, and vulnerable
to possible assault by heavily superior forces. It would be unwise, therefore,
to base one’s confidence on the resistance that can be rendered by each
individual post. With this type of an extended position, one may expect a
fairly long resistance at best, but never a proper victory. Even so, the
individual post can serve its purpose and contribute to the general objective.

In campaigns where one need not be afraid of great decisions, of being
relentlessly driven toward disaster, not much risk will be involved if a post
becomes engaged in a skirmish, even if it ends in its loss. The stake is
seldom more than the post itself, plus a few trophies. It will not be a victory
of any consequence; it will not shatter foundations and bring down the
walls. At worst, if the whole defensive system was breached by the loss of a
single post, there would still be time for the defender to concentrate his
forces and, offer the enemy the decision that the latter, according to our
hypothesis, does not seek. Usually, such a concentration of forces puts an
end to the matter, and the attacker’s further advance is brought to a halt. A
little land, a few men, and some guns constitute the defender’s loss and the
attacker’s adequate gain.

To such a risk, if things go wrong, the defender may safely expose

himself if the risk is balanced by the possibility, or better yet the probability,
that it will not happen at all: timidity, or prudence—call it what you will—
may bring the attacker to a halt before the defender’s posts without his
battering his head against them. In advancing this argument, we must never
forget that it assumes an attacker who will not take great risks, who may
well be stopped by a moderate-sized but strong post. Even if he knows that
he can take it, he will still wonder at what price, and whether that price
might not be too high in relation to the use he can, in his present position,
make of his victory.

relative resistance afforded him by a position extending through a long line
of posts can make a worthwhile contribution to the sum of his campaign.
Reference to military history (to which the reader will turn at this point)
will show that such extended positions are most common in the latter part
of a campaign. By then the defender has learned to estimate the attacker’s
aims and potentialities for the current season, while the attacker, for his
part, will have lost what little enterprise he started out with.

Defense in an extended position that covers land, supplies, and

fortresses, must, of course, assign a principal role to all major natural
obstacles—streams and rivers, mountains, forests and marshes; they are of
paramount importance. Their use has been described in earlier chapters.

This paramount importance of topography makes special demands on the

Staff. Since that is the branch of the army that tends to write and publish the
most, these aspects of a campaign are the most fully documented. At the
same time there is a rather natural tendency to shape these into a system,
using the historical interpretation of a single case as the basis of a general
principle applicable to all cases. But that is futile and thus wrong. In this
more passive and more locally conditioned form of warfare, every case is
different and must be treated differently. Even the ablest critical memoirs on
these subjects are, therefore, suited only to present the facts, never to serve
as a precept. They really revert to being a military history, concerned with
only one particular aspect of the wars they describe.

general view of the matter, designated as its special province, are useful and
meritorious. However, we must sound a warning against abuses to which
they may be put, which frequently harm the enterprise as a whole. The
authority acquired by those leading members of the staff who are most
competent in military topography often gives them a kind of general
dominance over others, especially over the commander himself, which may
result in onesidedness. In the end, the commander-in-chief can see nothing
but mountains and passes; and in the place of rational decisions freely
arrived at, automatic responses will become second nature to him.

the very soul of the General Staff at the time, and a well-known specialist in
mountains and passes, managed to persuade two generals with entirely
different personal characteristics—the Duke of Brunswick and General
Möllendorf—to follow identical courses in their conduct of war.

obstacle may well lead to a cordon war. It would normally be bound to do
so if the full extent of the operational theater were really to be directly
covered in that manner, for, compared with the breadth of most of such
theaters, the natural tactical extension of the forces detailed to defend it is
extremely small. External circumstances as well as his own dispositions,
however, will limit the attacker to certain general routes and roads. If he
were to deviate from these excessively, he would run into too much trouble
and inconvenience, no matter how inactive the defender. Therefore, all the
latter needs to do is to cover the area for a certain number of miles or
marches to either side of the relevant main routes. To effect such cover, one

can simply set up defensive posts on the main roads and points of access;
observation posts will suffice for the area between them. Obviously an
enemy column may then pass between two posts and attack one or the other
of them from several directions. The posts, in turn, are somewhat prepared
for this eventuality, partly by having flank supports, partly by forming flank
defenses (so-called crochets), and partly by being able to obtain aid from
reserves in the rear or from units sent by an adjoining post. In this manner,
the number of posts is still further reduced, with the result that an army
engaged in this type of defense will be grouped into four or five main posts.

Special centers are set up for important points of access, which are

distant but may still be in danger. These form small operational zones, so to
speak, within the main theater of war. In the Seven Years War, for example,
the main Austrian army generally held four or five posts in the mountains of
Lower Silesia, while in upper Silesia a similar system of defense was
created by a small and partly independent force.

has to place additional reliance on mobility, active defense, and even
oftensive measures. Certain units will be held in reserve; one post will send
whatever troops it can spare to help another. This support can take the form
of coming up from the rear to stiffen a passive resistance and renew it, or of
attacking the enemy in flank or even threatening his retreat. If the enemy
threatens the flank of a post, not by a direct attack but by taking a position
from which he tries to interrupt the post’s communications, then either the
unit that creates the threat must be attacked, or one can retaliate with a
threat to the enemy’s communications.

essentially passive, must include a number of active means that will enable
it to deal with a wide variety of complex needs. Generally, a defense that
makes use of active, even offensive, means is considered superior.
However, that depends in part on the nature of the terrain, the composition
of the fighting forces, and even the general’s ability; also, one may be
expecting too much from mobility and other auxiliary measures of an active
nature, and too easily discount the local defensive capacity of a major
natural obstacle.

We believe we have sufficiently explained what we mean by an extended

line of defense, and now turn to the third of the remedies listed: forestalling

the enemy by a rapid lateral march.

This method is necessarily part of the mechanism of the type of defense

under discussion. In some instances, the defender cannot cover every
threatened point of access to the country, no matter how far he extends his
position. In many others he must be ready to lead the main strength of his
force to those posts that are the enemy’s objective, since they would
otherwise be too easily overcome. Finally, any general who dislikes tying
down his forces to passive defense in an extended position will only
achieve his purpose of protecting the country by a greater use of rapid
movements, well-conceived and well-executed. The wider the gaps left
uncovered, the greater must be the virtuosity of movement in order to
forestall the enemy everywhere in time.

that can be occupied in such eventualities, and are strong enough, once the
defender’s army, or even just a portion of it, has occupied them, to dispel
any thought of attack. These positions can be found everywhere and
everything depends on reaching them: they are therefore the keynote, so to
speak, of this kind of warfare. That, no doubt, is why it has been called war
of positions.

a great decision do not run the risks otherwise inherent in them, forestalling
an enemy by lateral marches is not so dangerous as it would be if great
decisions were involved. A hasty last-minute lateral push into a position,
against a determined, able, and purposeful enemy who will not hesitate to
expend considerable force, would be meeting disaster half-way: such a rush
and scramble into a position could never stand the test of a relentless
concentrated blow. It might well succeed, on the other hand, against an
enemy who hesitates to get his feet wet, who would not know how to use a
great success, or rather its preliminary stages, who seeks merely a limited
advantage and that at low cost. Against such an enemy, this type of
resistance may certainly be successfully employed.

second half of a campaign than in the first.

topography in working out a set of interlocking plans concerning the choice
and preparation of positions and the roads leading to them.

certain point and the other side’s efforts are equally bent on preventing it,
both will frequently be in the position of having to execute their movements
in full view of the enemy. Both will, therefore, move with greater caution
and precision than would normally be required. In former times, when the
main force was not split into independent parts but was treated as
indivisible even when on the march, such caution and precision called for
much more complicated movements, and therefore required a great deal of
artistry in tactics. Of course, single brigades sometimes had to race ahead of
the battle line and seize important points, thereby assuming an independent
role in which they were ready to make contact with the enemy even before
the main force had arrived. But these were and remained exceptions. In
general the order of march was always arranged to move the army as a
whole with its order undisturbed, and expedients of that kind were avoided
as much as possible. Today, the main force is once more divided into
independent units, which are permitted to engage the main enemy force,
provided the rest of the units are close enough to continue the engagement
and fight it to a finish. Such a lateral march is therefore much less difficult
today, even in full view of the enemy. What could formerly be
accomplished only by the mechanism of the order of march can now be
done by dispatching some divisions ahead of time, having others march
faster, and by the greater flexibility with which the whole can nowadays be
employed.

The defensive measures we have listed are designed to prevent an

attacker from taking a fortress, a valuable stretch of country, or a supply
depot. He is denied them when, by means of these measures, he encounters
engagements at every turn, which either offer too little prospect of success,
too great a risk of repercussions in case he loses, or, in general, too great an
expenditure of forces in proportion to his aims and situation.

If the defender perseveres, and his skill and dispositions meet with

success, the attacker will find even his limited purposes frustrated at every
turn by prudent preparations. At that point the offensive principle may often
attempt to vent itself by finding satisfaction for honor’s sake alone. Victory
in any engagement of some consequence will lend a semblance of
superiority. It satisfies the vanity of the general, the court, the army, and the

people, and thereby in some measure the expectations that are always
pinned on an offensive.

of some consequence, for the sake of the victory and the trophies alone. We
are not involving ourselves in a contradiction here, since we are still
proceeding on our own assumption that the defender, by his foresight, has
deprived the enemy of any hope of using a success to gain his real
objectives. Any such hope would turn on two requirements: first, a
favorable outcome, and second, that the victory actually lead on to the
further objectives.

the honors of the field are the enemy’s sole concern, the defender’s
individual posts and units will more often run the risk of having to fight at a
disadvantage than when he is out for additional gains.

is understandable that, when all he wanted were the trophies of the day, he
could take a chance on the assault at Hochkirch without stepping out of
character. A victory of consequence, on the other hand, which would have
forced the King to abandon Dresden and Neisse, would have been a
completely different task which he was not prepared to tackle.

with one of the most fundamental principles of war. In strategy, the
significance of an engagement is what really matters. We cannot repeat
often enough that all its essentials always derive from the ultimate
intentions of both parties, from the conclusion of the whole sequence of
ideas. That is why, strategically speaking, the difference between one battle
and another can be so great that the two can no longer be considered as the
same instrument.

will inflict serious damage on the defender; still, the latter will not be
willing to concede even that much advantage, especially since one can
never tell what else may by chance adhere to it. Therefore he will
constantly be concerned with surveying the condition of all his important
units and posts. That mainly depends on the sound actions of their own
commanders; but inappropriate orders on the part of the general himself can

also involve them in inevitable disaster. The fate of Fouqué’s corps at
Landeshut and of Finck’s at Maxen are cases that come to mind.

On both occasions Frederick the Great relied too much on the

effectiveness of traditional ways of thinking. He cannot really have believed
that 10,000 men in the position at Landeshut could be victorious over
30,000, or that Finck could hold against the overwhelming numbers that
poured in on him from all sides. He did assume that the strength of the
Landeshut position would go on being taken at face value, and that Daun
would find in the demonstration on his flank an adequate excuse for
exchanging a poor position in Saxony for a more convenient one in
Bohemia. He misjudged Laudon in one case and Daun for once in the other;
and in that lay the fault in his dispositions.

That type of error can happen even to commanders who are not too

proud, too bold and too obstinate, which Frederick the Great on occasion
certainly was. But here the real difficulty lies in the fact that a general
cannot always count on his corps commanders all having the sense and
good intentions, courage and strength of character that would ideally be
desirable. He is, therefore, not able to leave everything to their discretion,
but must give them directives, which will restrict their actions and may
easily render these inappropriate to the circumstances of the moment. That
is a completely unavoidable disadvantage. No army can be properly
commanded in the absence of a dominant, authoritarian determination that
permeates it down to the last man. Anyone who falls into the habit of
thinking and expecting the best of his subordinates at all times is, for that
reason alone, unsuited to command an army.

A sharp watch, therefore, must be kept on the condition of each corps and

post in order to prevent their becoming involved in unforeseen disaster.

All four of these efforts are intended to preserve the status quo. The more

successful and fortunate they are, the longer the war will remain static; but
the longer the war remains static, the more important the problem of
subsistence will become.

Very soon, if not from the start, exactions and requisitions will yield to a

system of supply from depots. Farm carts will no longer have to be
assembled every time, but a more or less regular transport pool will be set
up, either with local carts or military wagons. In short, the practice soon

approximates to the highly organized method of supplying food from depots
that we outlined in the chapter on maintenance and supply.

warfare, which by definition and character is confined to very limited areas.
It may be partly—and probably is to a large degree—determined by the
question of subsistence, but that will not alter its basic characteristics. On
the other hand, reciprocal threats to lines of communication will, for two
reasons, assume far greater importance: for one thing, since there are no
important and decisive means of action in this type of campaign, the
general’s efforts will have to be directed to such minor ones; for another,
there is plenty of time to wait for these measures to take effect.
Safeguarding one’s lines of communication therefore assumes substantial
importance. While their disruption will not be the final purpose of an enemy
attack, it can be a very effective means for forcing the defender to retreat,
and in the process abandon other points.

must, of course, also serve to cover the lines of communication. Their
safety is partly assured by these measures, and we simply wish to note that
concern for their safety will weigh heavily in the choice of position.

One particular method of protection is the escorting of individual

convoys by small bodies of troops, or even fairly large ones. Even the most
extended positions are at times not wide enough to safeguard lines of
communication; sometimes such an escort is especially desirable in places
where the general has been anxious to avoid an extended position. Hence,
Tempelhoff’s History of the Seven Years War abounds in cases in which
Frederick the Great provided his wagon train of bread and flour with escorts
—sometimes a single regiment of infantry or cavalry, sometimes a whole
brigade. There seems no record of the Austrians doing this, but possibly
that is because there was no such thorough historian as Tempelhoff on their
side, or because their positions were always a great deal more extended than
the Prussians’.

We have now examined all four types of endeavor that, without

containing an element of attack, can form the basis of a defense when no
decision is intended. At this point we must add a few words about the
offensive means with which they may be combined, or, so to speak, spiced.
They consist mainly of the following:

includes operations against his supply depots

2. Raids and diversions into enemy territory
3. Attacks on enemy posts and units, and even on his main force where

conditions are favorable—or simply the threat of such attacks.

 
In all campaigns of this kind, the first of these means is constantly at

work, but silently: it never comes to the fore. Any effective position
occupied by the defender derives its value, for the most part, from the fact
that it makes the attacker nervous about his own communications. The
problem of supply assumes a vital importance in this kind of warfare, as we
have already explained in the context of defense; and that holds for the
attacker as well. Consequently, the strategic pattern is largely determined by
the offensive value latent in the enemy’s positions, a topic that will be
further dealt with when we come to the subject of the attack.

Such a defense is not limited to the general effect produced by the choice

of positions, which, like the effect of pressure in mechanics, works
invisibly; it may also encompass a true offensive advance by part of the
fighting forces. But if it is to be successful, the location of the lines of
communication, the nature of the terrain, or the special qualities of the
troops must be especially favorable.

Raids into enemy territory made for the purpose of retribution or sacking

for the sake of booty cannot properly be counted as measures of defense:
rather, they are a means of attack. Normally however they can be combined
with the objective of an actual diversion aimed at reducing the strength of
the opposing side, and can therefore be called a truly defensive measure.
But since they can be used offensively just as well, and really are a form of
attack, the next book will be a more suitable place to discuss them in detail.
We mention raids here only to complete a list of the armory of minor
methods of offense, which the defender of an operational theater has at his
disposal, and merely wish to note that this is a method that may increase in
scope and importance until it gives the whole war the appearance, and along
with that the glory of an offensive. That was the nature of Frederick’s
activities in Poland, Bohemia, and Franconia prior to the campaign of 1759.
Though the campaign itself was obviously defensive, these forays into

enemy territory gave it the character of an offensive, which may have been
particularly important for its psychological impact.

a necessary complement to the defense as a whole, to be used at times when
the attacker takes things a little too easily and lays himself wide open at
some points. That is the tacit condition for this type of action. But here too,
as in his threats to the enemy’s lines of communication, the defender can
move closer to the attack by always being, like his enemy, on the alert for a
chance to strike a favorable blow. He can expect a measure of success in
this either if he has considerably larger numbers than his opponent—which,
though it may happen, is not really consistent with the nature of defense—
or if he is skillful and methodical enough to keep his forces better
concentrated than the enemy. Then he can use activity and movement to
offset the sacrifices that his situation forces on him.

the Great’s. Even so, Daun was usually found on the offensive only when
Frederick invited it by excessive boldness and contempt of his enemy, as at
Hochkirch, Maxen and Landeshut. Frederick, on the other hand, was almost
always on the move, aiming to strike at one or another of Daun’s corps with
his own main force. He succeeded only rarely, or at any rate with only
modest results, because Daun combined unusual caution and prudence with
his great superiority in numbers. Still, the King’s endeavors cannot be
considered to have been entirely in vain. They were in fact a most effective
form of resistance, for the care and trouble that Daun was driven to take in
order to avoid unfavorable engagements neutralized the strength that would
otherwise have contributed to a furthering of his offensive. One need only
point to the campaign of 1760 in Silesia where Daun and the Russians never
managed to advance a single step because they were so apprehensive that
the King might attack, now here, now there, and defeat them.

of an operational theater where no decision is intended constitute the
dominant ideas, the major efforts, and therefore the backbone of all action.
The main reason we brought them all together was to give a coherent view
of the articulation of the strategic operation; the particular ways in which
each component operates—marches, positions, and so forth—have been
previously examined in detail.

observe that where the offensive principle is so weak, the urge for a
decision so faint on both sides, the positive initiative so feeble, and the
psychological brakes so numerous as described here, the essential
difference between offensive and defensive must gradually disappear.
Admittedly, at the start of a campaign one side will invade the other’s
theater of war and assume the role of attacker; but it may well happen, and
often does, that the attacker soon finds himself expending all his energy
defending his own country on foreign soil. The two sides then confront each
other basically in a state of mutual observation: both are intent on not
giving up anything, and perhaps equally intent on achieving a positive gain.
Indeed it is possible, as in the case of Frederick the Great, that the actual
defender is more aggressive than his opponent.

The more the attacker relinquishes his active advance, the less the

defender feels threatened and the less he is narrowly confined to resistance
by the urgent need for safety, the more the situation will balance out on both
sides. The activity of each will be aimed at gaining an advantage from the
other, while avoiding any disadvantage to himself. This is a phase of true
strategic maneuver, and is certainly more or less characteristic of all
campaigns where a major decision is precluded by political motives or the
general state of affairs.

The subject of strategic maneuver will have a chapter to itself in the next

book. But since theorists have frequently ascribed false importance to this
balanced play of forces, particularly in the context of defense, we feel
obliged to discuss the subject here in some detail.

a state of balance exists; and where there is no great purpose to impel it, the
whole will not be in motion. That being so, both sides, no matter how
unequal, must be deemed to be in balance. Motives for minor actions and
lesser purposes are now able to emerge from the balanced state of the
whole. They can develop at this point, for they are no longer under the
strain of a great decision or great danger. Thus, whatever may be gained or
lost has been converted into smaller tokens, and the conflict as a whole has
splintered into minor actions. Given these minor contests for more modest
prizes, the two generals now engage in a test of skill. But since chance, or

luck, can never be kept completely out of war, this match will never cease
to be a gamble.

chance play a smaller part in shaping the decision than when everything is
concentrated into one great act? And will intelligence play a greater role?
The answer to this last question must be positive. The more complex the
whole, the more time (with its single moments) and space (with its single
points) enter into consideration, then the wider, obviously, will be the field
for calculation, and thus the greater the supremacy of the reasoning mind.
What reason gains will, in part, be lost to chance, but not necessarily
completely. It does not follow, therefore, that the first question need also be
answered affirmatively. We should remember in this connection that a
reasoning mind is not the general’s only mental asset. Courage, energy,
determination, prudence, and so forth are attributes that will weigh more
heavily where a single great decision is at stake. They will, therefore, count
somewhat less in a balanced play of forces, and the primary importance of
intelligent calculations increases at the expense of these qualities as well as
that of chance. At the hour of a great decision, on the other hand, these
brilliant qualities can deprive chance of a great deal of its dominance, and
so, in a way, secure some things that the reasoning mind had been forced to
release. Obviously, a number of factors are in conflict here, and one cannot
flatly say there is more room for chance in a great decision than in the final
score of a balanced play of forces. Therefore, when we suggest that the play
of forces is mainly a trial of skill, we mean skill in intelligent calculation
rather than in the whole range of military virtuosity.

This aspect of strategic maneuver has given it the exaggerated

importance that we mentioned above. For one thing, skill in this area has
been confused with the sum total of a general’s intellectual powers, which is
a serious mistake. We must repeat that, at times of great decision, a
general’s other psychological qualities may control the power of
circumstances. Even if this control stems from an impulse prompted by
strong emotions and from flashes of almost automatic intuition rather than
being the product of a lengthy chain of reasoning, it nonetheless genuinely
pertains to the art of war: after all, waging war is not merely an act of
reason, nor is reasoning its foremost activity. Second, there has been a
feeling that every unsuccessful action in a campaign was the result of skill

on the part of one or even both of the generals; actually, its normal and chief
basis lay in the prevalent conditions created by war for this kind of gamble.

of observing the enemy than of defeating him, it follows that strategic
maneuver is characteristic of most campaigns. Those in which no famous
general was engaged have been ignored; but when some great commander
was there to catch the eye, or where indeed there was one on each side as in
the case of Turenne and Montecuccoli, their names alone were enough to
give the final stamp of approval to the whole art of maneuver. The further
consequence has been that this game was rated the highest form of skill,
and a product of ultimate perfection. It has, therefore, been treated as the
prime source, and outstanding text, for the study of the art of war.

Wars of the French Revolution suddenly opened up a whole new world of
military manifestations. At first it was somewhat raw and primitive; later
Bonaparte crystallized it into a grandiose system that achieved successes
which amazed everyone. At that point, the old models were scrapped; it was
assumed that everything was the result of new discoveries, sublime ideas,
and so forth, and, indeed, the transformation of the social order. It seemed
that the old forms would serve no further use and would never return. But,
in such revolutions of thought, factions usually arise; and so the old school
found its champions who regarded the new phenomena as outbreaks of the
crudest violence, and as a general decay in the art of war. They are
convinced that the balanced, sterile, pointless game is the very zenith of
development. This is a view so lacking in logic and insight that it must be
considered a hopeless confusion of values. The opposite view, however—
that nothing of the kind would ever happen again—is also extremely ill-
advised. Very few of the new manifestations in war can be ascribed to new
inventions or new departures in ideas. They result mainly from the
transformation of society and new social conditions. But these, too, while
they are in the crisis of fermentation, should not be accepted as permanent.
There can therefore be little doubt that many previous ways of fighting will
reappear. This is not the time to go more fully into these matters. We are
content to have pointed out the place that this balanced play of forces holds
in the general conduct of war by means of its importance to, and intrinsic
relationship with, the elements concerned; and that it is always the result of

constrained circumstances and a greatly reduced military spirit on both
sides. It is possible for one general to show greater skill in this game than
the other. If he matches him in strength, he may thereby win some
advantages; if he is weaker, he may use his greater skill to hold the balance.
But it would be a real contradiction to seek a general’s highest honor and
glory in this area. On the contrary, campaigns of that sort are the surest sign
that neither general has great military gifts, or that the one who does is
prevented by circumstances from taking the risk of seeking a decision.
Where that is the case, however, one will never find the realm of highest
military glory.

deal with a particular effect that it has on operations: the fighting forces are
often diverted from the important roads and towns to remote or at any rate
unimportant areas. Where matters are determined by minor interests of a
temporary nature, the influence exerted on the conduct of war by major
topographical features will become less important. The fighting forces may
be shifted to places where the plain overall needs of the war would never
lead them; consequently, the course of war will take much greater twists
and turns in its details than in wars leading to a great decision. Take, for
instance, the last five campaigns of the Seven Years War: while the overall
circumstances remained unchanged, each campaign took a different course,
and, strictly speaking, no one operation was repeated; and this despite the
fact that the allies showed far more offensive spirit than they had in most
earlier campaigns.

The subject of this chapter has been the defense of an operational theater

when no great decision is in prospect, and the tendencies to be expected
from such an operation—their connection, relationship, and character.
Details of the relevant measures have been explored earlier. Now we come
to another question: whether a set of all-encompassing principles, rules, and
methods may be formulated for these various endeavors. Our reply must be
that history has certainly not guided us to any recurrent forms; nevertheless,
for a subject of such constantly changing nature one can hardly formulate a
theoretical law that is not based on experience. A war in which great
decisions are involved is not only simpler but also less inconsistent, more in
concert with its own nature, more objective, and more obedient to the law
of inherent necessity. In such a case, reason can make rules and laws, but in

the type of war we have been describing this seems far more difficult. Two
main principles for the conduct of major wars have evolved in our own
time: Bülow’s “breadth of a base” and Jomini’s “interior lines.” Even these,
when actually applied to the defense of an operational theater, have never
proved to be absolute and effective. Yet this is where, as purely formal
principles, they should be at their most effective: the more operations
expand in time and space, the more rules tend to increase in effectiveness
and dominate all other factors in the result. Nevertheless, they turn out to be
merely special aspects of the subject, and certainly anything but decisive
advantages. It is plain that circumstances exert an influence that cuts across
all general principles. The width and careful choice of positions achieved
by Daun found its counterpart in the King’s practice of closely
concentrating his main force, keeping it hard by the enemy and constantly
ready to improvise. Both methods are traceable not only to the nature of
their armies but also to the circumstances; it is easier for a king to
improvise than for a general who must answer for his acts. We must take
this opportunity to emphasize once more that a critic has no right to rank
the various styles and methods that emerge as if they were stages of
excellence, subordinating one to the other. They exist side by side, and their
use must be judged on its merits in each individual case.

derive from the characteristics of the army, the country, or the
circumstances; their general influence has been pointed out earlier.

We admit, in short, that in this chapter we cannot formulate any

principles, rules, or methods: history does not provide a basis for them. On
the contrary, at almost every turn one finds peculiar features that are often
incomprehensible, and sometimes astonishingly odd. Nevertheless it is
useful to study history in connection with this subject, as with others. While
there may be no system, and no mechanical way of recognizing the truth,
truth does exist. To recognize it one generally needs seasoned judgment and
an instinct born of long experience. While history may yield no formula, it
does provide an exercise for judgment here as everywhere else.

We have but a single comprehensive principle to offer; or rather, we shall

express the natural assumption underlying all we have said in the form of an
independent principle, so as to increase its impact on the reader’s mind.

certain limitations on both sides. Beyond this sphere, a different set of rules
applies, in a totally different universe of phenomena. A general must never
forget this; he must never expect to move on the narrow ground of illusory
security as if it were absolute; he must never permit himself to feel that the
means he is using are absolutely necessary and the only ones possible, and
persist in using them even though he may shudder at the thought of their
possible inadequacy.

mistake impossible; but that is not the case in practice, where matters are
not so sharply delineated.

distinction, and emphasis to our ideas, only perfect contrasts, the extremes
of the spectrum, have been included in our observations. As an actual
occurrence, war generally falls somewhere in between, and is influenced by
these extremes only to the extent to which it approaches them.

Broadly speaking, then, it is crucial that the general decide from the start

whether his opponent is both willing and able to outdo him by using
stronger, more decisive measures. If this is what he suspects, he must
abandon the minor measures he had employed in order to escape minor
disadvantages. Then he may avail himself, through a voluntary sacrifice, of
the means of achieving a better position, and will thus be able to cope with
a weightier decision. In other words, the first requirement is that the general
apply the right standard of measurement in his plan of operations.

This will be made clearer by examples from real life. We shall briefly cite

a number of cases of misguided judgments—cases, in our opinion, where a
general’s operations had been calculated to suit a much less decisive action
on the part of his opponent. Let us begin with the opening of the campaign
of 1757. The disposition of the Austrian forces proved that they had not
expected an offensive as thoroughgoing as the attack that Frederick actually
launched. Even the delay of Piccolomini’s corps on the Silesian frontier
while Duke Charles of Lorraine, with his army, was in danger of having to
surrender, shows a similar total misunderstanding of the circumstances.

of the Convention of Kloster-Zeven (which has no place in the present
discussion), but two months later they were also quite wrong in their

estimate of the enemy’s capabilities—and therefore lost the whole area
between the Weser and the Rhine. We have already mentioned the
miscalculations of Frederick the Great in 1759 at Maxen and in 1760 at
Landeshut, where he did not expect his enemies to take decisive measures.

than that applied in 1792. It was expected that a moderate auxiliary corps
would be enough to end a civil war; but the colossal weight of the whole
French people, unhinged by political fanaticism, came crashing down on us.
We call this a serious error because later on it proved to be one; not because
the error would have been easy to avoid at the time. In terms of actual
operations it is undeniable that the chief basis for all the subsequent
calamitous years can be found in the campaign of 1794. Not only did the
allies, in the campaign itself, completely fail to recognize the powerful
nature of the enemy offensive, trying to counter it with a paltry system of
extended positions and strategic maneuver, but it is evident from the
political squabbles between Prussia and Austria, and the foolish
abandonment of Belgium and the Netherlands, that the governments
involved had no idea of the fury of the oncoming torrent. The Austrians’
isolated efforts at resistance in 1796, at Montenotte, Lodi, and so forth, are
sufficient proof that they failed to understand what really mattered in a war
against Bonaparte.

In 1800 it was not the direct effect of the offensive that brought disaster

on Melas, but his erroneous estimate of the results of that assault.

feeble strategic schemes, would have sufficed to catch a Daun or a Lacy,
but it was not strong enough for Bonaparte, Emperor of the Revolution.

by outdated, petty and impracticable views and schemes, which were
combined with a few lucid ideas and a sense of the outstanding importance
of the moment. If they had been fully conscious and aware of their
situation, they would not have kept 30,000 men in Prussia and planned
separate operations in Westphalia, nor would they have hoped for any result
whatsoever from minor offensives such as those to which Rüchel’s and the
Weimar corps were detailed. They certainly would not have spent their last
moments debating threats to supply depots and the possible forfeiture of a
few small tracts of land.

without its share of projects based on miscalculation. At headquarters in
Vilna, a group of respected officers were determined to fight a battle on the
frontier, in order to show that Russian soil could not be violated with
impunity. They were well aware that such a battle might be—indeed would
be—lost; even though they did not know that 80,000 Russians would be
faced with 300,000 Frenchmen, they realized that they would have to
expect a great superiority of numbers. Their chief error lay in their estimate
of the battle. They believed it would be a defeat like any other, but one can
be practically certain that such an important decision on the frontier would
have brought about a completely different series of repercussions. Even the
camp at Drissa was a measure that was still based on a totally erroneous
estimate of the enemy. If the Russian army had intended to stay there, it
would have been cut off and completely isolated, and the French army
would not have lacked the means of forcing it to surrender. The man who
designed that camp surely had not reckoned with such dimensions of power
and determination.

But Bonaparte, too, occasionally applied the wrong standard of

measurement. After the armistice of 1813 he believed he could contain the
smaller allied armies—Blücher’s and the Crown Prince of Sweden’s—by
using corps that were not able to put up serious resistance. To a cautious
opponent, they might have provided an excuse for not incurring risks,
which had often happened in earlier wars. He did not take enough account
of the deep-seated hatred and the sense of imminent danger that animated
Blücher and Bülow.

In general, Napoleon always tended to underestimate old Blücher’s

enterprising spirit. It was Blücher alone who deprived him of victory at
Leipzig. At Laon, Blücher could have destroyed him completely, and the
fact that he did not had nothing to do with Bonaparte’s own calculations.
The penalty for his past mistakes finally caught up with him when lightning
struck at Belle Alliance.

BOOK SEVEN

In dealing with attack, we shall largely have to treat topics that have

already been discussed. But we do not think we need proceed, as do so
many textbooks in engineering, by circumventing or demolishing all the
positive values we identified in defense and proving that for every method
of defense there is an infallible method of attack. Defense has its strengths
and weaknesses. Though the former may not be insurmountable, the cost of
surmounting them may be disproportionate. This must hold true whatever
way we look at it; otherwise we are contradicting ourselves. Nor do we
intend to analyze this interaction exhaustively. Every method of defense
leads to a method of attack, but this is often so obvious that we do not need
to discuss both in order to perceive it: one follows automatically from the
other. We intend to indicate in each case the special features of attack that

do not arise directly from the defense. This is bound to call for a number of
chapters that have no counterpart in the previous book.

The act of attack, particularly in strategy, is thus a constant alternation

and combination of attack and defense. The latter, however, should not be
regarded as a useful preliminary to the attack or an intensification of it, and
so an active principle; rather it is simply a necessary evil, an impeding
burden created by the sheer weight of the mass. It is its original sin, its
mortal disease.

We call it an impeding burden: unless defense contributes to the attack, it

will tend to diminish its effect, if only because of the loss of time involved.
Is it possible for this defensive component, which is part of every offensive,
to be actually disadvantageous? When we assume attack to be the weaker
and defense the stronger form of war, it seems to follow that the latter
cannot be detrimental to the former: if there are enough forces to serve the
weaker form, they must surely suffice for the stronger. That is generally so.

We shall examine the subject more closely in the chapter on the culminating
point of victory. However, we must not forget that the superiority of
strategic defense arises partly from the fact that the attack itself cannot exist
without some measure of defense—and defense of a much less effective
kind. What was true of defense as a whole no longer holds true for these
parts, and it thus becomes clear how these features of defense may
positively weaken the attack. It is these very moments of weak defense
during an offensive that the positive activity of the offensive principle in
defense seeks to exploit.

Consider the difference of the situations during the twelve-hour rest

period that customarily follows a day’s action. The defender holds a well-
chosen position which he knows and has prepared with care; the attacker
has stumbled into his bivouac like a blind man. A longer halt, such as may
be required to obtain supplies, await reinforcements, and so forth, will find
the defender close to his fortresses and depots, while the attacker is like a
bird perched on a limb. Every attack will anyhow end in a defense whose
nature will be decided by the circumstances. These may be very favorable
when the enemy forces have been destroyed, but where this is not the case
things may be very difficult. Even though this type of defense is no longer
part of the offensive, it must affect it and help determine its effectiveness.

necessarily inherent in it, in order clearly to understand its disadvantages
and to anticipate them.

defense has its stages, insofar as the principle of waiting is exploited. From
these, essentially different forms of action will result, as has been discussed
in the chapter on kinds of resistance.

But since attack has but one single active principle (defense in this case

being merely a dead weight that clings to it) one will find in it no such
differentiations. Admittedly there are tremendous differences in terms of
vigor, speed, and striking power, but these are differences of degree, not of
kind. It even might be conceivable for the attacker to choose the defensive
form to further his aims. He might, for instance, occupy a strong position in
the hope that the defender would attack him there. But such cases are so
rare that in the light of actual practice they do not require consideration in

our listing of concepts and principles. To sum up: there is no growth of
intensity in an attack comparable to that of the various types of defense.

forces—to which one must of course add any fortresses located close to the
theater of war, which may have a substantial influence on the attack. But
this influence will weaken as the advance proceeds; clearly, the attacker’s
fortresses can never play so prominent a part as the defender’s, which often
become a main feature. Popular support of the attack is conceivable where
the inhabitants are more favorably inclined toward the attacker than toward
their own army. Finally, the attacker may have allies, but only as a result of
special or fortuitous circumstances. Their support is not inherent in the
nature of the attack. Thus, while we have included fortresses, popular
uprisings and allies among the possible means of defense, we cannot
include them among the means of attack. In the first they are inherent, in
the second they are rare and then usually accidental.

The object of strategic attack, therefore, may be thought of in numerous

gradations, from the conquest of a whole country to that of an insignificant
hamlet. As soon as the objective has been attained the attack ends and the
defense takes over. One might therefore think of a strategic attack as an
entity with well-defined limits. But practice—seeing things, that is, in the
light of actual events—does not bear this out. In practice the stages of the
offensive—that is, the intentions and the actions taken—as often turn into
defensive action as defensive plans grow into the offensive. It is rare, or at
any rate uncommon, for a general to set out with a firm objective in mind;
rather, he will make it dependent on the course of events. Frequently his
attack may lead him further than he expected; after a more or less brief
period of rest he often acquires new strength; but this should not be
considered as a second, wholly separate action. At other times he may be
stopped earlier than he had anticipated, but without abandoning his plan and
moving over to a genuine defensive. So it becomes clear that if a successful
defense can imperceptibly turn into attack, the same can happen in reverse.
These gradations must be kept in mind if we wish to avoid a misapplication
of our general statements on the subject of attack.

Overall strength is depleted:

1. If the object of the attack is to occupy the enemy’s country

(Occupation normally begins only after the first decisive action, but
the attack does not cease with this action.)

2. By the invading armies’ need to occupy the area in their rear so as to

secure their lines of communication and exploit its resources

3. By losses incurred in action and through sickness
4. By the distance from the source of replacements
5. By sieges and the investment of fortresses
6. By a relaxation of effort
7. By the defection of allies.
 
But these difficulties may be balanced by other factors that tend to

strengthen the attack. Yet it is clear that the overall result will be determined
only after these various quantities have been evaluated. For instance, a
weakening of the attack may be partially or completely cancelled out or
outweighed by a weakening of the defense. This is unusual; in any case one
should never compare all the forces in the field, but only those facing each
other at the front or at decisive points. Different examples: the French in
Austria and Prussia, and in Russia; the allies in France; the French in Spain.

What matters therefore is to detect the culminating point with

discriminative judgment. We here come up against an apparent
contradiction. If defense is more effective than attack, one would think that
the latter could never lead too far; if the less effective form is strong enough
the more effective form should be even stronger.109

mean? At what price?

Different points of view that are possible:

1. To destroy only what is needed to achieve the object of the attack
2. To destroy as much as possible
3. The preservation of one’s own fighting forces as the dominant

consideration

4. This can go so far that the attacker will attempt destructive action only

under favorable circumstances, which may also apply to the
achievement of the objective, as has been mentioned in Chapter Three.

 
The engagement is the only means of destroying the enemy’s forces, but

it may act in two different ways, either directly or indirectly, by a
combination of engagements. Thus while a battle is the principal means, it
is not the only one. The capture of a fortress or a strip of territory also
amounts to a destruction of enemy forces. It may lead to further destruction,
and thereby become an indirect means as well.

So the occupation of an undefended strip of territory may, aside from its

direct value in achieving an aim, also have value in terms of destruction of
enemy forces. Maneuvering the enemy out of an area he has occupied is not
very different from this, and should be considered in the same light, rather
than as a true success of arms. These means are generally overrated; they
seldom achieve so much as a battle, and involve the risk of drawbacks that
may have been overlooked. They are tempting because they cost so little.

They should always be looked upon as minor investments that can only

yield minor dividends, appropriate to limited circumstances and weaker

motives. But they are obviously preferable to pointless battles—victories
that cannot be fully exploited.

We were thinking of the kind of battle in which the defensive is most

prominent, in order to clarify the nature of the defensive. But very few
battles are of that type; most of them are in part encounters (demi-
rencontres) in which the defensive element tends to get lost. This is not so
with the offensive battle, which retains its character under all
circumstances, and can assert it all the more since the defender is not in his
proper element. So there remains a certain difference in the character of the
battle—the way in which it is conducted by one side or the other—between
those battles that are not really defensive and those that are true encounters
(rencontres). The main feature of an offensive battle is the outflanking or
by-passing of the defender—that is, taking the initiative.

Enveloping actions obviously possess great advantages; they are,

however, a matter of tactics. The attacker should not forego these
advantages simply because the defender has a means of countering them; it
is a means the attacker cannot use, for it is too much bound up with the rest
of the defender’s situation. A defender, in order to outflank an enemy who
is trying to outflank him, must be operating from a well-chosen, well-
prepared position. Even more important is the fact that the defender cannot
actually use the full potential offered by his situation. In most cases, defense
is a sorry, makeshift affair; the defender is usually in a tight and dangerous
spot in which, because he expects the worst, he meets the attack half-way.
Consequently, battles that make use of enveloping lines or reversed fronts—
which ought to be the result of advantageous lines of communication—tend
in reality to be the result of moral and physical superiority. For examples,
see Marengo, Austerlitz, and Jena. And in the opening battle of a campaign
the attacker’s base-line, even if it is not superior to the defender’s, will

usually be very wide, because the frontier is so close, and he can thus afford
to take risks. Incidentally a Hank-attack—that is, a battle in which the front
has been shifted—is more effective than an enveloping one. It is a mistake
to assume that an enveloping strategic advance must be linked with it from
the start, as it was at Prague. They seldom have anything in common, and
the latter is a very precarious business about which we shall have more to
say when we discuss the attack on a theater of operations. Just as the
commander’s aim in a defensive battle is to postpone the decision as long as
possible in order to gain time (because a defensive battle that remains
undecided at sunset can usually be considered a battle won), the aim of the
commander in an offensive battle is to expedite the decision. Too much
haste, on the other hand, leads to the risk of wasting one’s forces. A
peculiarity in most offensive battles is doubt about the enemy’s position;
they are characterized by groping in the dark—as, for example, at
Austerlitz, Wagram, Hohenlinden, Jena, and Katzbach. The more this is so,
the more it becomes necessary to concentrate one’s forces, and to outflank
rather than envelop the enemy. In Chapter Twelve of Book Four it has been
demonstrated that the real fruits of victory are won only in pursuit. By its
very nature, pursuit tends to be a more integral part of the action in an
offensive battle than in a defensive one.

inconvenience to the attacker. Having crossed it he is usually limited to a
single bridge, so unless he stays close to the river his actions will be
severely hampered. Worse, if he intends to offer a decisive battle on the far
side, or if he expects the enemy to attack him, he will expose himself to
grave danger. So no general will place himself in such a position unless he
can count on substantial moral and material superiority.

2. The very difficulty involved in taking up a position beyond a river also

greatly increases the possibility of its effective defense. Assuming that this
defense is not regarded as the only resource available, but is planned so that
even if it fails a stand along the river remains possible, the resistance that
the attacker will meet from the defender of the river must be added to all the
advantages listed under no. 1. Taken together, all this explains the respect in
which an attack on a defended river is held by most generals.

the defense of the river itself promises good results. We must admit that in
practice these successes occur even more frequently than theory would lead
one to expect. Theory takes into account only a set of known circumstances,
but in practice these will appear more difficult to the attacker than they
really are, and so will serve as a powerful brake on his actions.

If the attack under discussion is not aimed at an important decision and is

made without dash or determination, the attacker is bound in carrying it out
to meet a number of awkward little obstacles and accidents, things no
theorist ever took into account, which will be to his disadvantage simply
because he is taking the initiative and they therefore happen to him first. Let
us only think how often the streams of Lombardy, insignificant in
themselves, have been successfully defended. If military history also shows
cases in which the defense of rivers failed to fulfill expectations, this is

merely evidence that sometimes too much has been expected that was based
not on tactical possibilities but on the lessons of past experience stretched
beyond their limits.

the attacker only if the defender makes the mistake of staking his whole
future on this defense. If the crossing is forced after all, he runs into grave
difficulties and risks catastrophe; it is easier to force a river-crossing than to
win an ordinary battle.

5. It follows that the defense of a river can be really useful where a great

decision is not sought; but if, because of the superiority and vigor of the
enemy, such a decision can reasonably be expected, a miscalculated river
defense can be of positive value to the attacker.

along the whole of their length or at some particular point. If the attacker is
stronger and eager to strike a major blow, he can make a diversion at one
point while he crosses at another. He can then make up for any setbacks in
the early stages of the engagement by using his superior strength to press
ahead ruthlessly. Rarely if ever is a river crossing actually forced by tactical
means—by driving off one of the main defensive posts by superior
firepower and superior valor. “Forcing a passage” is a phrase to be
interpreted in the strategic sense alone: the attacker, by crossing at an
undefended or only lightly defended point, still faces all the dangers that the
crossing should, from the defender’s point of view, bring down on him. But
the worst thing an attacker can do is to cross simultaneously at several
points, unless these are so close together as to afford mutual support. The
defender has to disperse his strength, but if the attacker does the same he
throws away a natural advantage. That is how Bellegarde lost the battle on
the Mincio in 1814: both armies happened to be crossing simultaneously at
different points, but the Austrians were more widely separated than the
French.

there are obviously two ways of obtaining a strategic advantage. The first is
to cross anywhere regardless of his presence, and thus turn the tables on
him. The second is to fight a battle. The main determinant in the first case
should be the relationship between the base and the lines of communication,
though the particular circumstances are often more decisive than the general

situation. This can to some extent be ignored by the army that has chosen
better sites for its posts, made better tactical dispositions, commands greater
discipline, or can march faster. As for the other course, one must assume
that the attacker has the means, the right conditions and the determination to
fight a battle. If that is so, the defender will not lightly run the risk of this
kind of river defense.

present major difficulties; but, unless a great decision is involved, there will
be enough misgivings about their consequences and their further
implications for them easily to bring the attacker to a halt. He will either
leave the defender on the near side of the river or, at most, cross the river
but stay close to it. It is rare for two armies to face one another across a
river for any length of time.

But even when a great decision is involved, a river is a substantial factor,

for it always weakens and dislocates the offensive. In such a case, one can
only hope that the defender will make the mistake of treating the river as a
tactical obstacle and making its direct defense the central point of his
resistance, thus handing the attacker the advantage of dealing him the
decisive blow with a minimum of effort. It must be understood that this
blow will not bring about the enemy’s complete collapse immediately, but
will lead to a series of successful engagements that will gradually create
severely unfavorable general conditions, as was the case with the Austrians
on the lower Rhine in 1796.

But our topic should not be confused with ordinary battles. Most battles

are true clashes (rencontres) in which one side is admittedly on the
defensive but not in entrenched positions.

By their very nature, entrenched camps are thinly manned; but if the

natural obstacles are favorable and the entrenchments well constructed, they
can be held against heavily superior numbers. Frederick the Great thought
that an attack on the camp at Pirna would not be feasible, even though his
strength was twice the garrison’s. Since then it has sometimes been alleged
that the camp would not have been too hard to take; but the only proof for
this view is based on the extremely poor condition of the Saxon garrison,
which is of course no argument against the value of the entrenchments. But

attack on an entrenched camp. Such an attack is advisable only if the
defenses have been executed hurriedly, left incomplete and lack obstacles to
access; or in general if, as often happens, the camp is a mere sketch of what
it ought to be—a half-completed ruin. Then an attack may be advisable and
an easy way to vanquish the enemy.

An offensive endowed with the means and the resolve to fight a battle

will meet the enemy in the mountains and will certainly profit by doing so.

But here again we have to repeat that it will be difficult to gain

acceptance for this conclusion because it goes against all appearances and,
at first sight, against all experience. In most cases it still holds true that an
army on the offensive, whether or not it is bent on a decisive battle, would
consider itself extraordinarily lucky to find that the enemy had not occupied
a mountain range between them. It would hurry to get there first, and no
one would regard this as contradictory to the nature of the offensive. We
agree; but it is necessary to make more precise distinctions.

An army advancing upon an enemy with the intention of fighting a

decisive battle will, if it has to cross an unoccupied mountan range,
naturally be concerned lest the enemy might at the last moment block the
very passes it intended to use. In that case the attacker could not enjoy the
advantages that would have been his if the enemy had occupied an ordinary
mountain position. The enemy is now no longer overextended; he is no
longer in doubt about the route the attacker is taking; and the latter has not

been able to choose his roads with the enemy’s position in mind. So this
battle in the mountains does not confer all the advantages on the attacker we
have described in Book Six. Under these circumstances it is possible to
regard the defender as being in an unassailable position. So the defender
may after all command the means of turning the mountains to his own
advantage in a decisive battle. This may indeed be possible; but when one
considers the difficulties of taking up a favorable mountain position at the
last moment, especially if it has previously been left completely
unoccupied, one will realize that this is a totally unreliable method of
defense. So the circumstances that the attacker has reason to dread are most
unlikely to occur. Yet even though they are unlikely, it remains natural to
fear them: in war it is often the case that a particular concern is entirely
natural even if somewhat unnecessary.

mountains by an advance guard or a chain of posts. While this measure too
will very seldom be to the defender’s interest, the attacker is not in a
position to distinguish whether or not this is likely to happen, and he will
therefore fear the worst.

the mountainous nature of the ground may make a position really
unassailable. Such positions do exist, though they do not have to be in
mountain country: Pirna, Schmottseifen, Meissen and Feldkirch are
examples. These are all the more useful because they are not in mountains.
Still, it is conceivable that they may be found in mountains—on high
plateaus, for instance, where the defender is able to avoid the ordinary
drawbacks of a mountainous position. But they are exceptions, and we must
address ourselves to the majority of cases.

defensive battles. Great commanders bent on such a battle usually preferred
to take up a position on open ground. There is not a single example in the
history of war of a decisive engagement in the mountains, with the
exception of the Revolutionary Wars. There, apparently a mistaken
application and analogy led to the use of mountain positions even where
decisive engagements could be expected, as in the Vosges in 1793 and
1794, and in Italy in 1795, 1796, and 1797. Mélas has been widely
criticized for not having occupied the Alpine passes in 1800, but that is a

rash criticism—one could call it a rather immature and superficial
judgment. Bonaparte, in Mélas’ place, would not have occupied them
either.

Preparations for attacking a mountain position are mostly tactical.

However, we ought to list the following as a preliminary outline, applicable
to the parts closest to strategy and coinciding with it.

diverge from the road and split one column into two or three as the needs of
the moment may require. Usually everything comes to a halt in long defiles.
The advance, therefore, should proceed on several roads from the start or,
better still, be made on a somewhat broader front.

2. When attacking a widely extended line of defense in mountains, one

will of course do so with a concentrated force; the whole position cannot
possibly be outflanked. If one is aiming at a major victory it will have to be
accomplished by piercing the enemy’s lines and forcing his wings apart,
rather than by surrounding the force and cutting it off. The attacker’s natural
intention will then be a rapid irresistible advance along the enemy’s main
line of retreat.

3. If, however, the enemy has to be attacked in a more concentrated

mountain position,111 flanking operations will form a major part of the plan,
since frontal attacks will meet with maximum opposition; but they must be
aimed more at actually cutting off the enemy forces than at tactical assaults
in flank or rear, for even the rear of a mountain position can offer strong
resistance if the forces are available. The fastest way of getting results is
always to give the enemy reason to fear having his line of retreat cut. That
fear is aroused more quickly and effectively in mountain warfare, for there
it is not so easy to cut one’s way out if worst comes to worst. But for the
offensive a simple demonstration will not be enough: at best it might
maneuver the enemy out of his position, but it would not yield a definite
result. One must therefore aim at really cutting him off.

The lines of circumvallation of a besieging force will have their own

peculiar character, which I intend to discuss in the chapter on the attack on a
theater of operations.

It is a peculiarity of all cordon-like positions, such as reinforced outpost-

lines and so forth,112 that they are easily pierced; but where this is done
without the intention of pressing on and obtaining a decision, it will result
only in a minor success, which usually is not worth the effort expended on
it.

Thirty of Book Six. While the device is common to attacker and defender,
its nature is more closely related to attack than to defense, and we shall now
therefore define it more closely.

2. Maneuver must be distinguished, not only from aggressive conduct of

the attack by means of major engagements, but from everv operation that
arises immediately out of such an attack; whether it be a diversion, pressure
on the enemy’s lines of communication or on his retreat, and so forth.

3. In its ordinary meaning the term maneuver carries the idea of an effect

created out of nothing, so to speak—that is to say, out of a state of
equilibrium —by using the mistakes into which the enemy can be lured. It
can be compared to the opening gambits in a game of chess. It is, in fact, a
play of balanced forces whose aim is to bring about favorable conditions for
success and then to use them to gain an advantage over the enemy.

frame of reference for our actions, are the following:

a. The enemy’s food supplies, which one aims to cut off or reduce
b. A combination with other units
c. A threat to other communications with the interior of the country or

with other armies or detachments

d. A threat to the retreat
e. An attack on individual points with superior forces.
 
These five factors can be found in the smallest detail of the particular

situation, which then becomes the object around which, for a time,
everything revolves. It may be a bridge, a highway or an entrenchment; but

in every case it would be easy to show that its importance is derived
entirely from its relation to one of the factors named above.

f. For the attacker, or rather for the active party (who admittedly may be

the defender) the outcome of a successful maneuver will consist of a
strip of land, supply depot, or the like.

g. A strategic maneuver comprises two pairs of opposites, which appear

distinct and may well have been used for formulating misleading rules
and maxims. In fact their four elements are all basically essential parts
of one whole and must be considered as such. The first pair of
opposites consists of outflanking the enemy or of operating on interior
lines; the second, of concentrating one’s forces or of extending them
over numerous posts.

h. Concerning the first pair of opposites, one cannot possibly say that one

of the two elements is generally superior to the other. The reason is
partly that an attempt at one will naturally evoke the other as the
obvious countermove, the proper antidote; and partly because
envelopment is associated with attack, whereas the use of interior lines
is associated with defense: so that, broadly speaking, the former suits
the attack, and the latter the defense. The superior form is that which is
best carried out.

i. It is just as impossible to rank the elements of the other pair of

opposites. A stronger force can afford to extend itself. It will thus, in
many respects, establish a convenient strategic posture and spare the
troops unnecessary effort. The weaker side must remain more closely
concentrated and make up for the resulting disadvantages by mobility.
This greater mobility assumes a greater degree of competence in
marching. The weaker side, therefore, must exert itself more, both
physically and morally. That is the inevitable conclusion, of course, if
our argument has been consistent; in fact, it can virtually be regarded
as its appropriate test. The campaigns of Frederick the Great against
Daun in 1759 and 1760, and Laudon in 1761, and of Montecuccoli
against Turenne in 1673 and 1675 have always been considered as the
most brilliant examples of this form, and our opinions are largely
based on them.

opposites for formulating misleading rules and maxims, one should be
on the alert against attributing more importance and decisive influence
than they possess to such other general circumstances as baseline,
terrain, and so forth. The smaller the importance of the stake, the
greater the importance of the details of the momentary situation; wider
and more general factors fade into the background, being in a way too
large in scale for the matter in hand. Could there, broadly speaking, be
a more preposterous situation than that of Turenne in 1675? He stood
with his back close to the Rhine, extended over fifteen miles, the
bridge for his retreat being at his extreme right wing. All the same, his
dispositions worked, and they have rightly been held to show a high
degree of skill and judgment. But this degree of success and skill can
only be fully understood when one pays attention to the details, and
appreciates them according to their value in each individual case.

no method or general principle can determine the value of the action; rather,
superior application, precision, order, discipline, and fear will find the
means to achieve palpable advantage in the most singular and minute
circumstances. It is on these qualities that victory in this type of contest
largely depends.

there could have been no further question of forcing the final line of
inundation.

French made clear in 1794-1795; but it has to be a hard winter.

as we have said. If they are not too thick the attacker can traverse them by
several neighboring roads and reach a more favorable area. The tactical
strength of the individual positions will not be great, because a forest can
never be considered impassable in the same way as a swamp or a river. In
Russia and Poland, on the other hand, vast tracts of land are almost
completely covered by forests; if an attacker is not strong enough to get to
the far side, he will be in a most difficult situation. One only has to
remember the problems of supply with which he has to contend. What is
more, in the depth of the forest he will hardly be in a position to impress the
omnipresent enemy with the superior weight of his numbers. This is
without doubt one of the worst situations in which an attacker can find
himself.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

The concept of a self-contained theater of operations is in any case more

closely associated with defense than with attack. A number of salient
points, such as the object of the attack and the sphere of effectiveness of the
victory, have already been dealt with in Book Six, and the really basic and
essential features of attack can be expounded only in connection with the
subject of war plans. Still, enough remains to be set forth here, and we shall
once again begin by discussing a campaign intended to force a major
decision.

1. The immediate object of an attack is victory. Only by means of his

superior strength can the attacker make up for all the advantages that accrue
to the defender by virtue of his position, and possibly by the modest
advantage that his army derives from the knowledge that it is on the
attacking, the advancing side. Usually this latter is much overrated: it is
short-lived and will not stand the test of serious trouble. Naturally we
assume that the defender will act as sensibly and correctly as the attacker.
We say this in order to exclude certain vague notions about sudden assaults
and surprise attacks, which are commonly thought of as bountiful sources
of victory. They will only be that under exceptional circumstances. We have
already discussed elsewhere the nature of a genuine strategic surprise.

If an attack lacks material superiority, it must have moral superiority to

make up for its inherent weakness. Where even moral superiority is lacking,
there is no point in attacking at all, for one cannot expect to succeed.

2. Prudence is the true spirit of defense, courage and confidence the true

spirit of attack. Not that either form can do without both qualities, but each
has a stronger affinity with one of them. After all, these qualities are

necessary only because action is no mathematical construction, but has to
operate in the dark, or at best in twilight. Trust must be placed in the guide
whose qualifications are best suited to our purposes. The lower the
defender’s morale, the more daring the attacker should be.

uncertainty to the attacker. His role is to confront the defender, whose
positions are usually already known. In our discussion of the defense, on
the other hand, we argued that if the defender has chosen a poor position the
attacker should not seek him out, because the defender would have in that
case to seek him out instead, and he would then have the advantage of
catching the defender unprepared. In that case, everything would depend on
the most important road and its general direction. This point was not
discussed in the previous book, but was left until this chapter. We must
therefore examine it now.

victory, have already been discussed. If these lie within the theater of war
that we intend to attack, and within the probable sphere of victory, the
natural direction of the blow will be determined by the roads leading to
them. But one should not forget that the object of the attack usually gains
significance only with victory; victory must always be conceived in
conjunction with it. So the attacker is not interested simply in reaching the
objective: he must get there as victor. Consequently, his blow must be
aimed not just at the objective but at the road that the enemy will have to
take to reach it. The road then becomes the first objective. Victory can be
made more complete if we encounter the enemy before he has reached that
objective, cutting him off from it and getting there first. If for instance the
main objective of the attack is the enemy’s capital and the defender has not
taken up a position between it and the attacker, the latter would be making a
mistake if he advanced straight on the city. He would do better to strike at
the communications between the enemy army and its capital and there seek
the victory which will bring him to the city.

point of paramount importance is the enemy’s line of communication with
the nearest significant objective. Every attacker, therefore, has to ask
himself how he will exploit his victory after the battle. The next objective to
be won will then indicate the natural direction of his blow. If the defender

has taken up his new position in that area he has made the correct choice,
and the attacker has got to seek him out there. If that position is too strong,
the attacker must try to by-pass it, making a virtue of necessity. But if the
defender is not where he ought to be, the attacker must move in that
direction himself. As soon as he is level with the defender—assuming the
latter has made no lateral movement in the meantime—he should wheel
toward the enemy’s lines of communication with the proper objective of
seeking out his enemy there. If the latter has not moved at all, the attacker
will have to turn and take him in the rear.

Among the roads from which the attacker may choose, the great

commercial highways are the most obvious and suitable. But wherever they
form too large a detour, one should take a more direct, even if a narrower
road. A line of retreat that deviates considerably from a straight line always
involves a serious risk.

5. An attacker bent on a major decision has no reason whatever to divide

his forces. If in fact he does so, it may usually be ascribed to a state of
confusion. His columns should advance on no wider a front than will allow
them to be brought into action simultaneously. If the enemy force is
divided, so much the better; in that case, minor diversions are in order—
strategic feints, made with the object of maintaining one’s advantage.
Should the attacker choose to divide his forces for that purpose he would be
quite justified in doing so.

indispensable, must be the basis for envelopment in the tactical attack; for
envelopment is the most natural form of attack, and should not be
disregarded without good cause. But the envelopment must be tactical; a
strategic envelopment concurrent with a major blow is a complete waste of
strength. It can only be justified if the attacker is strong enough not to have
any doubts about the outcome.

communications to protect. This protection should, if possible, consist in
the direction of advance—that is, it should be automatically provided by the
army itself. If forces have to be detached for this purpose, thus causing a
diversion of strength, it can only lessen the impact of the blow. A large
army always advances on a front at least a day’s march in width; so if the

lines of communication and retreat do not deviate too much from the
perpendicular, the front itself usually provides all the cover necessary.

chiefly by the enemy’s character and situation. If everything is subordinated
to the pressure of an imminent major decision, the defender will have little
scope for auxiliary operations, and the attacker, therefore, will not
ordinarily be in great danger. But once the advance is over and the attacker
gradually goes over to a state of defense, the protection of the rear assumes
increasing urgency and importance. The attacker’s rear is inherently more
vulnerable than the defender’s; so the latter may have started operations
against the attacker’s lines of communication long before he goes over to an
actual offensive, and even while he is still on the retreat.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

a great decision, one may still want to mount a strategic attack against a
minor objective. If that attack succeeds and the objective is attained, the
situation reverts to a state of rest and balance. If difficulties are encountered
to any serious extent, the advance is halted at an earlier stage. It will then be
replaced either by offensives of opportunity or by mere strategic maneuver.
That is the nature of most campaigns.

2. Objectives of such an offensive may be:

a. A stretch of territory. This may yield food-supplies; possibly

contributions; protection of one’s own territory; or a bargaining
counter in peace negotiations. Sometimes the concept of military glory
may play a part, as it constantly did in the campaigns fought by the
French marshals under Louis XIV. The essential distinction lies in
whether the territory can be held. As a rule, that is possible only if it
borders on one’s own theater of operations and forms a natural
extension to it. Only this type can constitute a bargaining counter at the
peace table; all others are usually held temporarily, for the duration of
the campaign, to be abandoned in the winter.

b. An important depot. If it were not important, it would hardly be

considered an objective for an offensive taking up a whole campaign.
It may in itself constitute a loss to the defender and a gain to the
attacker; but the chief advantage to the latter lies in the fact that it will
force the defender to withdraw and abandon territory which he would
otherwise have held. Thus the capture of the depot is actually more of
a means, and is listed here as an end only because it is the nearest
immediate objective of action.

devoted to the capture of fortresses. It is clear from the arguments
developed there why fortresses have always been the preferred and
most desirable objectives in offensives or campaigns that could aim
neither at the enemy’s total defeat nor at the seizure of an important
part of his country. So it is easily explained why in a country like the
Netherlands, which is full of fortresses, the aim of operations has
always been the capture of one fortress or another, the eventual seizure
of the whole area rarely emerging as the objective of the campaign.
Each fortress was deemed a discrete unit, and prized for its own sake.
Apparently more attention was paid to the convenience and ease of the
enterprise than to the actual value of the place.

Still, the siege of a fortress of any size is always an important

operation because it is very expensive—an important consideration in
wars that are not fought for major issues. That is why such a siege
must be included among the significant elements of a strategic attack.
The less important the place, the less determined the siege, the fewer
the preparations made for it, the greater the likelihood of an air of
improvisation, then the more the strategic objective will shrink in
significance, and the weaker the forces and intentions to which it is
suited. Such cases often end up as shadow-boxing, simply aimed at
terminating the campaign honorably: as the attacker, one is after all
bound to do something.

sake of trophies, or possibly simply of honor, and at times merely to
satisfy a general’s ambition. Anyone who doubts that this occurs does
not know military history. Most of the offensive battles in the French
campaigns during the age of Louis XIV were of this type. It is more
important to note, however, that these considerations are not without
weight, mere quirks of vanity: they have a very definite bearing on the
peace and hence they lead fairly straight to the goal. Military honor
and the renown of an army and its generals are factors that operate
invisibly, but they constantly permeate all military activity.

Such engagements, to be sure, are based on the following

assumptions that: (a) there is a fair prospect of victory; and (b) if they
end in defeat, not too much is lost. One must be careful not to confuse

this type of battle, fought under restricted conditions for limited
objectives, with victories that were not followed up for want of moral
fiber.

 
3. With the exception of the last of these categories, (d), all can be

achieved without major engagements. The means that the offensive can use
for this purpose derive from the interests that the defender has to protect in
his theater of war. They will, therefore, consist in threatening his lines of
communication, with its depots, rich provinces, important towns, or key
points such as bridges, passes, etc.; or in the occupation of strong positions
uncomfortably located for the defender;113 or in the occupation of important
towns, fertile agricultural areas, or disaffected districts which can be
seduced into revolt; or in threatening his weaker allies, and so on. If the
attacker manages to disrupt communications to the point where the enemy
cannot restore them without serious loss, if he sets out to seize these points,
he will force the defender to take up another position to the rear or to the
flank so as to cover them, even if it means giving up lesser ones. Thus an
area is left uncovered, or a depot or fortress exposed—the former open to
conquest, the latter to siege. Major or minor engagements may result, but
they will neither be sought, nor will they be treated as objectives in
themselves, but rather as necessary evils. They cannot rise above a certain
level of magnitude and importance.

4. An operation on the part of a defender against the attacker’s lines of

communication is a type of reaction which, in a war aiming at major
decisions, can take place only if those lines become very long. But in wars
not seeking great decisions this type of reaction is more appropriate.
Admittedly the enemy’s lines will rarely be very extended, but the point
here is not to inflict severe damage on him. It will often be enough to harass
him and keep him short of supplies; and what the lines lack in length is to
some extent made up by the length of time that can be spent on this kind of
fighting. That is why the cover of his strategic flanks is of great importance
to the attacker. If this kind of contest or rivalry develops between the
attacker and the defender, the former will have to make up for his natural
disadvantages by means of his superior numbers. If his strength and
determination are still enough for him to risk a decisive blow at an enemy

unit or even at the main enemy force, this threat, held over the defender’s
head, remains his best way of covering himself.

the attacker enjoys in this sort of war: he is better placed to gauge the
enemy’s intentions and resources than the defender is to gauge his. It is a
great deal harder to predict the degree of vigor and daring with which the
attacker will act than it is to predict whether the defender is contemplating a
major stroke. In practice, the mere choice of the defensive form of warfare
generally assures a lack of positive intentions. Besides, the difference
between preparations for a major counterstroke and ordinary means of
defense is much more marked than that between the preparations for a
major attack and for a minor one. Finally, the defender is forced to make his
dispositions earlier, thus giving the attacker the advantage of a counter-
riposte.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

The loss of a fortress weakens the enemy’s defense, especially where it

constituted a vital part of it. Its occupation provides various benefits for the
attacker: he may use it as a storehouse and depot, to cover the countryside
and his billets, and so forth. And if the attack ends up as a defense, such
fortresses will be its strongest support. These relations between fortresses
and theaters of war during the progress of hostilities have all been
sufficiently treated in our discussion of fortresses in the book on defense;
the reflection of what was said there will shed the necessary light on them
in the context of attack.

Attacks on fortresses are another case in which campaigns that aim at a

great decision differ substantially from other kinds. In the former instance,
the capture of a fortress must always be considered as a necessary evil.
While a decision is still in the balance a siege will be undertaken only
where it cannot be avoided. Once the decision has been made, the crisis is
past, the tension relaxed for the moment, and a state of rest has set in, then
the occupation of fortresses will serve as a consolidation of the conquest. At
that point they can usually be taken without risk, if not without some effort
and expenditure of strength. During the crisis itself, besieging a fortress
increases the problems of the attacker. Clearly, there is nothing that will
diminish his strength so much and is therefore so likely temporarily to rob
him of his superiority. Still, there are times when a siege is unavoidable if
the attack is to progress at all. In such cases a siege should be considered as
an intensification of the attack. The fewer the decisions already reached, the
deeper the crisis will be. Further discussion of the subject belongs to the
book on war plans.

means, but the end. It will rank as a small, independent conquest, and as
such will have the following advantages:

1. A fortress is a minor conquest with precisely defined boundaries.

Taking it does not call for a major effort and one need therefore not be
worried about a setback.

2. It is a useful bargaining counter at the peace table.
3. A siege is, or at least appears to be, an intensification of the attack,

often without the decrease in strength brought about by other forms of
offensive advance.

4. A siege is an operation that cannot result in disaster.
 
All these factors combine to make the capture of one or several fortresses

a frequent objective for the type of strategic attack that cannot aim at a
higher objective.

If there is any doubt concerning which of several fortresses is to be

besieged, the choice should be based on the following principles:

a. The fortress should be easy to hold, and therefore constitute an

important bargaining counter at the peace table.

b. If the means available for its conquest are limited, only minor

fortresses can be conquered; actual occupation of a minor fortress is
preferable to an unsuccessful attack on a major one.

c. Obviously the strength of the fortifications often bears no relation to

the importance of the place. Nothing could be more foolish than to
waste one’s efforts on a place that is very strong but relatively
insignificant when one could be attacking a weaker one.

d. The strength of its armament—which includes, of course, the garrison.

If the fortress is lightly armed and held, it will naturally be easier to
take. But we must point out that the strength of the armament and
garrison are necessarily factors in the importance of a fortress: they are
direct components of the enemy’s armed strength. This is not true to
the same extent of the fortifications, so that the capture of a strongly
garrisoned fortress is more likely to be worth the sacrifices it entails
than the capture of a strongly fortified one.

because of lack of equipment. The best known examples are Prince
Eugene’s siege of Landrecies in 1712 and Frederick’s siege of Olmütz
in 1758.

f. Finally, the ease of protecting the siege is a point to bear in mind.
 
There are two basically different ways of covering a siege: one is by

entrenching the besieging force—that is, by the construction of a line of
circumvallation; the other is by a so-called line of observation. The first has
gone completely out of fashion in spite of an important point in its favor: it
permits the attacker to avoid being weakened by a dispersion of strength,
which is generally to his decided disadvantage. Still, his strength will be
markedly impaired in other ways:

1. As a rule, a position encircling the fortress requires too great an

extension in relation to the strength of the army.

2. The garrison, together with the enemy’s relieving forces, would

normally constitute simply the original enemy strength confronting us; but
now it has to be seen as an enemy unit inside our own camp, which, behind
the protection of its ramparts, is invulnerable or, at any rate, cannot be
overrun; which greatly increases its potential.

3. The defense of a line of circumvallation will only permit the use of the

absolute form. A circular position, facing outward, is the weakest, most
awkward order of battle one can imagine, and makes an advantageous sortie
virtually impossible. There is no choice but to defend oneself to the last
within one’s entrenchments. It is quite conceivable that such a situation may
lead to a reduction of defensive strength far greater than the one-third that
could probably be expected if a corps of observation were detached. If one
also bears in mind that since the days of Frederick the Great there has been
a general preference for so-called offensives (though they are not always
that in practice), for mobility and maneuver, and a general aversion to
entrenchments, one will not be surprised that a line of circumvallation is no
longer in vogue. Yet its weakening of the tactical defense is by no means its
only drawback; the bias that intrudes has merely been listed along with each
of the drawbacks, since they are closely related. Basically, a line of
circumvallation only covers that area of the theater of war which it
encloses: the rest is more or less abandoned to the enemy, except where

special detachments are deployed to cover it. But that would amount to a
division of forces, which is just what one tries to avoid. The besieger will
be constantly worried and alarmed about his supplies. In any case, the use
of a line of circumvallation to protect one’s supply lines when the army and
the supplies it needs are substantial and the enemy is in the field in
considerable strength, is possible only under conditions resembling those of
the Netherlands. There a whole system of fortresses, close to each other and
linked by a network of entrenchments, covers the rest of the operational
theater and greatly shortens supply lines. In the days before Louis XIV, the
movements of an army were not yet connected with the concept of a theater
of war. Armies, particularly in the Thirty Years War, moved about
sporadically, confronting any fortress when no hostile force was close by
and besieging it for as long as their supplies held out or until an enemy
army approached to relieve it. Then lines of circumvallation were natural
enough.

In the future they will probably not often be employed except where

conditions come close to those described above: when the enemy’s army in
the field is fairly weak, and the concept of an operational theater is rated
lower than that of a siege. Then it will be natural to concentrate one’s forces
on the siege itself, which will thus undoubtedly considerably gain in energy.

The lines of circumvallation under Louis XIV at Cambrai and

Valenciennes were of little use: Turenne took the former by force from
Condé, and Condé the latter from Turenne. Still, one should not forget the
countless occasions when they have been treated with respect, even when
there was a most urgent demand for relief and the defending commander
was a man of great enterprise. At Lille in 1708 Villars did not dare attack
the allies in their lines. At Olmütz in 1758, and at Dresden in 1760,
Frederick the Great, while not using a true line of circumvallation,
employed a system that was essentially identical: he used the same army to
conduct the siege and to cover it. He was led to do this by the distance of
the Austrian army from Olmütz, but he had cause to regret it when he lost
his convoys at Domstadtl. His reason for adopting the system at Dresden in
1760 lay in his low opinion of the Imperial army and his eagerness to
capture the city.

A final drawback to such lines is that it is harder to save the siege-train if

two away, the siege can be raised before the enemy arrives, and then the
main transport may even gain a day’s march on the enemy.

how far from the siege it should be stationed. The question is usually
decided by the terrain or by the position of other armies or units with which
the besieging army wishes to remain in contact. In most respects, it is quite
obvious that the siege is more securely covered where the distance is
greater; on the other hand, a smaller distance, of no more than a few miles,
will permit both armies to come to each other’s help.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

An average convoy of three to four hundred wagons, whatever its

contents, will be two miles long; a major convoy will be considerably
longer. How can one hope to cover this length with the handful of men that
are normally assigned as escort? Added to this difficulty is the
ponderousness of the whole, which crawls slowly along and is always in
danger of ending up in confusion. Moreover, every part requires the same
degree of cover, otherwise the whole train would stop and fall into disarray
if any part were attacked. One may well ask how the protection and defense
of such a convoy is possible at all. In other words, why is not every convoy
taken once it has been attacked, and why is not every convoy attacked if it
is worth an escort at all—that is to say, if it comes within the enemy’s
reach? Various tactical remedies have been proposed, such as Tempelhoff’s
most impractical idea of shortening convoys by constantly stopping to
reassemble and starting up again; and Scharnhorst’s far more reasonable
scheme of splitting them into several columns. But these are only modest
palliatives for a deep-seated problem.

The explanation lies in the fact that most convoys are better protected by

their general strategic situation than is any other part of the army that the
enemy may attack, and hence their limited means of defense are decidedly
more effective. That is because convoys, as a rule, move in the rear of their
own army, or at least at a considerable distance from the enemy’s.

Consequently, only minor forces can be detached to attack them, which
must protect themselves by strong reserves in order to cover their own flank
or rear against another enemy force which might suddenly materialize. Add
to this that the very unwieldiness of the wagons makes it difficult to take
them away: the attacker must usually be satisfied with cutting the traces,
taking out the horses, blowing up the ammunition carts, and so on. This will
halt the convoy and throw it into confusion, but it will not actually be lost.
It thus becomes even clearer that the convoy’s safety lies much more in the
general situation than its escort’s capacity to defend it. But if the escort
actually does so with determination—not by trying to protect the wagons
themselves, but by disrupting the enemy’s system of attack—it appears that
in the end an attack on convoys, far from being easy and reliable, is quite
difficult and uncertain.

One more main point remains to be considered: the danger that the

enemy army, or part of it, may take revenge on the attacker by inflicting a
defeat on him later, as punishment for the operation. This possibility
prevents a great many such raids without the reason ever being admitted.
We credit the escort for the convoy’s safety, and are amazed that such a
meager device should be accorded so much respect. To grasp this truth, one
should remember the famous retreat that Frederick the Great made through
Bohemia in 1758, after the siege of Olmütz: half his army was broken up
into sections in order to escort a convoy of four thousand wagons. What
prevented Daun from attacking this monstrosity? The fear that Frederick
would fall on him with the rest of his army, and engage him in a battle he
wanted to avoid. And what prevented Laudon, who was on the convoy’s
flank throughout, from attacking it sooner and with greater determination
than he did at Zischbowitz? The fear of having his knuckles rapped. He was
fifty miles away from his main force, and separated from it by the Prussian
army. He therefore believed himself to be in danger of serious defeat if the
King, who was not being kept busy by Daun, were to turn on him with the
bulk of his forces.

Convoys will be in real danger only where an army is forced by its

strategic situation to make the unnatural move of drawing its supplies from
the flank or even from the front. Then the transports do become a
worthwhile target for attack, assuming the enemy can spare the necessary
forces. One can point to the complete success of this kind of operation in

the same campaign of 1758: the capture of the Domstadtl convoy. The road
to Neisse ran to the left of the Prussian positions; Frederick’s forces were
neutralized by the siege and by having deployed a corps against Daun; the
raiders did not have to worry about their own safety, and could attack the
convoy at their leisure.

When Prince Eugene was besieging Landrecies in 1712, he procured his

supplies from Bouchain, via Denain—that is to say, from the front of his
strategic position. Everyone knows the measures he adopted to provide
cover under these difficult conditions, and the difficulties in which he got
involved; the outcome being a complete transformation of the situation.

attacking a convoy is strategically not very advantageous. It promises
worthwhile results only in the unusual event of seriously exposed lines of
communication.

treated as a separate topic. For one thing, such an attack is a highly
specialized operation; for another, it can be considered as a very effective
strategic move. We are not talking about an attack on a single billet or on a
small unit quartered in a few villages: that would be a purely tactical affair.
We are concerned with an attack on a substantial force in billets covering a
fairly wide area. The aim is no longer an assault on an individual billet, but
the prevention of the enemy’s ability to concentrate.

An attack on an army in billets is therefore an attack on a dispersed army.

The assault can be considered a success if the enemy is unable to reach his
prearranged assembly point and has to find another further to the rear. Such
a redeployment in a state of emergency will seldom be made at a cost of
less than a day’s march, and usually takes longer. The loss of ground
involved is no small matter, and that is the first advantage which falls to the
attacker.

An assault of this sort may be designed to affect the general situation, but

initially it may bear upon individual billets at the same time. Certainly it
will not affect them all or even very many of them, since that would entail
far greater extension and dispersal of the attacking army than would be
advisable. Therefore, only the nearest billets—those that lie in the attacker’s
path—can be taken by surprise; and even this will seldom be completely
successful, for a substantial force is unlikely to be able to approach
unnoticed. Still, this is an aspect of the attack that should by no means be

disregarded; its results can be considered as the second advantage of such
an assault.

fight, and in which he may suffer serious losses. After all, a substantial
force does not assemble by battalions at the main point of concentration. It
usually first forms up in brigades, divisions, and even army corps. Units of
that size cannot simply flee to the rendezvous; on the contrary, if they make
contact with an enemy column, they must accept battle. They may win of
course—especially if the attacking column is not strong enough—but even
then they will lose time, and, we need hardly add, the general rearward
movement means that they are unlikely, as a rule, to make good use of their
success. On the other hand, they may be beaten, which is inherently more
likely because they have not had the time to organize an effective
resistance. It is therefore quite probable that, if an assault has been well-
planned and executed, these separate actions may yield the attacker
important trophies, which in turn may become major parts of the general
result.

the fact that the enemy is temporarily thrown off balance and demoralized,
so that he can seldom make use of his force when it is finally assembled.
Usually, he will have to yield even more ground, and in general completely
change his plan of operations.

on enemy billets—that is to say, one that prevents the enemy from
assembling his force without losses at a previously chosen rendezvous. But
depending on the circumstances, there are many degrees of success: the
results may be worth a great deal in one case, and next to nothing in
another. Yet even when the operation is so successful that it has significant
results, these can seldom compare with those of a major victory; partly
because the trophies are rarely so impressive, and partly because the
psychological effect is not comparable.

Let us remember that that is all there is to the result; otherwise one may

expect more from such an operation than it can deliver. There are people
who consider it the paragon of offensive effectiveness, but, as we see from
this analysis as well as from military history, that is by no means the case.

Lorraine sprang on the French billets under General Rantzau at Tuttlingen
in 1643. The corps was 16,000 strong, and lost its commanding general and
7,000 men. It was a total defeat, caused by the complete absence of
outposts.

call it, Mariendal) the effect was also tantamount to a defeat. He lost 3,000
of his 8,000 men, mainly because, once his troops were assembled, he badly
mistimed his resistance. One should thus not count on frequent results of
this sort. In this case they were caused not so much by the surprise itself as
by a badly handled fight. Turenne could quite well have avoided the action
and joined up somewhere else with the troops stationed in more distant
billets.

against the allied positions in Alsace under the Great Elector, the Imperial
General Bournonville, and the Duke of Lorraine. The trophies were modest,
and the allies only lost 2,000 or 3,000 men, which, from a force of 50,000,
was far from being decisive. Still, they no longer felt able to put up any
resistance in Alsace, and withdrew across the Rhine. This strategic success
was all that Turenne wanted, but it was not caused by the assault itself.
Turenne surprised the enemy’s plans rather than his troops; disagreements
among the allied generals and the proximity of the Rhine did the rest. This
whole affair actually deserves much closer study because it is usually
misinterpreted.

to make Frederick change front and fight the battle of Mollwitz before his
troops were completely assembled.

Lusatia, success was mainly due to the actual assault on one of the most
important billets, namely Hennersdorf, where the Austrians lost 2,000 men.
As a general consequence, the Duke of Lorraine withdrew to Bohemia by
way of upper Lusatia. This did not prevent him, however, from reentering
Saxony on the left bank of the Elbe, so no important results would have
been achieved at all but for the battle of Kesselsdorf.

In 1758 Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick surprised the French in billets. As

the value of such attacks, only the first two may be equated with victories in
battle. In these cases, however, the corps were small, and the absence of
outposts, characteristic of war at the time, was a very favorable
circumstance. The other four cases, even though they must be counted
among the greatest successes of their kind, were, judging by their results,
obviously not in the same class as victory in battle. General success can
only be achieved against a weak-willed and characterless adversary; so it
was not obtained against Frederick in 1741.

The chances seemed good: Bonaparte had not yet arrived, and the French
were widely scattered in billets. Under these circumstances, the Prussians,
had they attacked with speed and determination, might well have expected
to drive the French back over the Rhine with appreciable losses. But that
was all. Had they aimed at anything more—at pursuing their advantage
across the Rhine, for instance, or at gaining a psychological superiority
great enough to keep the French from returning to the right bank of the
Rhine for the rest of the campaign—their calculations would have lacked
any real basis.

Smolensk on the billets when Napoleon’s army had halted near Vitebsk. But
their courage failed them when it came to executing the plan—which was
just as well for them. Not only was the French center twice as strong as
their own, but the French commander was the most determined general the
world has ever seen. Anyhow, the loss of a few miles would have settled
nothing; there was no natural obstacle close enough on which they could
have driven an advantage home and established a reasonably secure
position. This was not the kind of campaign that drags feebly on to its
conclusion, but the first plan ever made by an attacker bent on the complete
destruction of his adversary.114 The minor advantages to be gained by a
surprise attack on billets could, therefore, never have been anything but
grossly disproportionate to the needs of the situation; nor could they

possibly offset so great a disparity of strength and resources. The attempt,
however, showed how easily a confused idea of what the operation might
achieve could lead to a completely incorrect application.

execution is not merely a tactical matter, however, but in part also belongs
to strategy. The reason is that such an assault is normally made on a front of
considerable breadth and the attacking army may not, and generally will
not, have enough time to concentrate before going into action. The whole
affair, therefore, consists of a number of separate engagements.
Accordingly we now propose to say a few words on how an attack of this
sort can best be organized.

certain width of front. This is the only way in which one can actually
assault some quarters, cut off others, and in general throw the enemy force
into the desired state of chaos. Conditions will determine how many
columns should be used, and how far apart they ought to be.

Second, the columns must converge upon some chosen meeting point.

The enemy will end up concentrated to some extent, so our troops must do
the same. If possible, that point should be in the same place as the enemy’s
or located along his line of retreat—preferably where the latter crosses a
natural obstacle.

him with great determination, daring and bravery. Circumstances are by and
large on its side, and where that is so audacity is in order. For this reason the
commander of each column should be given a wide degree of latitude and
authority.

Fourth, the tactical plan for attacking the first enemy units that make a

stand must be aimed at turning their flanks, since the key to success is
always to split the enemy and isolate each part.

be short of cavalry. In fact, it may be advantageous to distribute the reserve
cavalry among them: it would be a serious mistake to assume that a cavalry
reserve on its own could play a major part in this kind of operation. It
would be held up at the first village it came to, the smallest bridge, or the
most insignificant thicket.

advance guard far ahead—though this holds true only until the first
approach has been made. Once fighting has started in the line of enemy
billets, the actual surprise has been gained. Then every column must
dispatch advance guards of all arms as far ahead as possible. These, moving
fast, will be able to add substantially to the enemy’s confusion. This is the
only means of occasionally capturing the welter of baggage and guns,
supply units, and men on special duty that usually trail in the wake of troops
that have suddenly abandoned their billets; and the advance guards will
become the most effective means of turning the enemy and cutting off
isolated units.

arrange for a withdrawal, and assign a rallying point for the army.

CHAPTER TWENTY

In such a diversion there must, of course, be an objective to attack. Only

the value of this objective can induce the enemy to dispatch troops for its
protection. Besides, if the operation fails as a diversion, the objective will
serve as a compensation for the effort expended on capturing it.

These objectives may be fortresses, important depots, large and wealthy

towns—especially capital cities—contributions of all sorts, and, finally,
cooperation with disaffected subjects of the enemy.

Diversions can obviously be useful but this is not by any means

invariably so. Sometimes they can actually do harm. The main requirement
is that the enemy should withdraw more men from the main scene of
operations than are used for the diversion. If the numbers are even, the
effectiveness of the diversion as such ceases, and the operation becomes
merely a subordinate attack. Even where a subordinate attack is called for
because a major objective might be achieved by a very small expenditure of
strength—the easy capture of an important fortress, for example—one
should not call it a diversion. Another kind of action is commonly called a
diversion: when a state, while defending itself against another, is attacked
by a third; but the only difference between that attack and an ordinary one is
its direction. There is no reason for giving it a special name: in theoretical
discussion, particular terms should be reserved for particular qualities.

If small forces are to draw off larger ones, there must obviously be

special circumstances at the root of it. For a diversion to be effective it is
not enough arbitrarily to dispatch troops to a previously unoccupied place.

of operations with a small force, say a thousand men—to levy
contributions, and so forth, the enemy cannot, of course, expect to stop it by
sending out a thousand men of his own: it will certainly take more than that
to keep the area free of raiders. But, one may ask, could not the defender,
instead of protecting his own ground, restore the balance by sending a force
of equal strength to raid an equivalent area of the enemy’s? Indeed, if the
attacker is to reap an advantage, he must start by making sure that there is
more to be carried off or threatened in the defender’s area than in his own.
Where that is so, even a fairly weak diversion cannot fail to keep a much
larger enemy force occupied. On the other hand, the advantage will in the
nature of the case diminish as the numbers grow: 50,000 men can defend a
fairly large area not only against an equal number, but even against a
slightly larger one. So the value of large-scale diversion is very doubtful;
and the larger it is the more the remaining circumstances must favor the
diversion if it is to be successful at all.

The following factors may be favorable:

a. Forces that the attacker can make available for the diversion without

detracting from his main offensive

b. Vulnerable objectives of great importance to the enemy
c. Disaffected enemy subjects
d. An area rich enough to yield substantial war material.
 
If diversions are attempted only if they promise success after having

passed these various tests, we will find that favorable opportunities do not
arise very often.

Another important point remains to be considered. Diversions always

bring the war into an area that would otherwise have been left untouched.
Enemy forces that would otherwise be dormant are consequently in some
degree brought to life. This will be very marked if the enemy’s war plans
have included a militia and arms are available for distribution to the
populace.

It is quite natural, and experience has frequently illustrated this, that

when an area is suddenly threatened and no preparations have been made to
defend it, such capable officials as there may be on the spot will mobilize

all available extraordinary means to deal with the danger. New means of
resistance are created—means that border on guerrilla warfare and can
easily bring it about.

This point should be kept very much in mind when a diversion is

considered; otherwise one may be digging one’s own grave.

Take, for instance, the landings in North Holland in 1799 and on

Walcheren in 1809. As diversions they can only be justified by the fact that
the British troops could not be used in any other way; yet they undeniably
left the French defenses stronger than before, just as a landing in France
itself would have done. Much, of course, was to be gained by threatening
the coast of France, for the threat alone would neutralize a large force that
had to be detailed to guard against it; but one can only justify a landing in
force if one can count on the support of the area against its government.

legitimate it is to make diversions—but, of course, the smaller are the gains
one can expect. Such diversions are simply a means of stirring up a
situation.

for no special characteristics apart from speed and daring.

2. It may, however, be calculated to look more important than it is, thus

being at the same time a feint. The exact means that should be used to
achieve this can only be determined by an acute mind, with close
knowledge of the circumstances and forces involved. It will inevitably
involve considerable dispersal of forces.

3. If the forces involved are not inconsiderable, and the retreat is

restricted to certain points, it is essential to maintain a reserve on which the

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

Victory normally results from the superiority of one side; from a greater

aggregate of physical and psychological strength. This superiority is
certainly augmented by the victory, otherwise it would not be so coveted or
command so high a price. That is an automatic consequence of victory
itself. Its effects exert a similar influence, but only up to a point. That point
may be reached quickly—at times so quickly that the total consequences of
a victorious battle may be limited to an increase in psychological
superiority alone. We now propose to examine how that comes about.

As a war unfolds, armies are constantly faced with some factors that

increase their strength and with others that reduce it. The question therefore
is one of superiority. Every reduction in strength on one side can be
considered as an increase on the other. It follows that this two-way process
is to be found in attack as well as in defense.

What we have to do is examine the principal cause of this change in one

of these instances, and so at the same time determine the other.

In an advance, the principal causes of additional strength are:

1. The losses suffered by the defending forces are usually heavier than

those of the attacker.

2. The defender’s loss of fixed assets such as magazines, depots, bridges,

and the like, is not experienced by the attacker.

time we enter his territory.

words, he can live at the enemy’s expense.

components of his force.

6. Some allies are lost to the defender, others turn to the invader.
7. Finally, the defender is discouraged, and so to some extent disarmed.
 
The causes of loss in strength for an invading army are:

1. The invader has to besiege, assault or observe the enemy’s fortresses;

while the defender, if he has previously been doing the same, will now
add the units so employed to his main force.

2. The moment an invader enters enemy territory, the nature of the

operational theater changes. It becomes hostile. It must be garrisoned,
for the invader can control it only to the extent that he has done so; but
this creates difficulties for the entire machine, which will inevitably
weaken its effectiveness.

3. The invader moves away from his sources of supply, while the

defender moves closer to his own. This causes delay in the
replacement of his forces.

4. The danger threatening the defender will bring allies to his aid.
5. Finally, the defender, being in real danger, makes the greater effort,

whereas the efforts of the victor slacken off.

 
All these advantages and disadvantages may coexist; they can meet, so to

speak, and pursue their ways in opposite directions. Only the last meet as
true opposites: they cannot by-pass one another, so they are mutually
exclusive. That alone is enough to show the infinite range of effects a
victory can have—depending on whether they stun the loser or rouse him to
greater efforts.

We shall try to qualify each of the above points in a few brief comments.

1. The enemy’s losses may be at their maximum directly after his

defeat, and then diminish daily until the point is reached where his

strength equals ours. On the other hand, his losses may grow
progressively day by day. All depends on differences in the overall
situation and circumstances. Generally speaking, one can only say that
the former is more likely to occur with a good army, the latter with a
bad one. The most important factor besides the spirit of the troops is
the spirit of the government. It is vital in war to distinguish between
the two, or one may stop at the very point where one should really
start, and vice versa.

2. The enemy’s loss of fixed assets may decrease or increase in the

same way, depending on the location and nature of his supply depots.
Nowadays, incidentally, this point is no longer so important as the
others.

3. The third advantage cannot fail to grow with the progress of the

advance. Indeed one can say that it only begins to count when the
attack has penetrated deep into enemy territory—when a third or at
least a quarter has been taken. A further factor is an area’s intrinsic
value in relation to the war effort.

4. The fourth advantage is also bound to increase as the advance

proceeds.

In connection with these two last points, it should be noted that they

seldom have an immediate effect on troops in action. Their work is
slow and indirect. Therefore one should not on their account make too
great an effort and so place oneself in too dangerous a situation.

5. The fifth advantage also only begins to tell after an army has

advanced some distance, and when the configuration of the enemy’s
country provides an opportunity to isolate certain areas from the rest.
Like tightly constricted branches, these will then tend to wither away.

6. and 7. It is probable, at all events, that the sixth and seventh

advantages will increase with the advance. We shall return to them
later on.

 
Now let us turn to the causes for loss in strength.

1. In most cases as an advance proceeds, there will be more sieges,

assaults, and investments of fortresses. This on its own is so
debilitating to the available fighting forces that it may easily cancel out

all other advantages. True, in modern times one has begun to assault
fortresses with very few troops and to observe them with still smaller
numbers, and the enemy has, of course, to find garrisons for them.
Nevertheless, fortresses remain an important element of security. Half
the garrisons may usually consist of men who have not so far taken
part in the war; yet one must still leave twice their strength in front of
the fortresses on one’s line of communication; and if even a single
important place has to be formally besieged or starved out, it will call
for a small army.

2. The second cause of weakening, the establishment of a theater of

operations in enemy territory, grows, of course, with the advance. It
may not immediately deplete the strength of the forces, but in the long
run it will be even more effective than the first factor.

 
The only parts of enemy territory one can treat as being within one’s

theater of operations are those one has actually occupied—by leaving small
units in the field, by intermittent garrisons stationed in the major towns, by
units established at the relay stations, and so on. Small as each of these
garrisons may be, they all deplete the army’s fighting strength. But that is
the least important part.

Every army has strategic flanks—that is, the areas along both sides of its

lines of communication; but since the enemy’s army has the same, these are
hardly considered a source of weakness. That, however, only holds true in
one’s own country. Once on enemy soil the weakness becomes palpable. If
a long line of communications is covered poorly or not at all, the smallest
operation against it holds out promise of success; and in enemy territory
raiders may appear from any quarter.

The further the advance, the longer these flanks become, and the risks

they represent will progressively increase. Not only are they hard to cover,
but the very length of unprotected lines of communication tends to
challenge the enemy’s spirit of enterprise; and the consequences their loss
can have in the event of a retreat are very grave indeed.

All this contributes to place a new burden on an advancing army with

every step it takes; so unless it started with exceptional superiority, it will
find its freedom of action dwindling and its offensive power progressively

reduced. In the end, it will feel unsure of itself and nervous about its
situation.

3. The third factor, the distance from the sources that must send continual

replacements for this steadily weakening army, will increase
proportionately with the advance. In this respect a conquering army is
like the light of a lamp; as the oil that feeds it sinks and draws away
from the focus, the light diminishes until at last it goes out altogether.

problem, but it can never eliminate it altogether. There are always things
that must be supplied from home—especially men. In general, deliveries
from enemy resources are neither so prompt nor so reliable as those from
one’s own. In an emergency, help takes longer to arrive, while
misunderstandings and mistakes of all kinds cannot be brought to light and
rectified so promptly.

If a monarch does not command his troops in person, as has become

customary in recent wars, if he is no longer easily available, a new and very
serious handicap arises from the loss of time involved in the transmission of
messages. Even the widest powers conferred on a commander will not
suffice to meet every contingency that may arise in his sphere of action.

4. The change in political alignments. If these changes, resulting from his

victories, are likely to be to the disadvantage of the victor, they will
probably be so in direct proportion to his advance—which is also the
case if they are to his advantage. All depends on the existing political
affiliations, interests, traditions, lines of policy, and the personalities of
princes, ministers, favorites, mistresses, and so forth. The only general
comment one can make is that after the defeat of a major power with
lesser allies, these will quickly desert their leader. In this respect, the
victor will then gain strength with every blow. If, on the other hand,
the defeated state is smaller, protectors will appear much sooner if its
very existence is threatened. Others who may have helped to endanger
it will detach themselves if they believe that the success is becoming
too great.

and panic-stricken, the enemy may lay down his arms, at other times
he may be seized by a fit of enthusiasm: there is a general rush to
arms, and resistance is much stronger after the first defeat than it was
before. The information from which one must guess at the probable
reaction include the character of the people and the government, the
nature of the country, and its political affiliations.

 
The last two points alone can make an infinite difference to the plans that

one can and must make in war to take account of either possibility.
While one man may lose his best chance through timidity and following so-
called orthodox procedures, another will plunge in head first and end up
looking as dazed and surprised as if he had just been fished out of the water.

Further, one should be conscious of the slackening of effort that not

infrequently occurs on the part of the victor after the danger has been
overcome, and when, on the contrary, fresh efforts are called for to follow
up the victory. If we take an overall view of these differing and opposing
principles, we will doubtless conclude that the utilization of the victory, a
continued advance in an offensive campaign, will usually swallow up the
superiority with which one began or which was gained by the victory.

At this point we are bound to ask: if all this is true, why does the winner

persist in pursuing his victorious course, in advancing his offensive? Can
one really still call this a “utilization of victory?” Would he not do better to
stop before he begins to lose the upper hand?

The obvious answer is that superior strength is not the end but only the

means. The end is either to bring the enemy to his knees or at least to
deprive him of some of his territory—the point in that case being not to
improve the current military position but to improve one’s general prospects
in the war and in the peace negotiations. Even if one tries to destroy the
enemy completely, one must accept the fact that every step gained may
weaken one’s superiority—though it does not necessarily follow that it must
fall to zero before the enemy capitulates. He may do so at an earlier point,
and if this can be accomplished with one’s last ounce of superiority, it
would be a mistake not to have used it.

Thus the superiority one has or gains in war is only the means and not the

end; it must be risked for the sake of the end. But one must know the point

to which it can be carried in order not to overshoot the target; otherwise
instead of gaining new advantages, one will disgrace oneself.

how loss of superiority affects a strategic attack. Indeed, such instances
occur so frequently that we have felt it necessary to investigate their
underlying causes. Only with the rise of Bonaparte have there been
campaigns between civilized states where superiority has consistently led to
the enemy’s collapse. Before his time, every campaign had ended with the
winning side attempting to reach a state of balance in which it could
maintain itself. At that point, the progress of victory stopped, and a retreat
might even be called for. This culminating point in victory is bound to recur
in every future war in which the destruction of the enemy cannot be the
military aim, and this will presumably be true of most wars. The natural
goal of all campaign plans, therefore, is the turning point at which attack
becomes defense.

effort which could not add to success. It would in fact be a damaging one,
which would lead to a reaction; and experience goes to show that such
reactions usually have completely disproportionate effects. This is such a
universal experience, and appears so natural and easy to understand, that
there is no need for a laborious investigation of its causes. The main causes
are always the lack of organization in newly occupied territory, and the
psychological effect of the stark contrast between the serious losses
sustained and the successes that had been hoped for. There is an unusually
active interplay between the extremes of morale—on the one hand,
encouragement often verging on bravado, and on the other, depression. As a
result, losses will be heavier during a retreat, and one can usually be
grateful if one has to sacrifice only conquered territory, and not one’s native
soil.

At this point we must eliminate an apparent inconsistency.
This rests on the assumption that so long as an attack progresses there

must still be some superiority on its side; further, that since defense (the
more effective form of war) must start when the advance ends, one may not
really be in much danger of imperceptibly becoming the weaker side. Yet
that is what happens; history forces us to admit that the risk of a set-back

often does not reach its peak until the moment when the attack has lost its
impetus and is turning into defense. We must look for the reason.

rests on the following:

1. The utilization of terrain
2. The possession of an organized theater of operations
3. The support of the population
4. The advantage of being on the waiting side.
 
It is obvious that these factors will not everywhere be found in equal

strength, or always be equally effective. One defense is therefore not
exactly like another, nor will defense always enjoy the same degree of
superiority over attack. In particular this will be the case in a defense that
follows directly the exhaustion of an offensive—a defense whose theater of
operations is located at the apex of an offensive wedge thrust forward deep
into hostile territory. Only the first of the four factors listed above, the
utilization of terrain, will remain unchanged in such a defense; the second is
usually eliminated, the third works in reverse, and the fourth is much
reduced in strength. A word or two in explanation of this last point may be
useful.

In an imaginary equilibrium, whole campaigns might often end without

result because the side that should take the initiative lacks determination.
That, in our view, is exactly why it is an advantage to be able to await the
enemy. But if an offensive act upsets this equilibrium, damages the enemy’s
interests and impels him into action, he is far less likely to remain inactive
and irresolute. A defense is far more provocative in character when it is
undertaken on occupied territory than it is on one’s own; it is, so to speak,
infected with the virus of attack, and this weakens its basic character. In
Silesia and Saxony Daun granted Frederick a period of calm that he would
never have allowed in Bohemia.

It is clear, therefore, that a defense that is undertaken in the framework of

an offensive is weakened in all its key elements. It will thus no longer
possess the superiority which basically belongs to it.

Just as no defensive campaign consists simply of defensive elements, so

no offensive campaign consists purely of offensive ones. Apart from the

short intervals in every campaign during which both sides are on the
defensive, every attack which does not lead to peace must necessarily end
up as a defense.

sophistry, we consider it to be the greatest disadvantage of the attack that
one is eventually left in a most awkward defensive position.

This will explain why there is a gradual reduction in the difference

between the original effectiveness of attack and defense as forms of
warfare. We now propose to show how this difference can for a time vanish
altogether and reverse itself completely.

physical force requires time to become effective. A force that, if gently and
gradually applied, would suffice to arrest a body in motion, will be
overcome by it if there is not enough time for it to operate. This law of
physics provides a pertinent image of many features of our own
psychology. Once our train of thought is set in a certain direction, many
reasons which would otherwise be basically adequate to do so will not be
able to deflect or arrest it. Time, repose, and a sustained impact on one’s
consciousness are needed. It is the same in war. Once the mind is set on a
certain course toward its goal, or once it has turned back toward a refuge, it
may easily happen that arguments which would compel one man to stop,
and justify another in acting, will not easily be fully appreciated.
Meanwhile the action continues, and in the sweep of motion one crosses the
threshold of equilibrium, the line of culmination, without knowing it. It is
even possible that the attacker, reinforced by the psychological forces
peculiar to attack, will in spite of his exhaustion find it less difficult to go
on than to stop—like a horse pulling a load uphill. We believe that this
demonstrates without inconsistency how an attacker can overshoot the point
at which, if he stopped and assumed the defensive, there would still be a
chance of success—that is, of equilibrium. It is therefore important to
calculate this point correctly when planning the campaign. An attacker may
otherwise take on more than he can manage and, as it were, get into debt; a
defender must be able to recognize this error if the enemy commits it, and
exploit it to the full.

In reviewing the whole array of factors a general must weigh before

value of the most important ones only by considering numerous other
possibilities—some immediate, some remote. He must guess, so to speak:
guess whether the first shock of battle will steel the enemy’s resolve and
stiffen his resistance, or whether, like a Bologna flask, it will shatter as soon
as its surface is scratched; guess the extent of debilitation and paralysis that
the drying up of particular sources of supply and the severing of certain
lines of communication will cause in the enemy; guess whether the burning
pain of the injury he has been dealt will make the enemy collapse with
exhaustion or, like a wounded bull, arouse his rage; guess whether the other
powers will be frightened or indignant, and whether and which political
alliances will be dissolved or formed. When we realize that he must hit
upon all this and much more by means of his discreet judgment, as a
marksman hits a target, we must admit that such an accomplishment of the
human mind is no small achievement. Thousands of wrong turns running in
all directions tempt his perception; and if the range, confusion and
complexity of the issues are not enough to overwhelm him, the dangers and
responsibilities may.

their objective rather than risk approaching it too closely, and why those
with high courage and an enterprising spirit will often overshoot it and so
fail to attain their purpose. Only the man who can achieve great results with
limited means has really hit the mark.

BOOK EIGHT

Then we examined, one by one, the salient patterns and situations (apart

from battle itself) that occur in warfare, trying to gauge the value of each
with greater precision, both according to its inherent characteristics and in
the light of military experience. We also sought to strip away the vague,
ambiguous notions commonly attached to them, and tried to make it
absolutely clear that the destruction of the enemy is what always matters
most.

We now revert to warfare as a whole, to the discussion of the planning of

a war and of a campaign, which means returning to the ideas put forward in
Book One.

The chapters that follow will deal with the problem of war as a whole.

They cover its dominant, its most important aspect: pure strategy. We enter
this crucial area—the central point on which all other threads converge—
not without some diffidence. Indeed, this diffidence is amply justified.

On the one hand, military operations appear extremely simple. The

greatest generals discuss them in the plainest and most forthright language;
and to hear them tell how they control and manage that enormous, complex
apparatus one would think the only thing that mattered was the speaker, and

that the whole monstrosity called war came down, in fact, to a contest
between individuals, a sort of duel. A few uncomplicated thoughts seem to
account for their decisions—either that, or the explanation lies in various
emotional states; and one is left with the impression that great commanders
manage matters in an easy, confident and, one would almost think, off-hand
sort of way. At the same time we can see how many factors are involved
and have to be weighed against each other; the vast, the almost infinite
distance there can be between a cause and its effect, and the countless ways
in which these elements can be combined. The function of theory is to put
all this in systematic order, clearly and comprehensively, and to trace each
action to an adequate, compelling cause. When we contemplate all this, we
are overcome by the fear that we shall be irresistibly dragged down to a
state of dreary pedantry, and grub around in the underworld of ponderous
concepts where no great commander, with his effortless coup d‘oeil, was
ever seen. If that were the best that theoretical studies could produce it
would be better never to have attempted them in the first place. Men of
genuine talent would despise them and they would quickly be forgotten.
When all is said and done, it really is the commander’s coup d’oeil, his
ability to see things simply, to identify the whole business of war
completely with himself, that is the essence of good generalship. Only if the
mind works in this comprehensive fashion can it achieve the freedom it
needs to dominate events and not be dominated by them.

we keep to the path we set ourselves at the beginning. Theory should cast a
steady light on all phenomena so that we can more easily recognize and
eliminate the weeds that always spring from ignorance; it should show how
one thing is related to another, and keep the important and the unimportant
separate. If concepts combine of their own accord to form that nucleus of
truth we call a principle, if they spontaneously compose a pattern that
becomes a rule, it is the task of the theorist to make this clear.

The insights gained and garnered by the mind in its wanderings among

basic concepts are benefits that theory can provide. Theory cannot equip the
mind with formulas for solving problems, nor can it mark the narrow path
on which the sole solution is supposed to lie by planting a hedge of
principles on either side. But it can give the mind insight into the great mass
of phenomena and of their relationships, then leave it free to rise into the

higher realms of action. There the mind can use its innate talents to
capacity, combining them all so as to seize on what is right and true as
though this were a single idea formed by their concentrated pressure—as
though it were a response to the immediate challenge rather than a product
of thought.

We said in the opening chapter that the natural aim of military operations

is the enemy’s overthrow, and that strict adherence to the logic of the
concept can, in the last analysis, admit of no other. Since both belligerents
must hold that view it would follow that military operations could not be
suspended, that hostilities could not end until one or other side were finally
defeated.

In the chapter on the suspension of military activity116 we showed how

factors inherent in the war-machine itself can interrupt and modify the
principle of enmity as embodied in its agent, man, and in all that goes to
make up warfare. Still, that process of modification is by no means
adequate to span the gap between the pure concept of war and the concrete
form that, as a general rule, war assumes. Most wars are like a flaring-up of
mutual rage, when each party takes up arms in order to defend itself, to
overawe its opponent, and occasionally to deal him an actual blow.
Generally it is not a case in which two mutually destructive elements
collide, but one of tension between two elements, separate for the time
being, which discharge energy in discontinuous, minor shocks.

But what exactly is this nonconducting medium, this barrier that prevents

a full discharge? Why is it that the theoretical concept is not fulfilled in

practice? The barrier in question is the vast array of factors, forces and
conditions in national affairs that are affected by war. No logical sequence
could progress through their innumerable twists and turns as though it were
a simple thread that linked two deductions. Logic comes to a stop in this
labyrinth; and those men who habitually act, both in great and minor affairs,
on particular dominating impressions or feelings rather than according to
strict logic, are hardly aware of the confused, inconsistent, and ambiguous
situation in which they find themselves.

The man in overall command may actually have examined all these

matters without losing sight of his objective for an instant; but the many
others concerned cannot all have achieved the same insight. Opposition
results, and in consequence something is required to overcome the vast
inertia of the mass. But there is not usually enough energy available for this.

This inconsistency can appear in either belligerent party or in both, and it

is the reason why war turns into something quite different from what it
should be according to theory—turns into something incoherent and
incomplete.

truth at all in our concept of the absolute character of war were it not for the
fact that with our own eves we have seen warfare achieve this state of
absolute perfection. After the short prelude of the French Revolution,
Bonaparte brought it swiftly and ruthlessly to that point. War, in his hands,
was waged without respite until the enemy succumbed, and the counter-
blows were struck with almost equal energy. Surely it is both natural and
inescapable that this phenomenon should cause us to turn again to the pure
concept of war with all its rigorous implications.

Are we then to take this as the standard, and judge all wars by it, however

much they may diverge? Should we deduce our entire theory from it? The
question is whether that should be the only kind of war or whether there can
be other valid forms. We must make up our minds before we can say
anything intelligent about war plans.

logical necessity, and will tend to be clear and unambiguous. But in that
case, what are we to say about all the wars that have been fought since the
days of Alexander—excepting certain Roman campaigns—down to
Bonaparte? We should have to condemn them outright, but might be

appalled at our presumption if we did so. Worse still, we should be bound to
say that in spite of our theory there may even be other wars of this kind in
the next ten years, and that our theory, though strictly logical, would not
apply to reality. We must, therefore, be prepared to develop our concept of
war as it ought to be fought, not on the basis of its pure definition, but by
leaving room for every sort of extraneous matter. We must allow for natural
inertia, for all the friction of its parts, for all the inconsistency, imprecision,
and timidity of man; and finally we must face the fact that war and its forms
result from ideas, emotions, and conditions prevailing at the time—and to
be quite honest we must admit that this was the case even when war
assumed its absolute state under Bonaparte.

a war are not the result of any ultimate resolution of the vast array of
circumstances involved, but only of those features that happen to be
dominant. It follows that war is dependent on the interplay of possibilities
and probabilities, of good and bad luck, conditions in which strictly logical
reasoning often plays no part at all and is always apt to be a most unsuitable
and awkward intellectual tool. It follows, too, that war can be a matter of
degree.

absolute form of war and to make that form a general point of reference, so
that he who wants to learn from theory becomes accustomed to keeping that
point in view constantly, to measuring all his hopes and fears by it, and to
approximating it when he can or when he must.

them a certain tone and character, though the immediate causes of our
action may have different origins, just as the tone a painter gives to his
canvas is determined by the color of the underpainting.

Without the cautionary examples of the destructive power of war unleashed,
theory would preach to deaf ears. No one would have believed possible
what has now been experienced by all.

Would Prussia in 1792117 have dared to invade France with 70,000 men

if she had had an inkling that the repercussions in case of failure would be
strong enough to overthrow the old European balance of power? Would she,

in 1806, have risked war with France with 100,000 men, if she had
suspected that the first shot would set off a mine that was to blow her to the
skies?

A. Interdependence of the Elements of War

In the absolute form of war, where everything results from necessary

causes and one action rapidly affects another, there is, if we may use the
phrase, no intervening neutral void. Since war contains a host of
interactions118 since the whole series of engagements is, strictly speaking,
linked together,119 since in every victory there is a culminating point
beyond which lies the realm of losses and defeats120—in view of all these
intrinsic characteristics of war, we say there is only one result that counts:
final victory. Until then, nothing is decided, nothing won, and nothing lost.
In this form of war we must always keep in mind that it is the end that
crowns the work. Within the concept of absolute war, then, war is
indivisible, and its component parts (the individual victories) are of value
only in their relation to the whole. Conquering Moscow and half of Russia
in 1812 was of no avail to Bonaparte unless it brought him the peace he had
in view. But these successes were only a part of his plan of campaign: what
was still missing was the destruction of the Russian army. If that
achievement had been added to the rest, peace would have been as sure as
things of that sort ever can be. But it was too late to achieve the second part
of his plan; his chance had gone. Thus the successful stage was not only
wasted but led to disaster.

Contrasting with this extreme view of the connection between successes

in war, is another view, no less extreme; which holds that war consists of
separate successes each unrelated to the next, as in a match consisting of
several games. The earlier games have no effect upon the later. All that
counts is the total score, and each separate result makes its contribution
toward this total.

the subject; the second, from its actual history. Countless cases have
occurred where a small advantage could be gained without an onerous
condition being attached to it. The more the element of violence is
moderated, the commoner these cases will be; but just as absolute war has
never in fact been achieved, so we will never find a war in which the
second concept is so prevalent that the first can be disregarded altogether. If
we postulate the first of the two concepts, it necessarily follows from the
start that every war must be conceived of as a single whole, and that with
his first move the general must already have a clear idea of the goal on
which all lines are to converge.

minor advantages for their own sake and leave the future to itself.

either. Theory makes this distinction in the application of the two concepts:
all action must be based on the former, since it is the fundamental concept;
the latter can be used only as a modification justified by circumstances.

and Saxony, thrust new spearheads into Austria, he was well aware that
they could not lead to another permanent acquisition such as Silesia and
Saxony. His aim was not to overthrow the Austrian Empire but a secondary
one, namely to gain time and strength. And he could pursue this secondary
aim without any fear of risking his own existence.121

However, when Prussia in 1806, and Austria in 1805 and 1809, adopted a

still more modest aim—to drive the French across the Rhine—it would
have been foolish if they had not begun by carefully reviewing the whole
chain of events that success or failure would be likely to bring in
consequence of the initial step, and which would lead to peace. Such a
review was indispensable, both in order to decide how far they could safely
exploit their successes and also how and where any enemy successes could
be arrested.

Careful study of history shows where the difference between these cases

lies. In the eighteenth century, in the days of the Silesian campaigns, war
was still an affair for governments alone, and the people’s role was simply
that of an instrument. At the onset of the nineteenth century, peoples

themselves were in the scale on either side. The generals opposing
Frederick the Great were acting on instructions—which implied that caution
was one of their distinguishing characteristics. But now the opponent of the
Austrians and Prussians was—to put it bluntly—the God of War himself.

about it. In 1805, 1806, and 1809 men might have recognized that total ruin
was a possibility—indeed it stared them in the face. It might have
stimulated them to different efforts that were directed toward greater
objectives than a couple of fortresses and a medium-sized province.

degree of Austrian and Prussian rearmament shows that the storm clouds
massing in the political world had been observed. They failed because the
transformations of war had not yet been sufficiently revealed by history. In
fact the very campaigns of 1805, 1806, and 1809, and those that followed
are the ones that make it easier for us to grasp the concept of modern,
absolute war in all its devastating power.

scope should be determined on the basis of the political probabilities. The
closer these political probabilities drive war toward the absolute, the more
the belligerent states are involved and drawn in to its vortex, the clearer
appear the connections between its separate actions, and the more
imperative the need not to take the first step without considering the last.

B. Scale of the Military Objective and of the Effort To Be Made

Nor are the situation and conditions of the belligerents alike. This can be

a second factor.

Just as disparate are the governments’ strength of will, their character and

abilities.

These three considerations introduce uncertainties that make it difficult to

gauge the amount of resistance to be faced and, in consequence, the means
required and the objectives to be set.

Since in war too small an effort can result not just in failure but in

positive harm, each side is driven to outdo the other, which sets up an
interaction.

Such an interaction could lead to a maximum effort if a maximum could

be defined. But in that case all proportion between action and political
demands would be lost: means would cease to be commensurate with ends,
and in most cases a policy of maximum exertion would fail because of the
domestic problems it would raise.

In this way the belligerent is again driven to adopt a middle course. He

would act on the principle of using no greater force, and setting himself no
greater military aim, than would be sufficient for the achievement of his
political purpose. To turn this principle into practice he must renounce the
need for absolute success in each given case, and he must dismiss remoter
possibilities from his calculations.

At this point, then, intellectual activity leaves the field of the exact

sciences of logic and mathematics. It then becomes an art in the broadest
meaning of the term—the faculty of using judgment to detect the most

important and decisive elements in the vast array of facts and situations.
Undoubtedly this power of judgment consists to a greater or lesser degree in
the intuitive comparison of all the factors and attendant circumstances; what
is remote and secondary is at once dismissed while the most pressing and
important points are identified with greater speed than could be done by
strictly logical deduction.

must first examine our own political aim and that of the enemy. We must
gauge the strength and situation of the opposing state. We must gauge the
character and abilities of its government and people and do the same in
regard to our own. Finally, we must evaluate the political sympathies of
other states and the effect the war may have on them. To assess these things
in all their ramifications and diversity is plainly a colossal task. Rapid and
correct appraisal of them clearly calls for the intuition of a genius; to master
all this complex mass by sheer methodical examination is obviously
impossible. Bonaparte was quite right when he said that Newton himself
would quail before the algebraic problems it could pose.

the proper scale to use, are bound to make it far more difficult to reach the
right conclusion. We should also bear in mind that the vast, unique
importance of war, while not increasing the complexity and difficulty of the
problem, does increase the value of the correct solution. Responsibility and
danger do not tend to free or stimulate the average person’s mind—rather
the contrary; but wherever they do liberate an individual’s judgment and
confidence we can be sure that we are in the presence of exceptional ability.

At the outset, then, we must admit that an imminent war, its possible

aims, and the resources it will require, are matters that can only be assessed
when every circumstance has been examined in the context of the whole,
which of course includes the most ephemeral factors as well. We must also
recognize that the conclusion reached can be no more wholly objective than
any other in war, but will be shaped by the qualities of mind and character
of the men making the decision—of the rulers, statesmen, and commanders,
whether these roles are united in a single individual or not.

A more general and theoretical treatment of the subject may become

feasible if we consider the nature of states and societies as they are

determined by their times and prevailing conditions. Let us take a brief look
at history.

trading cities of the Middle Ages, eighteenth-century kings and the rulers
and peoples of the nineteenth century—all conducted war in their own
particular way, using different methods and pursuing different aims.

women and children, they outnumbered any other army. Their aim was to
subdue their enemies or expel them. If a high degree of civilization could
have been combined with such methods, they would have carried all before
them.

The republics of antiquity, Rome excepted, were small and their armies

smaller still, for the plebs, the mass of the people, was excluded. Being so
many and so close together these republics found that the balance that some
law of nature will always establish among small and unconnected units
formed an obstacle to major enterprises. They therefore limited their wars
to plundering the countryside and seizing a few towns, in order to gain a
degree of influence over them.

Rome was the one exception to this rule, and then only in her later days.

With little bands of men, she had for centuries carried on the usual struggle
with her neighbors for booty or alliance. She grew not so much by conquest
as by the alliances she made, for the neighboring peoples gradually merged
with her and were assimilated into a greater Rome. Only when this process
had spread the rule of Rome through Southern Italy did she begin to expand
by way of actual conquest. Carthage fell; Spain and Gaul were taken;
Greece was subjugated; and Roman rule was carried into Asia and Egypt.
Rome’s military strength at that period was immense, without her efforts
being equally great. Her armies were kept up by her wealth. Rome was no
longer like the Greek republics, nor was she even faithful to her own past.
Her case is unique.

but excellently trained and organized army, Alexander shattered the brittle
states of Asia. Ruthlessly, without pause, he advanced through the vast
expanse of Asia until he reached India. That was something no republic
could have achieved; only a king who in a sense was his own condottiere
could have accomplished it so rapidly.

which limited operations. If a thing could not be finished quickly it was
impossible. The feudal army itself was an assemblage of vassals and their
servants, brought and held together in part by legal obligation, in part by
voluntary alliance—the whole amounting to true confederation. Weapons
and tactics were based on individual combat, and thus unsuited to the
organized action of large numbers. And indeed, cohesion in the state was
never weaker or the individual so independent. It was the combination of
these factors that gave mediaeval wars their special character. They were
waged relatively quickly; not much time was wasted in the field; but their
aim was usually to punish the enemy, not subdue him. When his cattle had
been driven off and his castles burned, one could go home.

They were an expensive and therefore small military force. Even smaller
was their fighting value: extremes of energy or exertion were conspicuous
by their absence and fighting was generally a sham. In brief, then, hatred
and enmity no longer drove the state to take matters into its own hands;
they became an element in negotiation. War lost many of its risks; its
character was wholly changed, and no deduction from its proper nature was
still applicable.

sovereignty. States were closer knit; personal service was commuted into
dues in kind, mostly in the form of money, and feudal levies were replaced
by mercenaries. The transition was bridged by the condottieri. For a period
they were also the instrument of the larger states. But soon the soldier hired
on short-term contract evolved into the permanent mercenary, and the
armed force of the state had become a standing army, paid for by the
treasury.

overlappings of these three types of military institutions. Under Henry IV of
France feudal levies, condottieri and a standing army were used side by
side. The condottieri survived into the Thirty Years War, and indeed faint
traces of them can be found in the eighteenth century.

Just as the character of the military institutions of the European states

differed in the various periods, so did all their other conditions. Europe,
essentially, had broken down into a mass of minor states. Some were

turbulent republics, other precarious small monarchies with very limited
central power. A state of that type could not be said to be genuinely united;
it was rather an agglomeration of loosely associated forces. Therefore we
should not think of such a state as a personified intelligence acting
according to simple and logical rules.

Ages should be considered. One need only think of the German emperors
with their constant descents into Italy over a period of five hundred years.
These expeditions never resulted in any complete conquest of the country;
nor were they ever meant to do so. It would be easy to regard them as a
chronic error, a delusion born of the spirit of the times; but there would be
more sense in attributing them to a host of major causes, which we may
possibly assimilate intellectually, but whose dynamic we will never
comprehend as clearly as did the men who were actually obliged to contend
with them. So long as the great powers that eventually grew out of this
chaos needed time to consolidate and organize themselves, most of their
strength and energies went into that process. Foreign wars were fewer, and
those that did take place betrayed the marks of immature political cohesion.

France could not yet be considered as a genuine monarchy—she was rather
an agglomeration of duchies and counties; while England, though
displaying greater unity, still fought with feudal levies amid much domestic
strife.

became a conquering power in Italy under Charles VIII, and her state and
her army reached a peak under Louis XIV.

Spanish unity began to form under Ferdinand of Aragon. Under Charles

V, as a result of favorable marriages, a mighty Spanish monarchy suddenly
emerged, composed of Spain and Burgundy, Germany and Italy. What this
colossus lacked in cohesion and domestic stability was made up for by its
wealth. Its standing army first encountered that of France. On the abdication
of Charles V the colossus broke into two parts—Spain and Austria. The
latter, strengthened by Hungary and Bohemia, now emerged as a major
power, dragging behind her the German confederation like a dinghy.

The end of the seventeenth century, the age of Louis XIV, may be

regarded as that point in history when the standing army in the shape

familiar to the eighteenth century reached maturity. This military
organization was based on money and recruitment. The states of Europe had
achieved complete internal unity. With their subjects’ services converted
into money payments, the strength of governments now lay entirely in their
treasuries. Thanks to cultural developments and to a progressively more
sophisticated administration, their power was very great compared with
earlier days. France put several hundred thousand regular troops in the field,
and other states could do likewise in proportion to their populations.

now split between a dozen monarchies and a handful of republics. It was
conceivable that two states could fight a major war without, as in former
times, involving twenty others. The possible political alignments were still
many and various; but they could be surveyed, and their probability at each
given instant could be evaluated.

Domestically almost every state had been reduced to an absolute

monarchy; the privileges and influence of the estates had gradually
disappeared. The executive had become completely unified and represented
the state in its foreign relations. Political and military institutions had
developed into an effective instrument, with which an independent will at
the center could now wage war in a form that matched its theoretical
concept.

Adolphus, Charles XII, and Frederick the Great. With relatively limited but
highly efficient forces each sought to turn his small state into a large
monarchy, and crush all opposition. Had they been dealing only with
Asiatic empires they might have resembled Alexander more closely. But in
terms of risks that they ran, they undeniably foreshadowed Bonaparte.

But, if war gained in power and effectiveness, it lost in other respects.
Armies were paid for from the treasury, which rulers treated almost as

their privy purse or at least as the property of the government, not of the
people. Apart from a few commercial matters, relations with other states did
not concern the people but only the treasury or the government. That at
least was the general attitude. A government behaved as though it owned
and managed a great estate that it constantly endeavored to enlarge—an
effort in which the inhabitants were not expected to show any particular
interest. The Tartar people and army had been one; in the republics of

antiquity and during the Middle Ages the people (if we confine the concept
to those who had the rights of citizens) had still played a prominent part;
but in the circumstances of the eighteenth century the people’s part had
been extinguished. The only influence the people continued to exert on war
was an indirect one—through its general virtues or shortcomings.

governments parted company with their peoples and behaved as if they
were themselves the state. Their means of waging war came to consist of
the money in their coffers and of such idle vagabonds as they could lay their
hands on either at home or abroad. In consequence the means they had
available were fairly well defined, and each could gauge the other side’s
potential in terms both of numbers and of time. War was thus deprived of its
most dangerous feature—its tendency toward the extreme, and of the whole
chain of unknown possibilities which would follow.

The enemy’s cash resources, his treasury and his credit, were all

approximately known; so was the size of his fighting forces. No great
expansion was feasible at the outbreak of war. Knowing the limits of the
enemy’s strength, men knew they were reasonably safe from total ruin; and
being aware of their own limitations, they were compelled to restrict their
own aims in turn. Safe from the threat of extremes, it was no longer
necessary to go to extremes. Necessity was no longer an incentive to do so,
and the only impulse could come from courage and ambition. These, on the
other hand, were strongly curbed by the prevailing conditions of the state.
Even a royal commander had to use his army with a minimum of risk. If the
army was pulverized, he could not raise another, and behind the army there
was nothing. That enjoined the greatest prudence in all operations. Only if a
decisive advantage seemed possible could the precious instrument be used,
and to bring things to that point was a feat of the highest generalship. But so
long as that was not achieved, operations drifted in a kind of vacuum; there
was no reason to act, and every motivating force seemed inert. The original
motive of the aggressor faded away in prudence and hesitation.

dealt by time and by accident. In its effect it was a somewhat stronger form
of diplomacy, a more forceful method of negotiation, in which battles and
sieges were the principal notes exchanged. Even the most ambitious ruler

had no greater aims than to gain a number of advantages that could be
exploited at the peace conference.

base on which it rested. But the explanation why even gifted commanders
and monarchs such as Gustavus Adolphus, Charles XII, and Frederick the
Great, with armies of exceptional quality, should have risen so little above
the common level of the times, why even they had to be content with
moderate success, lies with the balance of power in Europe. With the
multitude of minor states in earlier times, any one of them was prevented
from rapidly expanding by such immediate and concrete factors as their
proximity and contiguity, their family ties and personal acquaintances. But
now that states were larger and their centers farther apart, the wide spread
of interests they had developed became the factor limiting their growth.
Political relations, with their affinities and antipathies, had become so
sensitive a nexus that no cannon could be fired in Europe without every
government feeling its interest affected. Hence a new Alexander needed
more than his own sharp sword: he required a ready pen as well. Even so,
his conquests rarely amounted to very much.

Even Louis XIV, though bent on destroying the balance of power in

Europe and little troubled by the general hostility he faced by the end of the
seventeenth century, continued waging war along traditional lines. While
his military instrument was that of the greatest and richest monarch of all,
its character was no different from that of his opponents’.

lay waste the enemy’s land, which had played such an important role in
antiquity, in Tartar days and indeed in mediaeval times. It was rightly held
to be unnecessarily barbarous, an invitation to reprisals, and a practice that
hurt the enemy’s subjects rather than their government—one therefore that
was ineffective and only served permanently to impede the advance of
general civilization. Not only in its means, therefore, but also in its aims,
war increasingly became limited to the fighting force itself. Armies, with
their fortresses and prepared positions, came to form a state within a state,
in which violence gradually faded away.

All Europe rejoiced at this development. It was seen as a logical outcome

of enlightenment. This was a misconception. Enlightenment can never lead
to inconsistency: as we have said before and shall have to say again, it can

never make two and two equal five. Nevertheless this development
benefited the peoples of Europe, although there is no denying that it turned
war even more into the exclusive concern of governments and estranged it
still further from the interests of the people. In those days, an aggressor’s
usual plan of war was to seize an enemy province or two. The defender’s
plan was simply to prevent him doing so. The plan for a given campaign
was to take an enemy fortress or prevent the capture of one’s own. No battle
was ever sought, or fought, unless it were indispensable for that purpose.
Anyone who fought a battle that was not strictly necessity, simply out of
innate desire for victory, was considered reckless. A campaign was usually
spent on a single siege, or two at the most. Winter quarters were assumed to
be necessary for everyone. The poor condition of one side did not constitute
an advantage to the other, and contact almost ceased between both. Winter
quarters set strict limits to the operations of a campaign.

also clearly the weaker of the two, no battle was fought and no town was
besieged. The whole campaign turned on the retention of certain positions
and depots and the systematic exploitation of certain areas.

in such strict and obvious ways, no one saw any inconsistency in it. On the
contrary, it all seemed absolutely right; and when in the eighteenth century
critics began to analyze the art of war, they dealt with points of detail,
without bothering much about fundamentals. Greatness, indeed perfection,
was discerned in many guises, and even the Austrian Field-Marshal Daun—
to whom it was mainly due that Frederick the Great completely attained his
object and Maria Theresa completely failed in hers—could be considered a
great commander. Only from time to time someone of penetrating judgment
—of real common sense—might suggest that with superior forces one
should achieve positive results; otherwise the war, with all its artistry, was
being mismanaged.

Austria and Prussia tried to meet this with the diplomatic type of war that
we have described. They soon discovered its inadequacy. Looking at the
situation in this conventional manner, people at first expected to have to
deal only with a seriously weakened French army; but in 1793 a force
appeared that beggared all imagination. Suddenly war again became the

business of the people—a people of thirty millions, all of whom considered
themselves to be citizens. We need not study in detail the circumstances that
accompanied this tremendous development; we need only note the effects
that are pertinent to our discussion. The people became a participant in war;
instead of governments and armies as heretofore, the full weight of the
nation was thrown into the balance. The resources and efforts now available
for use surpassed all conventional limits; nothing now impeded the vigor
with which war could be waged, and consequently the opponents of France
faced the utmost peril.

the end of the revolutionary wars. The revolutionary quarrels did not yet
advance inevitably toward the ultimate conclusion: the destruction of the
European monarchies. Here and there the German armies were still able to
resist them and stem the tide of victory. But all this was really due only to
technical imperfections that hampered the French, and which became
evident first in the rank and file, then in their generals, and under the
Directory in the government itself.

war, based on the strength of the entire people, began its pulverizing course
through Europe. It moved with such confidence and certainty that whenever
it was opposed by armies of the traditional type there could never be a
moment’s doubt as to the result. Just in time, the reaction set in. The
Spanish War spontaneously became the concern of the people. In 1809 the
Austrian government made an unprecedented effort with reserves and
militia; it came within sight of success and far surpassed everything Austria
had earlier considered possible. In 1812 Russia took Spain and Austria as
models: her immense spaces permitted her measures—belated though they
were—to take effect, and even increased their effectiveness. The result was
brilliant. In Germany, Prussia was first to rise. She made the war a concern
of the people, and with half her former population, without money or credit,
she mobilized a force twice as large as she had in 1806. Little by little the
rest of Germany followed her example, and Austria too—though her effort
did not equal that of 1809—exerted an exceptional degree of energy. The
result was that in 1813 and 1814 Germany and Russia put about a million
men into the field against France—counting all who fought and fell in the
two campaigns.

vigor. Although it did not always match the intensity of the French, and was
at times even marked by timidity, campaigns were on the whole conducted
in the new manner, not in that of the past. In the space of only eight months
the theater of operations changed from the Oder to the Seine. Proud Paris
had for the first time to bow her head, and the terrible Bonaparte lay bound
and chained.

Since Bonaparte, then, war, first among the French and subsequently

among their enemies, again became the concern of the people as a whole,
took on an entirely different character, or rather closely approached its true
character, its absolute perfection. There seemed no end to the resources
mobilized; all limits disappeared in the vigor and enthusiasm shown by
governments and their subjects. Various factors powerfully increased that
vigor: the vastness of available resources, the ample field of opportunity,
and the depth of feeling generally aroused. The sole aim of war was to
overthrow the opponent. Not until he was prostrate was it considered
possible to pause and try to reconcile the opposing interests.

its elemental fury. This was due to the peoples’ new share in these great
affairs of state; and their participation, in turn, resulted partly from the
impact that the Revolution had on the internal conditions of every state and
partly from the danger that France posed to everyone.

Europe be waged with the full resources of the state, and therefore have to
be fought only over major issues that affect the people? Or shall we again
see a gradual separation taking place between government and people?
Such questions are difficult to answer, and we are the last to dare to do so.
But the reader will agree with us when we say that once barriers—which in
a sense consist only in man’s ignorance of what is possible—are torn down,
they are not so easily set up again. At least when major interests are at
stake, mutual hostility will express itself in the same manner as it has in our
own day.

At this point our historical survey can end. Our purpose was not to

assign, in passing, a handful of principles of warfare to each period. We
wanted to show how every age had its own kind of war, its own limiting
conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions. Each period, therefore,

would have held to its own theory of war, even if the urge had always and
universally existed to work things out on scientific principles. It follows
that the events of every age must be judged in the light of its own
peculiarities. One cannot, therefore, understand and appreciate the
commanders of the past until one has placed oneself in the situation of their
times, not so much by a painstaking study of all its details as by an accurate
appreciation of its major determining features.

their armed forces, must contain some more general—indeed, a universal—
element with which every theorist ought above all to be concerned.

The age in which this postulate, this universally valid element, was at its

strongest was the most recent one, when war attained the absolute in
violence. But it is no more likely that war will always be so monumental in
character than that the ample scope it has come to enjoy will again be
severely restricted. A theory, then, that dealt exclusively with absolute war
would either have to ignore any case in which the nature of war had been
deformed by outside influence, or else it would have to dismiss them all as
misconstrued. That cannot be what theory is for. Its purpose is to
demonstrate what war is in practice, not what its ideal nature ought to be.
So the theorist must scrutinize all data with an inquiring, a discriminating,
and a classifying eye. He must always bear in mind the wide variety of
situations that can lead to war. If he does, he will draw the outline of its
salient features in such a way that it can accommodate both the dictates of
the age, and those of the immediate situation.

We can thus only say that the aims a belligerent adopts, and the resources

he employs, must be governed by the particular characteristics of his own
position; but they will also conform to the spirit of the age and to its general
character. Finally, they must always be governed by the general conclusions
to be drawn from the nature of war itself.

Enemy

But what exactly does “defeat” signify? The conquest of the whole of the

enemy’s territory is not always necessary. If Paris had been taken in 1792
the war against the Revolution would almost certainly for the time being
have been brought to an end. There was no need even for the French armies
to have been defeated first, for they were not in those days particularly
powerful. In 1814, on the other hand, even the capture of Paris would not
have ended matters if Bonaparte had still had a sizable army behind him.
But as in fact his army had been largely eliminated, the capture of Paris
settled everything in 1814 and again in 1815. Again, if in 1812 Bonaparte
had managed, before or after taking Moscow, to smash the Russian army,
120,000 strong, on the Kaluga road, just as he smashed the Austrians in
1805 and the Prussians the following year, the fact that he held the capital
would probably have meant that he could make peace in spite of the
enormous area still unoccupied. In 1805 Austerlitz was decisive. The
possession of Vienna and two-thirds of the Austrian territory had not
sufficed to bring about a peace. On the other hand, after Austerlitz the fact
that Hungary was still intact did nothing to prevent peace being made. The
final blow required was to defeat the Russian army; the Czar had no other
near at hand and this victory would certainly have led to peace. Had the
Russian army been with the Austrians on the Danube in 1805 and shared in
their defeat, it would hardly have been necessary to take Vienna; peace
could have been imposed at Linz. Equally, a country’s total occupation may
not be enough. Prussia in 1807 is a case in point. When the blow against the
Russian ally in the uncertain victory of Eylau was not sufficiently decisive,

the decisive victory of Friedland had to be gained in order to achieve what
Austerlitz had accomplished the year before.

Particular factors can often be decisive—details only known to those who
were on the spot. There can also be moral factors which never come to
light; while issues can be decided by chances and incidents so minute as to
figure in histories simply as anecdotes.

What the theorist has to say here is this: one must keep the dominant

characteristics of both belligerents in mind. Out of these characteristics a
certain center of gravity develops, the hub of all power and movement, on
which everything depends. That is the point against which all our energies
should be directed.

Small things always depend on great ones, unimportant on important,

accidentals on essentials. This must guide our approach.

the center of gravity was their army. If the army had been destroyed, they
would all have gone down in history as failures. In countries subject to
domestic strife, the center of gravity is generally the capital. In small
countries that rely on large ones, it is usually the army of their protector.
Among alliances, it lies in the community of interest, and in popular
uprisings it is the personalities of the leaders and public opinion. It is
against these that our energies should be directed. If the enemy is thrown
off balance, he must not be given time to recover. Blow after blow must be
aimed in the same direction: the victor, in other words, must strike with all
his strength and not just against a fraction of the enemy’s. Not by taking
things the easy way—using superior strength to filch some province,
preferring the security of this minor conquest to great success—but by
constantly seeking out the center of his power, by daring all to win all, will
one really defeat the enemy.

the point on which your efforts must converge—the defeat and destruction
of his fighting force remains the best way to begin, and in every case will
be a very significant feature of the campaign.

important for the defeat of the enemy are the following:

1. Destruction of his army, if it is at all significant
2. Seizure of his capital if it is not only the center of administration but

also that of social, professional, and political activity

more powerful than he.

 
Up till now we have assumed—as is generally permissible—that the

enemy is a single power. But having made the point that the defeat of the
enemy consists in overcoming the resistance concentrated in his center of
gravity, we must abandon this assumption and examine the case when there
is more than one enemy to defeat.

If two or more states combine against another, the result is still politically

speaking a single war. But this political unity is a matter of degree. The
question is then whether each state is pursuing an independent interest and
has its own independent means of doing so, or whether the interests and
forces of most of the allies are subordinate to those of the leader. The more
this is the case, the easier will it be to regard all our opponents as a single
entity, hence all the easier to concentrate our principal enterprise into one
great blow. If this is at all feasible it will be much the most effective means
to victory.

I would, therefore, state it as a principle that if you can vanquish all your

enemies by defeating one of them, that defeat must be the main objective in
the war. In this one enemy we strike at the center of gravity of the entire
conflict.

There are very few cases where this conception is not applicable—where

it would not be realistic to reduce several centers of gravity to one. Where
this is not so, there is admittedly no alternative but to act as if there were
two wars or even more, each with its own object. This assumes the
existence of several independent opponents, and consequently great
superiority on their part. When this is the case, to defeat the enemy is out of
the question.

We must now address ourselves more closely to the question: when is

this objective both feasible and sound?

To begin with, our forces must be adequate:

1. To score a decisive victory over the enemy’s

the balance is beyond all possible redress.

 
Next, we must be certain our political position is so secure that this

success will not bring further enemies against us who could force us
immediately to abandon our efforts against our first opponent.

France could annihilate Prussia in 1806 even if this brought down Russia

on her in full force, since she could defend herself against the Russians on
Prussian soil. In 1808 she could do the same in Spain against England; but
in respect of Austria she could not. By 1809, France had to reduce her
forces in Spain considerably, and would have had to relinquish Spain
altogether if she had not already enjoyed a great moral and material
advantage over the Austrians.

These three examples call for careful study. One can win the first

decision in a case but lose it on appeal and end by having to pay costs as
well.

When the strength and capability of armed forces are being calculated,

time is apt to be treated as a factor in total strength on the analogy of
dynamics. It is assumed in consequence that half the effort or half the total
forces could achieve as much in two years as the whole could do in one.
This assumption, which rests, sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly, at
the basis of military planning, is entirely false.

Like everything else in life, a military operation takes time. No one,

obviously, can march from Vilna to Moscow in a week; but here there is no
trace of that reciprocal relationship between time and energy that we would
find in dynamics.

Both belligerents need time; the question is only which of the two can

expect to derive special advantages from it in the light of his own situation.
If the position on each side is carefully considered, the answer will be
obvious: it is the weaker side—but thanks to the laws of psychology rather
than those of dynamics. Envy, jealousy, anxiety, and sometimes perhaps
even generosity are the natural advocates of the unsuccessful. They will win
new friends for him as well as weaken and divide his enemies. Time, then,
is less likely to bring favor to the victor than to the vanquished. There is a
further point to bear in mind. As we have shown elsewhere, the exploitation
of an initial victory requires a major effort. This effort must not only be

made but be sustained like the upkeep of a great household. Conquered
enemy provinces can, of course, bring additional wealth, but they may not
always be enough to meet the additional outlay. If they do not, the strain
will gradually increase and in the end resources may be exhausted. Time is
thus enough to bring about a change unaided.

Poland in 1812 furnish the men by the hundred thousand whom he needed
in Moscow to maintain his position there?

in them vital to the areas still in enemy hands, the rot will spread, like a
cancer, by itself; and if only that and nothing else happens, the conqueror
may well enjoy the net advantage. Time alone will then complete the work,
provided that no help comes from outside, and the area that is still
unconquered may well fall without more ado. Thus time can become a
factor in the conqueror’s strength as well; but only on condition that a
counterattack on him is no longer possible, that no reversal is conceivable
—when indeed this factor is no longer of value since his main objective has
been achieved, the culminating crisis is past, and the enemy, in short, laid
low.

carried out too quickly, and that to spread it over a longer period than the
minimum needed to complete it makes it not less difficult, but more. If that
assertion is correct, it follows equally that if one’s strength in general is
great enough to make a certain conquest one must also have the strength to
do so in a single operation, not by stages. By “stages” naturally, we do not
mean to exclude the minor halts that are needed for reassembling one’s
forces or for administrative reasons.

above all a quick, irresistible decision. If so, we shall have cut the ground
from under the alternative idea that a slow, allegedly systematic occupation
is safer and wiser than conquest by continuous advance. Nonetheless, even
those who have followed us thus far may very likely feel that our views
have an air of paradox, of contradicting first impressions and of
contradicting views that are as deeply rooted as ancient prejudice and that
constantly appear in print. This makes it desirable to examine the alleged
objections in some detail.

It is of course easier to reach a nearby object than a more distant one. But

if the first does not suit our purpose, a pause, a suspension of activity, will
not necessarily make the second half of the journey any easier to complete.
A short jump is certainly easier than a long one: but no one wanting to get
across a wide ditch would begin by jumping half-way.

operations are examined, we will usually find the following:

1. Capture the enemy fortresses in your path.
2. Accumulate the stores you need.
3. Fortify important points like depots, bridges, positions, and so forth.
4. Rest your troops in winter quarters and rest-camps.
5. Wait for next year’s reinforcements.
 
If you halt an offensive altogether and stop the forward movement in

order to make sure of all the above, you allegedly acquire a new base, and
in theory revive your strength as though the whole of your country were
immediately to your rear and the army’s vigor were renewed with each
campaign.

All these are admirable aims, and no doubt they could make offensive

war easier; but they cannot make its results more certain. They usually
camouflage misgivings on the part of the general or vacillation on the part
of the government. We shall now try to roll them up from the left flank.

1. Waiting for reinforcements is just as useful to the other side—if not in

our opinion more. Besides, a country can naturally raise almost as
many troops in one year as in two, for the net increase in the second
year will be very small in relation to the whole.

2. The enemy will rest his troops while we are resting ours.
3. Fortifying towns and positions is no business for the army and

therefore no excuse for suspending operations.

4. Given the way in which armies are supplied today they need depots

more when they are halted than when on the move. So long as the
advance goes properly, enemy supplies will fall into our hands and
make up for any shortage in barren districts.

It is a means of strengthening the advance, and though it causes an
apparent interruption it is not the sort of case we have in mind: it does
not involve a suspension or a reduction of effort. Only circumstances
can decide whether the right procedure is a regular siege, a mere
investment, or simply to keep some fortress or other under
observation. But we can make the general comment that the answer to
this question turns on the answer to another; namely whether it would
be too risky to press on and leave no more than an investing force
behind. If it is not, and if you still have room to deploy your forces, the
right course is to delay a regular siege until all offensive movement is
complete. It is important, therefore, not to give way to the idea of
quickly securing everything you have taken, for fear you end by
missing something more important.

 
Such a further advance, admittedly, does seem to place in jeopardy the

gains already made.
  

Our belief then is that any kind of interruption, pause, or suspension of

activity is inconsistent with the nature of offensive war. When they are
unavoidable, they must be regarded as necessary evils, which make success
not more but less certain. Indeed, if we are to keep strictly to the truth,
when weakness does compel us to halt, a second run at the objective
normally becomes impossible; and if it does turn out to be possible it shows
that there was no need for a halt at all. When an objective was beyond one’s
strength in the first place, it will always remain so.

This seems to us to be generally the case. In drawing attention to it we

desire only to dispose of the idea that time, in itself, can work for the
attacker. But the political situation can change from year to year, and on that
account alone there will often be cases to which this generalization does not
apply.

We may perhaps appear to have forgotten our initial thesis and only

considered offensive war; but this is not so. Certainly a man who can afford
to aim at the enemy’s total defeat will rarely have recourse to the defensive,
the immediate aim of which is the retention of what one has. But we must
insist that defense without an active purpose is self-contradictory both in

strategy and in tactics, and in consequence we must repeat that within the
limits of his strength a defender must always seek to change over to the
attack as soon as he has gained the benefit of the defense. So it follows that
among the aims of such an attack, which is to be regarded as the real aim of
the defense, however significant or insignificant this may be, the defeat of
the enemy could be included. There are situations when the general, even
though he had that grand objective well in mind, yet preferred to start on the
defensive. That this is no mere abstraction is shown by the campaign of
1812. When Emperor Alexander took up arms he may not have dreamed he
would ever completely destroy his enemy—as in the end he did. But would
the idea have been absurd? And would it not have been natural in any case
for the Russians to adopt the defensive at the outset of the war?

Limited Aims

The conditions for defeating an enemy presuppose great physical or

moral superiority or else an extremely enterprising spirit, an inclination for
serious risks. When neither of these is present, the object of military activity
can only be one of two kinds: seizing a small or larger piece of enemy
territory, or holding one’s own until things take a better turn. This latter is
normally the aim of a defensive war.

In considering which is the right course, it is well to remember the phrase

used about the latter, waiting until things take a better turn, which assumes
that there is ground for expecting this to happen. That prospect always
underlies a “waiting” war—that is, a defensive war. The offensive—that is
exploiting the advantages of the moment—is advisable whenever the future
affords better prospects to the enemy than it does to us. A third possibility,
perhaps the most usual, arises when the future seems to promise nothing
definite to either side and hence affords no grounds for a decision.
Obviously, in that case, the offensive should be taken by the side that
possesses the political initiative—that is, the side that has an active purpose,
the aim for which it went to war. If any time is lost without good reason, the
initiator bears the loss.

The grounds we have just defined for choosing offensive or defensive

war have nothing to do with the relative strength of the two sides, although
one might suppose that to be the main consideration. But we believe that if
it were, the wrong decision would result. No one can say the logic of our
simple argument is weak; but does it in practice lead to absurd conclusions?
Supposing that a minor state is in conflict with a much more powerful one

and expects its position to grow weaker every year. If war is unavoidable,
should it not make the most of its opportunities before its position gets still
worse? In short, it should attack—but not because attack in itself is
advantageous (it will on the contrary increase the disparity of strength) but
because the smaller party’s interest is either to settle the quarrel before
conditions deteriorate or at least to acquire some advantages so as to keep
its efforts going. No one could consider this a ludicrous argument. But if the
smaller state is quite certain its enemy will attack, it can and should stand
on the defensive, so as to win the first advantage. By doing so, it will not be
placed at any disadvantage because of the passage of time.

future promises nothing that will influence either side’s decisions. If the
political initiative lies with the smaller power, it should take the military
offensive. Having had the nerve to assume an active role against a stronger
adversary, it must do something definite—in other words, attack the enemy
unless he obliges it by attacking first. Waiting would be absurd, unless the
smaller state had changed its political decision at the moment of executing
its policy. That is what often happens, and partly explains why the
indeterminate character of some wars leaves a student very much perplexed.

are possible: offensive war with a limited aim, and defensive war. We
propose to discuss them in separate chapters. But first there is a further
point to consider.

treated hitherto as deriving only from domestic arguments, and we have
considered the nature of the political aim only to the extent that it has or
does not have an active content. From the point of view of war itself, no
other ingredient of policy is relevant at all. Still, as we argued in the second
chapter of Book One (purpose and means in war), the nature of the political
aim, the scale of demands put forward by either side, and the total political
situation of one’s own side, are all factors that in practice must decisively
influence the conduct of war. We therefore intend to give them special
attention in the following chapter.

OceanofPDF.com

A. The Effect of the Political Aim on the Military Objective

It is traditional in European politics for states to make offensive and

defensive pacts for mutual support—though not to the point of fully
espousing one another’s interests and quarrels. Regardless of the purpose of
the war or the scale of the enemy’s exertions, they pledge each other in
advance to contribute a fixed and usually modest force. A country that
makes this sort of alliance does not consider itself thereby involved in
actual war with anyone, for that would require a formal declaration and
would need a treaty of peace to end it. But even that has never been clearly
settled, and practice in the matter varies.

It would all be tidier, less of a theoretical problem, if the contingent

promised—ten, twenty, or thirty thousand men—were placed entirely at the
ally’s disposal and he were free to use it as he wished. It would then in
effect be a hired force. But that is far from what really happens. The
auxiliary force usually operates under its own commander; he is dependent
only on his own government, and the objective the latter sets him will be as
ambiguous as its aims.

But even when both states are in earnest about making war upon the

third, they do not always say, “we must treat this country as our common
enemy and destroy it, or we shall be destroyed ourselves.” Far from it: the
affair is more often like a business deal. In the light of the risks he expects
and the dividend he hopes for, each will invest about 30,000 to 40,000 men,
and behave as if that were all he stood to lose.

Nor is that attitude peculiar to the case where one state gives another

support in a matter of no great moment to itself. Even when both share a
major interest, action is clogged with diplomatic reservations, and as a rule

the negotiators only pledge a small and limited contingent, so that the rest
can be kept in hand for any special ends the shifts of policy may require.

recent times did the extreme danger emanating from Bonaparte, or his own
unlimited driving power, force people to act in a natural manner. The old
way was a half-and-half affair; it was an anomaly, since in essence war and
peace admit of no gradations. Nevertheless, the old way was no mere
diplomatic archaism that reason could ignore, but a practice deeply rooted
in the frailties and shortcomings of the human race.

Finally, some wars are fought without allies; and, political considerations

will powerfully affect their conduct as well.

only fight until some modest quid pro quo has been acquired, and a
moderate effort should suffice for that. The enemy’s reasoning will be much
the same. But suppose one party or the other finds he has miscalculated,
that he is not, as he had thought, slightly stronger than the enemy, but
weaker. Money and other resources are usually running short and his moral
impulse is not sufficient for a greater effort. In such a case he does the best
he can; he hopes that the outlook will improve although he may have no
ground for such hopes. Meanwhile, the war drags slowly on, like a faint and
starving man.

Thus interaction, the effort to outdo the enemy, the violent and

compulsive course of war, all stagnate for lack of real incentive. Neither
side makes more than minimal moves, and neither feels itself seriously
threatened.

Once this influence of the political objective on war is admitted, as it

must be, there is no stopping it; consequently we must also be willing to
wage such minimal wars, which consist in merely threatening the enemy,
with negotiations held in reserve.

thoroughly scientific. All imperatives inherent in the concept of a war seem
to dissolve, and its foundations are threatened. But the natural solution soon
emerges. As the modifying principle gains a hold on military operations, or
rather, as the incentive fades away, the active element gradually becomes
passive. Less and less happens, and guiding principles will not be needed.
The art of war will shrivel into prudence, and its main concern will be to

make sure the delicate balance is not suddenly upset in the enemy’s favor
and the half-hearted war does not become a real war after all.

B. War Is an Instrument of Policy

It is, of course, well-known that the only source of war is politics—the

intercourse of governments and peoples; but it is apt to be assumed that war
suspends that intercourse and replaces it by a wholly different condition,
ruled by no law but its own.

We maintain, on the contrary, that war is simply a continuation of

political intercourse, with the addition of other means. We deliberately use
the phrase “with the addition of other means” because we also want to make
it clear that war in itself does not suspend political intercourse or change it
into something entirely different. In essentials that intercourse continues,
irrespective of the means it employs. The main lines along which military
events progress, and to which they are restricted, are political lines that
continue throughout the war into the subsequent peace. How could it be
otherwise? Do political relations between peoples and between their
governments stop when diplomatic notes are no longer exchanged? Is war
not just another expression of their thoughts, another form of speech or
writing? Its grammar, indeed, may be its own, but not its logic.

If that is so, then war cannot be divorced from political life; and

whenever this occurs in our thinking about war, the many links that connect

the two elements are destroyed and we are left with something pointless and
devoid of sense.

element of enmity unleashed. All the factors that go to make up war and
determine its salient features—the strength and allies of each antagonist, the
character of the peoples and their governments, and so forth, all the
elements listed in the first chapter of Book I—are these not all political, so
closely connected with political activity that it is impossible to separate the
two? But it is yet more vital to bear all this in mind when studying actual
practice. We will then find that war does not advance relentlessly toward
the absolute, as theory would demand. Being incomplete and self-
contradictory, it cannot follow its own laws, but has to be treated as a part
of some other whole; the name of which is policy.

from the nature of war, bothers little about ultimate possibilities, and
concerns itself only with immediate probabilities. Although this introduces
a high degree of uncertainty into the whole business, turning it into a kind
of game, each government is confident that it can outdo its opponent in skill
and acumen.

mere instrument. It changes the terrible battle-sword that a man needs both
hands and his entire strength to wield, and with which he strikes home once
and no more, into a light, handy rapier—sometimes just a foil for the
exchange of thrusts, feints and parries.

Thus the contradictions in which war involves that naturally timid

creature, man, are resolved; if this is the solution we choose to accept.

becomes more ambitious and vigorous, so will war, and this may reach the
point where war attains its absolute form. If we look at war in this light, we
do not need to lose sight of this absolute: on the contrary, we must
constantly bear it in mind.

we see that all wars are things of the same nature; and this alone will
provide the right criteria for conceiving and judging great designs.

Policy, of course, will not extend its influence to operational details.

Political considerations do not determine the posting of guards or the

employment of patrols. But they are the more influential in the planning of
war, of the campaign, and often even of the battle.

the stage of detailed study it would not have been much help and might
have been distracting. But when plans for a war or a campaign are under
study, this point of view is indispensable.

seeing and judging events, and then adhering to it. One point and one only
yields an integrated view of all phenomena; and only by holding to that
point of view can one avoid inconsistency.

that is, applying first a military, then an administrative eye, then a political,
and so on—the question arises whether policy is bound to be given
precedence over everything.

all aspects of internal administration as well as of spiritual values, and
whatever else the moral philosopher may care to add. Policy, of course, is
nothing in itself; it is simply the trustee for all these interests against other
states. That it can err, subserve the ambitions, private interests, and vanity
of those in power, is neither here nor there. In no sense can the art of war
ever be regarded as the preceptor of policy, and here we can only treat
policy as representative of all interests of the community.

political point of view should give way to the purely military (if a purely
military point of view is conceivable at all): that is, should it disappear
completely or subordinate itself, or should the political point of view
remain dominant and the military be subordinated to it?

war is hardly conceivable unless pure hatred made all wars a struggle for
life and death. In fact, as we have said, they are nothing but expressions of
policy itself. Subordinating the political point of view to the military would
be absurd, for it is policy that has created war. Policy is the guiding
intelligence and war only the instrument, not vice versa. No other
possibility exists, then, than to subordinate the military point of view to the
political.

Chapter 3 above—that the probable character and general shape of any
war should mainly be assessed in the light of political factors and
conditions-and that war should often (indeed today one might say normally)
be conceived as an organic whole whose parts cannot be separated, so that
each individual act contributes to the whole and itself originates in the
central concept, then it will be perfectly clear and certain that the supreme
standpoint for the conduct of war, the point of view that determines its main
lines of action, can only be that of policy.

It is from this point of view, then, that plans are cast, as it were, from a

mold. Judgment and understanding are easier and more natural; convictions
gain in strength, motives in conviction, and history in sense.

political and military interests—not from the nature of the case at any rate
—and should it arise it will show no more than lack of understanding. It
might be thought that policy could make demands on war which war could
not fulfill; but that hypothesis would challenge the natural and unavoidable
assumption that policy knows the instrument it means to use. If policy reads
the course of military events correctly, it is wholly and exclusively entitled
to decide which events and trends are best for the objectives of the war.

In short, at the highest level the art of war turns into policy—but a policy

conducted by fighting battles rather than by sending diplomatic notes.

the plan for one, should be a matter for purely military opinion is
unacceptable and can be damaging. Nor indeed is it sensible to summon
soldiers, as many governments do when they are planning a war, and ask
them for purely military advice. But it makes even less sense for
theoreticians to assert that all available military resources should be put at
the disposal of the commander so that on their basis he can draw up purely
military plans for a war or a campaign. It is in any case a matter of common
experience that despite the great variety and development of modern war its
major lines are still laid down by governments; in other words, if we are to
be technical about it, by a purely political and not a military body.

This is as it should be. No major proposal required for war can be worked

out in ignorance of political factors; and when people talk, as they often do,
about harmful political influence on the management of war, they are not

really saying what they mean. Their quarrel should be with the policy itself,
not with its influence. If the policy is right—that is, successful—any
intentional effect it has on the conduct of the war can only be to the good. If
it has the opposite effect the policy itself is wrong.

effects that are foreign to their nature do political decisions influence
operations for the worse. In the same way as a man who has not fully
mastered a foreign language sometimes fails to express himself correctly, so
statesmen often issue orders that defeat the purpose they are meant to serve.
Time and again that has happened, which demonstrates that a certain grasp
of military affairs is vital for those in charge of general policy.

are far from believing that a minister of war immersed in his files, an
erudite engineer or even an experienced soldier would, simply on the basis
of their particular experience, make the best director of policy—always
assuming that the prince himself is not in control. Far from it. What is
needed in the post is distinguished intellect and strength of character. He
can always get the necessary military information somehow or other. The
military and political affairs of France were never in worse hands than when
the brothers Belle-Isle and the Duc de Choiseul were responsible—good
soldiers though they all were.

If war is to be fully consonant with political objectives, and policy suited

to the means available for war, then unless statesman and soldier are
combined in one person, the only sound expedient is to make the
commander-in-chief a member of the cabinet, so that the cabinet can share
in the major aspects of his activities.122 But that, in turn, is only feasible if
the cabinet—that is, the government—is near the theater of operations, so
that decisions can be taken without serious loss of time. That is what the
Austrian Emperor did in 1809, and the allied sovereigns in 1813-1815. The
practice justified itself perfectly.

What is highly dangerous is to let any soldier but the commander-in-chief

exert an influence in cabinet. It very seldom leads to sound vigorous action.
The example of France between 1793 and 1795, when Carnot ran the war
from Paris, is entirely inapplicable, for terror can be used as a weapon only
by a revolutionary government.

Let us conclude with some historical observations.
In the last decade of the eighteenth century, when that remarkable change

in the art of war took place, when the best armies saw part of their doctrine
become ineffective and military victories occurred on a scale that up to then
had been inconceivable, it seemed that all mistakes had been military
mistakes. It became evident that the art of war, long accustomed to a narrow
range of possibilities, had been surprised by options that lay beyond this
range, but that certainly did not go against the nature of war itself.

general influence that policy had for centuries exerted, to its serious
detriment, on the art of war, turning it into a half-and-half affair and often
into downright make-believe. The facts were indeed as they saw them; but
they were wrong to regard them as a chance development that could have
been avoided. Others thought the key to everything was in the influence of
the policies that Austria, Prussia, England and the rest were currently
pursuing.

But is it true that the real shock was military rather than political? To put

it in the terms of our argument, was the disaster due to the effect of policy
on war, or was policy itself at fault?

caused not so much by new military methods and concepts as by radical
changes in policies and administration, by the new character of government,
altered conditions of the French people, and the like. That other
governments did not understand these changes, that they wished to oppose
new and overwhelming forces with customary means: all these were
political errors. Would a purely military view of war have enabled anyone
to detect these faults and cure them? It would not. Even if there really had
existed a thoughtful strategist capable of deducing the whole range of
consequences simply from the nature of the hostile elements, and on the
strength of these of prophesying their ultimate effects, it would have been
quite impossible to act on his speculations.

emerged in France, and had grasped that new political conditions now
obtained in Europe, could they foresee the broad effect all this would have
on war; and only in that way could they appreciate the scale of the means
that would have to be employed, and how best to apply them.

mainly due to the mistaken policies of France’s enemies.

wars, which thoroughly disappointed all political expectations that had been
placed on them. But the trouble was not that the statesmen had ignored the
soldiers’ views. The military art on which the politicians relied was part of
a world they thought was real—a branch of current statecraft, a familiar tool
that had been in use for many years. But that form of war naturally shared
in the errors of policy, and therefore could provide no corrective. It is true
that war itself has undergone significant changes in character and methods,
changes that have brought it closer to its absolute form. But these changes
did not come about because the French government freed itself, so to speak,
from the harness of policy; they were caused by the new political conditions
which the French Revolution created both in France and in Europe as a
whole, conditions that set in motion new means and new forces, and have
thus made possible a degree of energy in war that otherwise would have
been inconceivable.

transformation of politics. So far from suggesting that the two could be
disassociated from each other, these changes are a strong proof of their
indissoluble connection.

character of policy and measure by its standards. The conduct of war, in its
great outlines, is therefore policy itself, which takes up the sword in place
of the pen, but does not on that account cease to think according to its own
laws.

The point of such a conquest is to reduce his national resources. We thus

reduce his fighting strength and increase our own. As a result we fight the
war partly at his expense. At the peace negotiations, moreover, we will have
a concrete asset in hand, which we can either keep or trade for other
advantages.

This is a very natural view to take of conquered territory, the only

drawback being the necessity of defending that territory once we have
occupied it, which might be a source of some anxiety.

In the chapter on the culminating point of victory123 we dealt at some

length with the way in which an offensive weakens the attacking force, and
showed how a situation might develop that could give rise to serious
consequences.

Capturing enemy territory will reduce the strength of our forces in

varying degrees, which are determined by the location of the occupied
territory. If it adjoins our own—either as an enclave within our territory or
adjoining it—the more directly it lies on the line of our main advance, the
less our strength will suffer. Saxony in the Seven Years War was a natural
extension of the Prussian theater, and its occupation by Frederick the Great
made his forces stronger instead of weaker; for Saxony is nearer Silesia
than it is to the Mark, and covers both of them.

Even the conquest of Silesia in 1740 and 1741, once completed, was no

strain on Frederick’s strength on account of its shape and location and the
contour of its frontiers. So long as Saxony was not in Austrian hands,
Silesia offered Austria only a narrow frontier, which in any case lay on the
route that either side would have to take in advancing.

ground on either side, if its position is not central and its configuration
awkward, its occupation will become so plain a burden as to make an
enemy victory not just easier but perhaps superfluous. Every time the
Austrians invaded Provence from Italy they were forced to give it up
without any fighting. In 1744 the French thanked God for allowing them to
leave Bohemia without having suffered a defeat. Frederick in 1758 found it
impossible to hold his ground in Bohemia and Moravia with the same force
that had fought so brilliantly the previous year in Silesia and Saxony. Of
armies that had to give up some captured territory just because its conquest
had so weakened them, examples are so common that we need not trouble
to quote any more of them.

whether one can be sure of holding it or, if not, whether a temporary
occupation (by way of invasion or diversion) will really be worth the cost of
the operation and, especially, whether there is any risk of being strongly
counterattacked and thrown off balance. In the chapter on the culminating
point, we emphasized how many factors need to be considered in each
particular case.

appropriate to make up for losses elsewhere. While we are busy occupying
one area, the enemy may be doing the same somewhere else. If our project
is not of overwhelming significance, it will not compel the enemy to give
up his own conquest. Thorough consideration is therefore necessary in
order to decide whether on balance we will gain or lose.

gains from conquering his territory, even if the value of both areas should
be identical. The reason is that a whole range of resources are denied to us.
But since this is also the case with the enemy, it ought not to be a reason for
thinking that retention is more important than conquest. Yet this is so. The
retention of one’s own territory is always a matter of more direct concern,
and the damage that our state suffers may be balanced and so to speak
neutralized only if retaliation promises sufficient advantage—that is to say
the gains are substantially greater.

It follows from all this that a strategic attack with a limited objective is

directly cover—far more burdened than it would be if aimed at the heart of
the enemy’s power. The effect is to limit the scale on which forces can be
concentrated, both in time and in space.

offensive must be launched from every practicable point at once. Then,
however, the attack loses the other advantage of being able to stay on the
defensive here and there and thus make do with a much smaller force. The
net result of having such a limited objective is that everything tends to
cancel out. We cannot then put all our strength into a single massive blow,
aimed in accordance with our major interest. Effort is increasingly
dispersed; friction everywhere increases and greater scope is left for chance.

That is how events tend to develop, dragging the commander down,

frustrating him more and more. The more conscious he is of his own
powers, the greater his self-confidence, the larger the forces he commands,
then the more he will seek to break loose from this tendency, in order to
give some one point a preponderant importance, even if this should be
possible only by running greater risks.

No doubt that end could in theory be pursued by wearing the enemy

down. He has the positive aim, and any unsuccessful operation, even
though it only costs the forces that take part in it, has the same effect as a
retreat. But the defender’s loss is not incurred in vain: he has held his
ground, which is all he meant to do. For the defender then, it might be said,
his positive aim is to hold what he has. That might be sound if it were sure
that a certain number of attacks would actually wear the enemy down and
make him desist. But this is not necessarily so. If we consider the relative
exhaustion of forces on both sides, the defender is at a disadvantage. The
attack may weaken, but only in the sense that a turning point may occur.
Once that possibility is gone, the defender weakens more than the attacker,
for two reasons. For one thing, he is weaker anyway, and if losses are the
same on both sides, it is he who is harder hit. Second, the enemy will
usually deprive him of part of his territory and resources. In all this we can
find no reason for the attacker to desist. We are left with the conclusion that
if the attacker sustains his efforts while his opponent does nothing but ward
them off, the latter can do nothing to neutralize the danger that sooner or
later an offensive thrust will succeed.

Certainly the exhaustion or, to be accurate, the fatigue of the stronger has

often brought about peace. The reason can be found in the half-hearted
manner in which wars are usually waged. It cannot be taken in any
scientific sense as the ultimate, universal objective of all defense.

Only one hypothesis remains: that the aim of the defense must embody

the idea of waiting—which is after all its leading feature. The idea implies,

moreover, that the situation can develop, that in itself it may improve,
which is to say that if improvement cannot be effected from within—that is,
by sheer resistance—it can only come from without; and an improvement
from without implies a change in the political situation. Either additional
allies come to the defender’s help or allies begin to desert his enemy.

serious counterattack. But according to the concept of the defense that we
have formulated, this does not always apply. We have argued that the
defensive is the more effective form of war, and because of this
effectiveness it can also be employed to execute a counteroffensive on
whatever scale.

has its effect on the conduct of the defense.

inviolate, and to hold it for as long as possible. That will gain him time, and
gaining time is the only way he can achieve his aim. The positive aim, the
most he can achieve, the one that will get him what he wants from the peace
negotiations, cannot yet be included in his plan of operations. He has to
remain strategically passive, and the only success he can win consists in
beating off attacks at given points. These small advantages can then be used
to strengthen other points, for pressure may be severe at all of them. If he
has no chance of doing so, his only profit is the fact that the enemy will not
trouble him again for a while.

That sort of defense can include minor offensive operations without their

altering its nature or purpose. They should not aim at permanent
acquisitions but at the temporary seizure of assets that can be returned at a
later date. They can take the form of raids or diversions, perhaps the capture
of some fortress or other, but always on condition that sufficient forces can
be spared from their defensive role.

The second category exists where the defense has already assumed a

positive purpose. It then acquires an active character that comes to the fore
in proportion as the scale of feasible counterattack expands. To put it in
another way: the more the defensive was deliberately chosen in order to
make certain of the first round, the more the defender can take risks in
laying traps for the enemy. Of these, the boldest and, if it works, the

deadliest, is to retire into the interior. Such an expedient, nonetheless, could
hardly be more different from the first type of defensive.

Seven Years War and the situation of Russia in 1812. When war broke out,
Frederick’s readiness for it gave him some advantage. It meant he could
conquer Saxony—such a natural extension of his theater of war that its
occupation put no strain upon his forces, but augmented them. In the
campaign of 1757 he sought to continue and develop his strategic offensive,
which was not impossible so long as the Russians and the French had not
arrived in Silesia, the Mark, and Saxony. But the offensive failed; he was
thrown back on the defensive for the rest of the campaign, abandoning
Bohemia and having to clear his own base of operations of the enemy. That
required the use of the same army to deal first with the French and then124

with the Austrians. What successes he achieved he owed to the defensive.

By 1758, when his enemies had drawn the noose more tightly round him

and his forces were becoming seriously outnumbered, he still planned a
limited offensive in Moravia; he aimed at seizing Olmütz before his
adversaries were in the field. He did not hope to hold it, still less to make it
a base for a further advance, but simply to use it as a sort of outwork, as a
contre-approche against the Austrians, designed to make them spend the
rest of the campaign, and possibly a second year’s, in trying to retake it.
That effort was a failure too, and Frederick now abandoned any thought of a
serious offensive, realizing that it would still further reduce his relative
strength. A compact position in the center of his territories, in Silesia and
Saxony, exploitation of interior lines for quickly reinforcing any danger
point, small raids as opportunities occurred, quietly waiting meanwhile on
events so as to economize his strength for better times—such were the main
elements in his plans. Gradually, his operations became more passive.
Realizing that even victories cost too much, he tried to manage with less.
His one concern was to gain time, and hold on to what he had. Less and less
was he willing to give ground and he did not scruple to adopt a thorough-
going cordon-system; both Prince Henry’s positions in Saxony and those of
the King in the mountains of Silesia deserve this description. His letters to
the Marquis d’Argens125 show how keenly he looked forward to winter

quarters and how much he hoped he would be able to take them up without
incurring serious losses in the meantime.

morale, would in our view be a very superficial judgment. Devices such as
the entrenched camp at Bunzelwitz, the positions that Prince Henry chose in
Saxony and the King in the Silesian mountains, may not seem to us today
the sort of measure on which to place one’s final hope—tactical cobwebs
that a man like Bonaparte would soon have cleared away. But one must
remember that times have changed, that war has undergone a total
transformation and now draws life from wholly different sources. Positions
that have lost all value today could be effective then; and the enemy’s
general character was a factor as well. Methods which Frederick himself
discounted could be the highest degree of wisdom when used against the
Austrian and Russian forces under men like Daun and Buturlin.

This view was justified by success. By quietly waiting on events

Frederick achieved his goal and avoided difficulties that would have
shattered his forces.

opposed the French was even less adequate than Frederick’s at the outset of
the Seven Years War. But the Russians could expect to grow much stronger
in the course of the campaign. At heart, all Europe was opposed to
Bonaparte; he had stretched his resources to the very limit; in Spain he was
fighting a war of attrition; and the vast expanse of Russia meant that an
invader’s strength could be worn down to the bone in the course of five
hundred miles’ retreat. Tremendous things were possible; not only was a
massive counterstroke a certainty if the French offensive failed (and how
could it succeed if the Czar would not make peace nor his subjects rise
against him?) but the counterstroke could bring the French to utter ruin. The
highest wisdom could never have devised a better strategy than the one the
Russians followed unintentionally.

No one thought so at the time, and such a view would have seemed far-

fetched; but that is no reason for refusing to admit today that it was right. If
we wish to learn from history, we must realize that what happened once can
happen again; and anyone with judgment in these matters will agree that the
chain of great events that followed the march on Moscow was no mere
succession of accidents. To be sure, had the Russians been able to put up

any kind of defense of their frontiers, the star of France would probably
have waned, and luck would probably have deserted her; but certainly not
on that colossal and decisive scale. It was a vast success; and it cost the
Russians a price in blood and perils that for any other country would have
been higher still, and which most could not have paid at all.

A major victory can only be obtained by positive measures aimed at a

decision, never by simply waiting on events. In short, even in the defense, a
major stake alone can bring a major gain.

Enemy

The first principle is that the ultimate substance of enemy strength must

be traced back to the fewest possible sources, and ideally to one alone. The
attack on these sources must be compressed into the fewest possible actions
—again, ideally, into one. Finally, all minor actions must be subordinated as
much as possible. In short the first principle is: act with the utmost
concentration.

The second principle is: act with the utmost speed. No halt or detour

must be permitted without good cause.

The task of reducing the sources of enemy strength to a single center of

gravity will depend on:

1. The distribution of the enemy’s political power. If it lies in the armed

forces of a single government, there will normally be no problem. If it
is shared among allied armies, one of which is simply acting as an ally
without a special interest of its own, the task is hardly any greater. But
if it is shared among allies bound together by a common interest, the
problem turns on the cordiality of the alliance. We have dealt with this
earlier.

2. The situation in the theater of war where the various armies are

operating. If all enemy forces are concentrated in a single army in one
theater of war they in fact constitute a unity, and the question need not

be pursued. But if the enemy in a single theater consists of separate
allied armies, their unity is less than absolute; yet they will still be
sufficiently integrated for a resolute attack on one to involve the rest. If
the armies operate in neighboring theaters with no great natural
barriers between them, one of them can still have a decisive influence
on the others; but with theaters far apart, with neutral territory or
mountain ranges in between, the influence in question will be doubtful
—in fact, improbable—and if the theaters lie at opposite ends of the
country under attack and operations directed against them therefore
have to take divergent lines, they will almost cease to be related.

 
Should Prussia be attacked by France and Russia simultaneously the

effect on the conduct of operations would be as if there were two separate
wars. Only at the peace negotiations might their essential unity become
clear.

Conversely, in the Seven Years War the Austrian and Saxon forces were

practically fused: they shared one another’s fortunes, partly because from
Frederick’s point of view their theaters both lay in the same direction, and
partly because of Saxony’s total lack of political independence.

Numerous though the enemies were with whom Bonaparte had to

contend in 1813, they all faced him from more or less the same direction.
Their various operational zones were closely linked and interacted strongly
on each other. Had he been able to concentrate his forces at one point and
destroy his principal enemy, the fate of the rest would have been decided as
well. Had he beaten the main allied army in Bohemia and pressed on via
Prague to Vienna, Blücher could not with the best will in the world have
remained in Saxony. He would have been summoned to help in Bohemia,
and the Crown Prince of Sweden would certainly have lacked the will to
remain in the Mark Brandenburg.

Should Austria, on the other hand, make war on France both in Italy and

on the Rhine, she will always find it hard to produce a decision in both
theaters by striking a successful blow in one of them. For one thing, the
Alps are too great a barrier and besides, the roads from Austria to the Rhine
and Italy diverge. France would have a somewhat easier task. In either case
her lines of attack would converge upon Vienna and the core of the Austrian
monarchy, and a decisive victory in one theater would be decisive for the

other as well. We should add that if France were to strike a decisive blow in
Italy it would have more effect on the Rhenish theater than the other way
about. An offensive launched from Italy would threaten the center of
Austrian power, while operations from the Rhine would threaten only one
of its wings.

power runs through every level of operations, and thus the effect that events
in a given theater will have elsewhere can only be judged in each particular
case. Only then can it be seen how far the enemy’s various centers of
gravity can be reduced to one.

admits of only one exception—that is, when secondary operations look
exceptionally rewarding. But we must repeat that only decisive superiority
can justify diverting strength without risking too much in the principal
theater.

When General Bülow marched into Holland in 1814 it was on the

assumption that his 30,000 men would not only neutralize an equal number
of the French, but would also enable the Dutch and English to put forces in
the field that otherwise could not have been brought to bear.

The first task, then, in planning for a war is to identify the enemy’s

centers of gravity, and if possible trace them back to a single one.

The second task is to ensure that the forces to be used against that point

are concentrated for a main offensive.

In this situation we may be faced with the following reasons for dividing

our forces:

1. The original disposition of the forces—and therefore also the

geographical location of the attacking states.

 
If concentration would entail detours and loss of time, and if the risks of

advancing separately are not too great, one can justify such a course. If a
laborious junction were effected needlessly and at great cost in time, and
the first assault were, therefore, made with less than maximum élan and
speed, it would violate our second general principle. This deserves
particular consideration whenever there is a chance to surprise the enemy.

who are placed not one behind the other but facing the enemy side by side.
If Prussia and Austria were fighting France, to make both armies start from
the same place would waste a great deal of time and strength. The natural
route for Prussia to the heart of France is from the lower Rhine, and for
Austria from the upper Rhine. It follows that no junction could be made
without some sacrifice, and so in any given case the question is whether this
sacrifice need be made.

2. An attack on separate lines may promise greater results.

implies a concentric attack. A divided attack on parallel or divergent lines
would be classified as a secondary operation, which we have discussed
already.

Both in strategy and in tactics a convergent attack always holds out

promise of increased results, for if it succeeds the enemy is not just beaten;
he is virtually cut off. The convergent attack, then, is always the more
promising; but since forces are divided and the theater is enlarged, it also
carries a greater risk. As with the attack and defense, the weaker form
promises the greater success.

All depends, therefore, on whether the attacker feels strong enough to go

after such a prize.

In 1757, when Frederick decided to invade Bohemia, he split his forces

between Saxony and Silesia. He had two main reasons. First, that was
where his forces had been deployed for the winter, and a concentration of
forces would have deprived the attack of surprise. Second, his concentric
advance threatened both Austrian theaters in flank and rear. The risk he ran
was that one of his armies might be defeated by superior strength. If the
Austrians failed to appreciate this, they would have either to accept battle in
the center, or allow themselves to be maneuvered right off their line of
communication by one flank or the other until they met disaster. That was
the greatest success which this advance promised the King. In fact, the
Austrians opted for battle in the center; but they took up positions at
Prague, which was far too exposed to the enveloping attack, and their
inactivity gave the attack the time it needed to produce its maximum effect.

The result was that their defeat turned into a true catastrophe—as is proved
by the fact that the commanding general and two thirds of the army was
shut up in Prague.

willingness to risk a concentric attack. Who could criticize Frederick for
trusting that the precision of his movements, his generals’ vigor and his
army’s high morale, in contrast to the Austrians’ obtuseness, were sufficient
to guarantee success? It would be wrong to leave out these moral factors
and imagine the geometric form of the attack was all that mattered. One
only has to compare it with Bonaparte’s no less brilliant campaign of 1796,
when the Austrians were signally punished for their converging advance
into Italy. Leaving aside the moral factor, the resources that the French
general had at his command on that occasion were no greater than the
Austrian had available in 1757. Indeed, they were less, for the Austrian
commander, unlike Bonaparte, was not his enemy’s inferior in strength.
Hence, if there is reason to fear that a divided and convergent thrust will
give the enemy a chance to equalize his strength by using his interior lines,
it is better not employed. If the deployment of the forces makes it essential,
it must be regarded as a necessary evil.

which France was invaded in 1814. The Russian, Austrian, and Prussian
armies were all assembled at Frankfurt, on the obvious and most direct
route to France’s center of gravity. They were then split up so that one army
should invade from Mainz and the other should first pass through
Switzerland. France’s military strength at that time was so low that there
was no question of her defending her frontiers: hence the only point of a
convergent invasion was that if all went well one army would take Lorraine
and Alsace while the Franche-Comté fell to the other. Was this meager
advantage worth the trouble of marching through Switzerland? We know
quite well that there were other equally bad grounds on which that march
was ordered, but we mention the one most relevant to our discussion.

1796 that he knew exactly how to deal with a convergent threat, and though
he might be seriously outnumbered, everyone was ready to admit from the
start that morally he was far superior. Late in joining his army at Chalons
and generally underrating his opponents, he almost managed to strike the

two armies separately before they joined up. Yet how weak they were when
he met them at Brienne! Out of 65,000 men, Blücher had only 27,000 with
him, and of the 200,000 men of the main army only 100,000 were available.

from the very moment the advance began the allied armies wanted nothing
more than to link up again.

After all these considerations, we believe that while an attack on

convergent lines is in itself a means toward success, nevertheless in general
it should occur only as the result of the original deployment of forces, and it
seldom justifies departing from the shortest and simplest line of advance.

3. The extent of a theater of war can constitute a ground for advancing

with divided forces.

thrusting deeper into enemy territory, the area that it dominates is not
strictly limited to the roads it uses but extends a certain distance on either
side. But its breadth will very much depend (if we may use such a
metaphor) on the solidity and cohesion of the opposing state. If the enemy
country is rather loosely knit, if its people are soft and have forgotten what
war is like, a triumphant invader will have no great trouble in leaving a
wide swathe of country safely in his rear; but if he is faced with a brave and
loyal populace the area of safety will resemble a narrow triangle.

To avoid that risk he must contrive to advance on a broader front, and if

the enemy’s strength is concentrated at one point the invader can only
maintain this breadth until contact is made. On approaching the enemy
position it has to be reduced. That is self-evident.

But if the enemy position itself extends over a certain breadth it would be

sensible to extend one’s own front to the same degree. We have in mind a
single operational theater or several adjacent ones, and our remarks will
therefore obviously apply no less to cases where the main offensive
automatically settles all lesser issues.

But can that always be relied upon? Can one afford the risks that will

arise if the influence of the main objective on the minor ones is not enough?
Perhaps we should look more closely at this requirement, that a theater of
operations ought to have a certain breadth.

arise; but we maintain that the decision on the main objective will, with few
exceptions, carry the minor ones as well. That is the principle on which
action should invariably be based unless there are obvious reasons to the
contrary.

principal Russian army the success would sweep away the Russian forces
on the upper Dwina too. Oudinot’s corps was all he left initially to deal with
these; but Wittgenstein attacked, and Bonaparte then had to send the Sixth
Corps there as well.

with Bagration; but the withdrawal of the Russian center swept Bagration
away and enabled Bonaparte to recall the force he had detached. Had
Wittgenstein not been obliged to cover the second capital126 he too would
have followed the retreat of the main army under Barclay.

Bonaparte’s victories at Ulm and Regensburg in 1805 and 1809 also

settled the fate of Italy and the Tyrol, though Italy was a rather distant
autonomous theater. Jena and Auerstädt in 1806 put an end to any threat
that might have arisen in Westphalia, in Hesse or on the Frankfurt road.

Among the many factors that may influence resistance at subordinate

points, two are particularly significant.

The first is that in a country so vast and relatively powerful as Russia, the

decisive blow at the vital point may be long delayed and there is no need for
a rapid concentration of all one’s forces.

The second factor emerges when numerous fortresses confer unusual

autonomy on a secondary area, as for example Silesia in 1806. Nevertheless
Bonaparte imputed very little importance to it; and although he had to by-
pass Silesia on his advance to Warsaw, he detached only his brother Jérome
and 20,000 men to deal with it.

If it seems probable in any given case that the attack on the main

objective will not shake the minor ones, or if it has already failed to do so;
if the enemy has already committed forces at those points, it will then be
necessary to despatch another and more adequate force to deal with them,
since lines of communication cannot be left entirely unprotected.

against the main objective should keep strictly in step with advances against
the minor ones, so that whenever the enemy refuses to give way at other
points, the main advance is halted.

maximum concentration against the main objective; but the spirit
underlying it is wholly contrary. It would impose such sluggishness on
movement, such paralysis on the attack, create such opportunities for
chance and waste so much time, as in fact to be wholly incompatible with
an offensive aimed at defeating the enemy.

from these minor points along divergent lines. What would then become of
the unity of our attack?

attack dependent on minor operations, and instead assert that an offensive
intending the enemy’s collapse will fail if it does not dare to drive like an
arrow at the heart of the enemy state.

4. A fourth and final ground for advancing with divided forces may be to

reduce the problems of supply.

prosperous area than a powerful army through a poor one; but the latter is
not impossible if proper arrangements are made and the army is accustomed
to privation. The former option should therefore not have so much influence
on plans as to justify taking greater risks.

We have now dealt with the grounds that justify dividing forces and

splitting one operation into several. If such a division were made on one of
those grounds with a clear idea of its purpose and after careful weighing of
the pros and cons, we should not presume to criticize it.

But when the usual thing occurs, and a “trained” general staff makes such

a plan as a matter of routine, and when all the various operational theaters
have to be occupied, like squares on a chessboard, each with the appropriate
units before the actual moves begin; when the moves themselves are made
with self-styled expertise to reach their goal by devious routes and
combinations; when modern armies have to separate in order to display

“consummate art” by reuniting two weeks later at the utmost risk: then we
can only say we abhor this departure from the straight, simple, easy
approach in order to plunge deliberately into confusion. Such idiocy
becomes the more likely, the less the war is run by the commander-in-chief
himself in the manner indicated in our opening chapter: that is, as a single
activity of an individual invested with huge powers; or, in other words, the
more the plan as a whole is cooked up by an unrealistic general staff on the
recipes of half-a-dozen amateurs.

The third part of our first principle has still to be considered: namely to

keep each minor operation as subordinate as possible.

If one seeks to concentrate all military action on a single goal, and if so

far as possible a single massive operation is envisaged as the means of
gaining it, the other points at which the opponents are in contact must lose
part of their independence and become subordinate operations. If absolutely
everything could be concentrated into one action, those other contact points
would be completely neutralized. But that is rarely possible; so the problem
is to hold them strictly within bounds and make sure they do not draw off
too much strength from the main operation.

even when the enemy’s whole resistance cannot be reduced to a single
center of gravity and when, as we have once put it, two almost wholly
separate wars have to be fought simultaneously. Even then one of them
must be treated as the main operation, calling for the bulk of resources and
of activities.

Seen in this light, it is advisable to operate offensively only in this main

theater and to stay on the defensive elsewhere. There an attack will only be
justified if exceptional conditions should invite it. Moreover the defensive
at the minor points should be maintained with the minimum of strength; and
every advantage that that form of resistance offers should be turned to
account.

which several enemy allied armies are engaged in such a way that they are
all affected when the common center of gravity is struck.

Against the enemy who is the target of the main offensive there can

therefore be no such thing as a defensive in subsidiary theaters of
operations. That offensive consists of the main attack and such subsidiary

attacks as circumstances make necessary. This removes all need to defend
any point that the offensive does not itself directly cover. The main decision
is what matters. It will compensate for any loss. If the forces are sufficient
to make it reasonable to seek a major decision, then the possibility of failure
can no longer be an excuse for trying to cover oneself everywhere else. For
this would make defeat in the decisive battle that much more probable, and
would thus introduce an element of contradiction into our actions.

same priority must also be applied to all its parts. Which forces from each
theater shall advance toward the common center of gravity is usually
decided on extraneous grounds; all we are saying, therefore, is that there
must be an effort to make sure the main operation has precedence. The
more that precedence is realized, the simpler everything will be and the less
will it be left to chance.

The second principle is the rapid use of our forces.
Any unnecessary expenditure of time, every unnecessary detour, is a

waste of strength and thus abhorrent to strategic thought. It is still more
important to remember that almost the only advantage of the attack rests on
its initial surprise. Speed and impetus are its strongest elements and are
usually indispensable if we are to defeat the enemy.

about moving left or right, doing this or that, are otiose.

If we recall what was said in the chapter127 on the aims of strategic

attack, and the part in Chapter Four above about the influence of time, we
believe no further elaboration is needed to show that this principle should
be given the priority that we claim for it.

Bonaparte never forgot it. He always preferred the shortest road between

one army and another, or between two capitals.

Now, what constitutes the main operation, which we have made central to

all else, and for which we have demanded such rapid and straightforward
execution?

In Chapter Four we explained what we mean by the defeat of the enemy,

to the extent this can be done in general terms, and there is no need to
repeat it. Whatever the final act may turn on in any given case, the
beginning is invariably the same—annihilation of the enemy’s armed

forces, which implies a major victory and their actual destruction. The
earlier this victory can be sought—that is, the nearer to our frontiers—the
easier it will be. The later the main battle is fought—that is, the deeper in
enemy territory—the more decisive its effect. Here, as everywhere, the ease
of success and its magnitude are in balance.

the enemy’s main force must be sought out if possible. We say “if possible”
because if it involved substantial detours, taking the wrong road and
wasting time, this could easily prove a mistake. If the enemy’s main force is
not on our line of advance, and if other reasons make it impossible for us to
seek it out, we are bound to find it later, since it cannot fail eventually to
oppose us. Then, as we have just argued, the battle is fought under less
favorable circumstances—a disadvantage we must accept. Nevertheless, if
we win the battle, our victory will be the more decisive.

From this it follows that if in this hypothetical case, the enemy’s main

army lies across our line of advance, it would be wrong deliberately to by-
pass him; at least, if our motive in so doing is to make our victory easier.
On the other hand, the premises suggest that we can avoid the enemy
provided we are massively superior, in order to make our ultimate victory
more decisive.

won, but the complete defeat of the enemy. Such a victory demands an
enveloping attack or a battle with reversed fronts, either of which will
always make the result decisive. It is essential, then, that any plan of
operations should provide for this, both as regards the forces it requires and
the direction to be given them. We shall say more about this in our chapter
on the planning of a campaign.128

It is not impossible, of course, for a battle to end in total victory even if

fought with parallel fronts, and military history can show examples: but
such cases are rare and are growing rarer as armies approximate to one
another in training and in skill. Twenty-one battalions are not captured in a
single village nowadays as they were at Blenheim.

Once a major victory is achieved there must be no talk of rest, of a

breathing space, of reviewing the position or consolidating and so forth, but
only of the pursuit, going for the enemy again if necessary, seizing his

whether to besiege them or not will depend upon our strength. If our
superiority is very great, we will lose less time by taking them as early as
we can; but if we are not so sure that fresh successes lie ahead, we must
invest them with the smallest possible forces that precludes all thought of
regularly besieging them. From the moment when the siege of fortresses
compels us to suspend the advance, the offensive has as a rule reached its
culminating point. Therefore we demand that the main force should go on
advancing rapidly and keep up the pressure. We have already disposed of
the idea that an advance toward the main objective should be made to wait
upon success at minor points. Hence the main force, as a rule, will leave no
more than a narrow band of territory in its rear, which it can call its own and
which forms its theater of operations. This can check momentum at the
front, as we have seen, and involve some risks for the attacker. It is a
problem: might these tendencies not reach the stage at which further
advance is brought to a halt? This is quite possible. But just as we have
argued that it would be a mistake to try from the very start to avoid a
narrow theater of operations and therefore rob the attack of its momentum,
we continue to argue that so long as the general has not yet defeated the
enemy, so long as he believes himself to be strong enough to gain his
objectives, he must persevere. He may do so with increasing danger, but his
success will be all the greater. Should he reach a point beyond which he
dare not go, should he feel he must expand to right and left in order to
protect his rear, so be it: very likely his attack has reached its culminating
point. Its momentum is exhausted; and if the enemy is still unbroken, there
is probably no future in it anyway.

passes and provinces, still means slow progress, but the progress is relative,
no longer absolute. The enemy’s precipitate retreat has stopped; he may be
getting ready to renew his resistance, and it is now possible that even
though the attacker is still improving his position the defender, by doing the
same, is improving his chances every day. We repeat, in short, that once a
pause has become necessary there can as a rule be no recurrence of the
advance.

the attack must not be interrupted. If the general relinquishes this aim
because he considers the attendant risk too great, he will be right to break
off and extend his front. Theory would blame him only if he does so in
order to facilitate the defeat of the enemy.

We are not so foolish as to suggest that history contains no example of a

state being brought to the last extremity by degrees. Our suggested thesis is
not an absolute truth admitting no exception, but is simply based on the
normal and likely course of events. Further, we must establish whether the
decline of a state was the gradual result of a historical process or was the
outcome of a single campaign. We are here only dealing with the latter case,
for only here are forces in such tension that they either overcome the load
upon them or are in danger of succumbing to it. If the first year’s fighting
yields a slight advantage and the second year’s increases it so that little by
little one approaches the objective, the danger is nowhere very grave, but
just for that reason it is all the more widespread. Every pause between one
success and the next gives the enemy new opportunities. One success has
little influence on the next, and often none at all. The influence may well be
adverse, for the enemy either recovers and rouses himself to greater
resistance or obtains help from somewhere else. But when a single impetus
obtains from start to finish, yesterday’s victory makes certain of today’s,
and one fire starts another. For every case of a state reduced to ruin by
successive blows—which means that time, the defender’s patron, has
deserted to the other side—how many more are there in which time ruined
the plans of the attacker! It is enough to cite the outcome of the Seven Years
War, in which the Austrians sought their goal with such leisure, prudence
and caution that they missed it completely.

soundly administered theater of operations should go hand in hand with the
offensive thrust and in a sense balance it. On the contrary, we regard the
disadvantages that attach to the offensive as unavoidable evils that should
not merit our attention until the advance promises no further hope.129

The case of Bonaparte in 1812, far from undermining our argument,

merely confirms it.

is usually believed, but because the only way to achieve success failed.
Russia is not a country that can be formally conquered—that is to say
occupied—certainly not with the present strength of the European States
and not even with the half-a-million men Bonaparte mobilized for the
purpose. Only internal weakness, only the workings of disunity can bring a
country of that kind to ruin. To strike at these weaknesses in its political life
it is necessary to thrust into the heart of the state. Only if he could reach
Moscow in strength could Bonaparte hope to shake the government’s nerve
and the people’s loyalty and steadfastness. In Moscow he hoped to find
peace; that was the only rational war aim he could set himself.

back before him, past the Drissa camp, and never stopped till they got to
Smolensk. He forced Bagration to withdraw as well, defeated both the
Russian armies and occupied Moscow. He acted as he had always done.
This is how he had come to dominate Europe, and this was the only way in
which he could have done so. No one who admired Bonaparte as the
greatest of commanders in his previous campaigns should feel superior to
him with regard to this one.

criterion. But a judgment based on the result alone must not be passed off as
evidence of human wisdom. To discover why a campaign failed is not the
same thing as to criticize it; but if we go on and show that the causes could
and should have been seen and acted on, we assume the role of critic, and
set ourselves up above the general.

Anyone who asserts that the campaign of 1812 was an absurdity because

of its enormous failure but who would have called it a superb idea if it had
worked, shows complete lack of judgment.

think he should have done, so as to make certain of its fortresses (of which,
incidentally, Riga, lying to one side, is really the only one; Bobruisk is a
wretched little place) it would have involved him in miserable defensive
operations for the winter. The critics would then have been the first to
exclaim, “That is no longer the old Bonaparte! He has not even forced his
first great battle—the man who used to seal his conquests of enemy states
by victories on their last ramparts, as at Austerlitz and Friedland. Moscow,

the enemy’s capital, is defenseless—ripe for surrender. Why has he failed to
capture it and thus left it as a rallying point for fresh resistance? He had the
incredible luck to surprise this remote giant as easily as a nearby city or as
Frederick overwhelmed the small and neighboring Silesia—and he does not
exploit his advantage. He breaks off his triumphant progress as if the devil
was at his heels!” That is the sort of talk we should have heard, for that is
the way most critics form their judgments.

We maintain that the 1812 campaign failed because the Russian

government kept its nerve and the people remained loyal and steadfast. The
campaign could not succeed. Bonaparte may have been wrong to engage in
it at all; at least the outcome certainly shows that he miscalculated; but we
argue that if he was to aim at that objective, there was, broadly speaking, no
other way of gaining it.

war in the East on top of the one he was already fighting in the West,
Bonaparte tried the only means he had—a bold attack, which would compel
his demoralized opponent to make peace. The risk of losing his army in the
process had to be accepted; that was the stake in the game, the price of his
vast hopes. It may have been his fault if his army was punished more
severely than it need have been, but the fault did not lie in the depth to
which he penetrated Russia; that was his object and was unavoidable. It lay
in his being late in starting the campaign, in the lives he squandered by his
tactics, his neglect of matters of supply and of his line of retreat. Lastly, he
stayed too long in Moscow.

to bar the way at the Beresina in the hope of cutting off his retreat. The
battle showed precisely how difficult it is to achieve such an object. The
conditions were the worst conceivable, but the French contrived to fight
their way through all the same. This whole episode deepened the
catastrophe, but did not cause it. Second, it was only the unusual nature of
the country that enabled the Russians to achieve as much as they did, for if
the main road had not crossed the marshes of the Beresina with their
wooded, inaccessible approaches, it would have been still less feasible to
cut off the French army. Third, the only possible way of guarding against
that risk would be by advancing on a certain breadth of front. To that we
have already objected that once we are committed to an advance in the

center while leaving armies behind as flank guards to left and right, any
mishap to one of these would make us withdraw our center. Nothing much
could then be expected of the offensive.

confronted Wittgenstein. At Riga there was an adequate investing-force—
which, incidentally, was superfluous; and Schwarzenberg in the south had
50,000 men, outnumbering Tormasov’s and almost equaling even
Chichagov’s force. In addition, there was Victor with 30,000 men as a
central reserve. Even at the most critical period, in November, when
Russian strength had grown while the French were already very much
depleted, the Russians were not yet markedly superior in the rear of the
Moscow army.
Wittgenstein, Chichagov, and Sacken had 110,000 men between them.
Schwarzenberg, Reynier, Victor, Oudinot, and St. Cyr together still had
80,000 men. The most cautious general on the move would hardly have
given his flanks more protection than that. Of the 600,000 men who crossed
the Niemen in 1812 Bonaparte might have brought a quarter-million back
instead of the 50,000 who recrossed it under Schwarzenberg, Reynier, and
Macdonald, if he had not committed the mistakes we blame him for; but the
campaign would have been a failure just the same. There would, however,
have been nothing to criticize in theory, for the loss of more than half an
army in such a case is not unusual. If it strikes us as such, the reason is
simply the scale of the expedition.

inseparable from it. As for secondary operations, we would emphasize that
all have a common aim, but this aim must be such as not to paralyze the
activities of the separate parts. If anyone invaded France from the upper and
the middle Rhine and from Holland, intending to join up in Paris, and if
each army were ordered to take no risk and preserve itself so far as possible
intact until it reached its rendezvous, we would call such a plan calamitous.
A sort of balance between the three of them would be sure to come about
and cause delay, timidity, and hesitation in each. It would be better to leave
each army its own mission and only insist on united action at the point
where their various activities naturally coincide.

The separation of forces in order to reunite again a few days later is a

detached it should know why, and the purpose must be met. This purpose
cannot simply consist in a subsequent reunion as if one was dancing a
quadrille.

given a distinct objective. What matters is that the armies everywhere
expend their full energies, not that all of them should make proportionate
gains.

scheme is not what it expected, or if it runs into bad luck, the actions of the
others must not be modified or a general success will be unlikely from the
start. Only if most of them are unfortunate or if the principal operations fail
is it right and necessary that the others should be affected. Then it is the
plan itself that has gone wrong.

given a defensive role but set free by their success to take the offensive—
unless one prefers to transfer their superfluous units to the main point of the
offensive. The question will principally turn on the topography of the
theater of operations.

But then what becomes of the geometric form and unity of the whole

attack? What happens to the flanks and rear of columns adjoining
operational units? It is exactly this kind of attitude which we are especially
concerned to combat. The glueing together of a major offensive into a
geometrical square is to get lost in a false intellectual system.

In the fifteenth chapter of Book Three we showed that the geometric

element is less effective in strategy than in tactics, and at this point we need
only restate the conclusion—that actual successes at particular points,
especially in the offensive, deserve much more attention than the shape that
may gradually emerge from the varying fortunes of the attack at one point
or another.

In any case, seeing the large areas with which strategy is concerned, the

commander-in-chief can properly be left to deal with the arguments and
decisions that settle the geometric pattern of the parts, and so no
subordinate commander has the right to ask what his neighbor is doing or
failing to do. He can be told simply to carry out his orders. If serious
dislocation should really result, the supreme command can still put it right.
In this way the objection to separate operations is removed—that is, the

obfuscation of realities by a cloud of fears and suppositions that seeps into
the actual course of events, so that every mishap affects not just the part that
suffers it but, contagiously, all the rest, and personal weakness and
antipathies among subordinate commanders are given ample scope.

who have spent much time and thought on the study of military history,
learned to distinguish between essentials and inessentials, and fully realize
the influence of human weaknesses.

As all experienced soldiers will admit, it is difficult even from the tactical

point of view to make a success of an attack in several separate columns by
smoothly coordinating every part. How much more difficult, or rather, how
impossible the same must be in strategy, where intervals are so much
greater! If then the smooth coordination of all parts is a precondition of
success, a strategic attack of that kind ought to be avoided altogether. But,
on the one hand, one is never wholly free to reject it since it may be
imposed by circumstances that one cannot alter; while, on the other, the
smooth coordination of every part of the action from start to finish is not
even necessary in tactics, let alone strategy. From the strategic point of
view, then, there is all the more reason to ignore it; and it is all the more
important to insist that every part be given an independent task.

We must add an important comment concerning the proper division of

labor.

In 1793 and 1794 the main Austrian army was in the Netherlands, with

the Prussian army on the upper Rhine. Austrian troops then marched from
Vienna to Condé and Valenciennes, crossing the Prussians’ route to Landau
from Berlin. Admittedly, the Austrians had their Belgian provinces to
defend, and they would have welcomed any conquests made in French
Flanders. But that concern was not adequate reason for these arrangements,
and after Prince Kaunitz’s death the Austrian Minister Thugut determined
to relinquish the Netherlands altogether for the sake of a better
concentration of his forces. Austria is indeed almost twice as far from
Flanders as from Alsace, and at a time when troops were strictly limited and
their supplies had to be paid for in cash, that was no small consideration.
But Thugut had yet another point in mind. He wanted to confront Holland,
England, and Prussia, the powers that had the most interest in the defense of
the Netherlands and the lower Rhine, with the urgency of the danger and the

need for making greater efforts. He miscalculated, because at that time there
was no way to make the Prussian government change its policy; but these
events show the influence that political considerations had on the course of
the war.

Prussia had nothing to defend or to conquer in Alsace. Her march in 1792

through Lorraine to Champagne had been made in a spirit of chivalry, but
since as things turned out that operation promised little more, she pursued
the war without enthusiasm. Had the Prussian troops been in the
Netherlands, they would have been next door to Holland, which they almost
looked on as their own, having occupied it in 1787; they would then have
covered the lower Rhine and with it the part of Prussia that was nearest the
theater of operations. Through her subsidies Prussia also had a closer
alliance with England, and would thus less easily have become involved in
the machinations of which at that time she became guilty.

placed their main force on the upper Rhine and the Prussians theirs into the
Netherlands, where Austria would only have left a modest corps.

the enterprising Marshal Blücher and Blücher had stayed with the main
army under Schwarzenberg, the campaign might well have broken down
completely. Again, if the enterprising Laudon had not been given Silesia,
the strongest part of Prussia, as a theater of operations, but had been with
the army of the Holy Roman Empire, the whole of the Seven Years War
might well have turned out differently.

For a closer look at the subject, let us examine the main characteristics of

the following cases.

not only our allies but have independent interests of their own.

The second is when an allied army comes to our assistance.
The third is when all that matters is the personalities of the commanders.
In the first two cases, the question is whether the various allied troops are

better mixed, so that armies have corps of different nationalities as was
done in 1813-1814, or better kept as separate as possible so that each can
play an independent role. Clearly the first is the better plan; but it assumes a
rare degree of friendliness and common interest. With forces integrated in
that way their governments will find it much more difficult to pursue their

private interests; and as for their commanders’ egoism, its harmful
influence can, in the circumstances, only show among the subordinate
commanders—that is, in the tactical realm, and even then less freely and
with less impunity than if national contingents were completely separate. In
the latter case it will extend to strategy, and crucial matters will be affected.
But as we have said, a rare degree of self-effacement is required of
governments. Sheer necessity drove everyone in that direction in 1813. Still
one cannot speak too highly of the Czar of Russia. Although he commanded
the largest army in the field and had had the greatest share in the reversal of
our fortunes, he placed his forces under Prussian and Austrian generals and
made no pretension to command an independent Russian force.

them completely rather than partially separate. The worst situation of all
invariably results when two autonomous generals of different nationality
share a theater, as was often the case with Russian, Austrian, and Imperial
forces in the Seven Years War. If forces are wholly separate it is easier to
divide the burdens; each army will then suffer only from its own.
Circumstances will, therefore, stimulate each to greater efforts. But if they
are in close contact with each other, or even in the same operational theater,
that will not occur, and, what is more, if one of them does show bad faith
the others will be paralyzed.

sketched, for each state’s natural interests will normally settle how its forces
should be used. That may not be so in the second case, and in that event
there is usually no choice but to place one’s troops entirely at the disposal
of the allied army, assuming the latter’s size to be at all appropriate. The
Austrians did this at the end of the campaign of 1815 as the Prussians had in
1807.

individual, but one general comment must be made. Though it is often
done, subordinate armies should not be put under the command of the
soundest and most cautious men. The right men here are the most
enterprising ones, for we must again insist that in separate strategic
operations nothing is more important than that every part should do its best
and develop its powers to the full. Any error made at one point can be set
off against successes elsewhere. But maximum effort by everyone can only

be ensured if all commanders are spirited, active, eager men, with a strong
inner drive. Cool objective deliberation about the need for action is seldom
enough.

Lastly, it remains to be said that wherever possible troops and

commanders should be assigned to missions and areas appropriate to their
special qualities. Regular armies, excellent troops, abundant cavalry,
elderly, wise, and prudent generals should be used in open country; militia,
national levies, hurriedly mobilized rabble, young and enterprising generals
in wooded country, mountainous areas, and passes; and auxiliary forces in
prosperous areas where they will enjoy themselves.

this chapter in particular, about plans intended to achieve the total defeat of
the enemy, has been intended to emphasize their object and then to suggest
principles to guide operational arrangements. We wished to gain a clear
understanding of what we want and should do in such a war. We would

reached the conclusion that they are apt to be a great deal less important
than is usually thought. The part that they can or ought to play in a war
intended to defeat the enemy is even slighter. It certainly cannot affect the
general plan.

end of the present book.130 To conclude the present chapter we shall offer
an example.

If Austria, Prussia, the German Confederation, the Netherlands, and

England decide to make war on France, with Russia neutral—a case the last
century-and-a-half has often seen—they would have capacity enough to

wage an offensive war with the object of totally defeating the enemy. Large
and powerful as France is, the greater part of her territory might well be
overrun by hostile armies; Paris would be in enemy hands and France
herself reduced to inadequate resources, with no other state but Russia able
to give her really effective help. Spain is too far away and badly placed; the
Italian states are still too weak and unstable. Not counting their possessions
overseas the countries named have 75 million inhabitants to draw on while
France has only 30 millions. At a conservative estimate the army that could
take the field for a really serious attack on France could be composed as
follows:

be far superior to any that France could field against it. Under Bonaparte
she never raised a force of comparable strength. Allowing for the troops
required to man the fortresses and depots and to guard the coast, there can
be little doubt that the allies would have a significant superiority in the
principal theater; and this superiority would be the main consideration in
their plan to bring about a French collapse.

The center of gravity of France lies in the armed forces and in Paris. The

allied aim must, therefore, be to defeat the army in one or more major
battles, capture Paris, and drive the remnants of the enemy’s troops across
the Loire. The most vulnerable area of France is that between Paris and
Brussels, where the frontier is only 150 miles from the capital. That is the
natural concentration area for one group of allies—England, the
Netherlands, Prussia, and the North German states—all of which have
territories nearby, some being actually adjacent. Austria and southern
Germany can conveniently operate only from the upper Rhine, and their
natural direction of attack is toward Troyes and Paris, possibly also toward
Orleans. Both invasion lines, the one from the Netherlands and the other

from the upper Rhine, are perfectly natural, short, unforced, and effective;
and the center of gravity of France’s power is where the two lines meet.
Between these two points, therefore, the whole offensive force should be
divided.

Only two considerations qualify the simplicity of this plan.
The Austrians will not uncover their Italian provinces. They will always

wish to control the situation there, and hence they will never let matters
reach a point where Italy is only indirectly covered by forces engaged in
attacking the heart of France. The state of Italian politics being what it is,
this Austrian concern, though secondary, is real; but it would be a great
mistake to let the old and oft-attempted scheme of attacking southern
France from Italy be linked with it. Austrian strength in Italy would then be
raised to a far higher level than security alone would require if the first
campaign met with grave reverses. Only modest numbers should remain in
Italy, and nothing more should be withheld from the main offensive if the
precept of all precepts is to be observed—unity

conception,

concentration of strength. One could as easily pick up a musket by the tip
of the bayonet as conquer France by way of the Rhône. But even as a
supplementary operation an attack on southern France should be
condemned, for it could only stimulate fresh sources of resistance.
Whenever an outlying province is attacked, one stirs up concerns and
activities that would otherwise have remained quiescent. An attack on
southern France from Italy would not be justified unless it were obvious
that the forces left in Italy were more than its security required and were,
therefore, destined to be idle.

smallest that conditions permit. It is large enough if it will save the
Austrians from losing the whole area in one campaign. For the purpose of
our illustration we shall put it at 50,000 men.

sea; France must, therefore, be extremely sensitive about her whole Atlantic
coast and she must keep some forces to defend it. However weak their
coastal defenses might be, they make her frontiers three times as long and
hence she must withdraw substantial forces from the theater of war. If
England has 20,000 to 30,000 landing troops available to threaten France,
they might perhaps immobilize two or three times as many French; and this

would involve not only troops but also money, guns, etc., for the fleet and
the coastal batteries. Let us assume that for this purpose the English have
25,000 men.

follows:

Netherlanders, 25,000 English, 50,000 North-German Federal Troops—
350,000 men.

which would leave 300,000 free to advance on Paris and fight a major battle
against the French.

Second, 200,000 Austrians and 100,000 South-German troops would be

assembled on the Rhineland. They and the Dutch would advance
simultaneously toward the upper Seine and thence toward the Loire, and
would also aim at a major battle. The two thrusts might perhaps be united
on the Loire.

remove misunderstandings, and are as follows:

1. The main concern of the commanders-in-chief must be to seek the

necessary major battle and fight it with such superiority of numbers, and
under such conditions, as will promise decisive victory. Everything must be
sacrificed to that objective and the fewest possible men should be diverted
into sieges, investments, garrisons, and the like. If, like Schwarzenberg in
1814, they fan out as soon as they reach enemy soil, all will be lost. In 1814
it was only the impotence of France that saved the allies from complete
disaster in the first two weeks. The attack should be like a well-hammered
wedge, not a bubble that expands till it bursts.

2. Switzerland must be left to its own devices. If neutral, it forms a good

point d’appui on the upper Rhine. If France attacks it, let it defend itself—
which it can do very well in more respects than one. Nothing could be more
foolish than to. think that Switzerland, as the highest ground in Europe,
must dominate the geographical course of the war. That influence could
only operate under certain very limited conditions, which do not exist in the
present case.

least of all can the altitude of Switzerland count as a decisive factor. Any
advantage from this kind of strategic domination accrues in the first place
primarily to the defense, and any importance it has for the attack can only
operate in the first assault. If anyone does not understand this, he has not
yet thought it through. If in a future council of war some learned general
staff officer should solemnly serve up this kind of wisdom, we declare it in
advance to be arrant nonsense, and we hope that some tough fighting
soldier, full of commonsense, will be there to shut him up.

600,000 men assembled only 150 or 200 miles from Paris, poised to strike
at the very heart of France, need one really think about covering the upper
Rhine—which means covering Berlin, Dresden, Munich, and Vienna?
There would be no point in doing so. Should the lateral communications be
covered? This merits some attention; but one might then logically be led to
give this cover the strength and significance of another offensive. Then
instead of advancing on two lines, which the location of the allied states
makes unavoidable, one would find them advancing along three, which is
not necessary. The three could then turn into five, or even seven, and the
whole sad business would begin again.

that the forces detailed for them will be markedly superior to the enemy’s.
If each attack is pressed with determination it cannot fail to benefit the
other. Should one of them run into trouble because the enemy’s strength has
not been equally divided, it should be possible to rely on success by the
other automatically to repair the damage. This is the real connection
between the two armies. Seeing how far apart they are, an interdependence
covering day-to-day events would not be possible. Nor is it needed; so close
or, rather, direct links between the two have little value.

worth speaking of to disrupt the cooperation of the two offensives. The
worst that can happen is that the populace, supported by raiding parties,
might try to do this, and save the French from diverting regular forces for
this purpose. To counter them only a corps of 10,000 to 15,000 men, strong
in cavalry, need be sent out from Treves in the general direction of Rheims.
It will ride roughshod over any raiding party and can keep up with the main
force. It should neither watch fortresses nor invest them, but by-pass them;

it should not depend on any definite base, and should retire before superior
force in any direction it pleases. No great harm can befall it, and even if it
did, that would be no disaster for the whole. Under these conditions such a
corps might usefully serve as a link between the two offensives.

English landing force—can pursue their purposes at their discretion.
Provided they are not idle, their existence will be justified, and under no
condition should either of the main offensives be in any way dependent on
them.

knees and taught a lesson any time she chooses to resume that insolent
behavior with which she has burdened Europe for a hundred and fifty years.
Only on the far side of Paris, only on the Loire, can she be made to accept
the conditions which the peace of Europe calls for. Nothing else will
demonstrate the natural relationship between thirty millions and seventy-
five. But that will certainly not be done if France is ringed by armies from
Dunkirk to Genoa, as she has been for a century and a half, while fifty
different small objectives are pursued, not one of them important enough to
overcome the inertia, the friction, and the outside interests that always
emerge, especially in allied armies, and perpetually reappear.

provisional organization of the federal German armies. By this the federal
part of Germany is to form the nucleus of German power; Prussia and
Austria are thus weakened and lose the preponderance they should possess.
But a federal state is a poor sort of nucleus in war time, lacking unity and
vigor, without any rational way of choosing its commander, bereft of
authority or responsibility.

Two natural centers of power exist in the German Reich—Austria and

Prussia. Theirs is the genuine striking-power, theirs is the strong blade.
Each is a monarchy, experienced in war. Their interests are clearly defined;
they are independent powers and are preeminent above all the rest. These
natural lines, not the mistaken idea of “unity,” define the lines that German
military organization should follow. Unity is anyhow impossible under
these conditions, and the man who sacrifices the possible in search of the
impossible is a fool.

A COMMENTARY

A Guide to the Reading of On War

  
I observed in my introductory essay that many find Clausewitz difficult to
read with comprehension, even though the ideas presented are not
intrinsically difficult. The reasons are several, the most important being that
whether because of the richness of example and qualification or the
sometimes faulty organization, the main thread of the argument is often lost
in the development. Also, Clausewitz is occasionally, though not often,
metaphysical, and this worries readers more than it needs to. In addition,
some long sections are of purely historical value, or, as some would hold,
obsolete, while others are charged with the greatest significance for
contemporary times, and it may help the reader to be alerted in advance to
which is which. Finally, a reader not familiar with the field will have no
means of knowing how distinctive are some of the points that the author
makes, and he may profit from having this quality pointed out at the
appropriate places. I have no desire to gild the lily, and if I am sometimes
guilty of superfluous applause, I shall make amends by warning of sections
which are relatively unrewarding.

In short, the main purpose of this guide is to enhance the reader’s

comprehension of the text at first reading. If he finds it failing in that
purpose, or not sufficiently succeeding in it to be worth his time, he should
avail himself of the nearest exit, which is as close as the next comma or
period.

The reader will find the way that suits him best for using this guide.

Some few may want to read it through before going to the text. Perhaps
most will want to use it book by book, or even in smaller doses, in
association with the text. It may help also as a quick review after reading

the text, as well as for finding remembered passages of which one cannot
recall the exact location.

some chapters or passages and to touch others quite lightly or skip them
entirely, in the latter instance without necessarily mentioning that we are
doing so. It is not only that some portions are indeed more significant or
arresting than others but also that some excellent chapters offer no special
pitfalls.

note which the author left behind with his manuscript tells of his unfulfilled
plans for its revision. In the interval between writing these two papers he
had entirely rewritten the first chapter of Book One, which is the only one
he regarded as finished. His plans for further revision would seek mainly to
make two ideas stand out in bolder relief throughout the work. These are (1)
the importance of always distinguishing between the respective
requirements of general and of limited war (applying modern terminology),
and (2) the essential and all-pervading necessity of recognizing that “war is
simply the continuation of policy by other means” (Clausewitz’s italics).
One senses that the latter idea, though approached early in the author’s
career, was still not crystalized in his mind, because it is developed only
among the last portions that he worked on, that is, Chapter Six of Book
Eight and the finally revised first chapter of Book One, and also because he
talks of expecting the further working out of Book Eight to help clear his
own mind on the subject. Possibly Book Eight as we now see it received
some of that further working out after the 1827 “Notice” was written, but it
was not yet in final form when the author left for Silesia in 1830, where he
was to die a year later, and certainly he had not got round to suffusing the
idea through the whole work.

BOOK ONE: ON THE NATURE OF WAR

 
We pass, without comment on the “Author’s Preface,” to Book One,
Chapter One, the only chapter completed to the author’s satisfaction. It is
one of the most densely packed with ideas in the whole work, and their
sweep and importance make this chapter a most comprehensive
introduction. It may also be for some readers somewhat confusing without
the appropriate key, which I shall here attempt to provide—in more detail
than will apply to other chapters.

The object of war, Clausewitz says in a three-tiered statement, is (a) to

impose our will on the enemy, to do which (b) we use the means of
maximum available force, with (c) the aim of rendering him powerless. We
thus note at the outset the distinction between military aim and political
object.

Distress at the brutality of war must not be allowed to inhibit the use of

means for “war is such a dangerous business that the mistakes that come
from kindness are the very worst.” Civilized nations may practice
inhibitions, but this is due to social forces which “are not part of war.” And
then: “To introduce the principle of moderation into the theory of war itself
would always lead to logical absurdity” (italics added).

The meaning will be a little clearer if one observes that in these opening

pages Clausewitz is using word-images made fashionable by the great
German philosophers of his day, especially Kant and Hegel. They had
powerfully revived the ancient metaphysical school which bears the
somewhat deceptive name of “idealism.” Thus, in the language of this
school, war is simply another form of being that, like any other form of
being, derives from an essential pattern or “idea” in which it has its true
reality. To understand war properly, one must first see it in its “absolute” or
“ideal” form, which Clausewitz calls the “pure concept of war.” It is in this
sense that he speaks of “the theory of war [in] itself,” which recalls Kant’s
famous phrase, das Ding an sich (“the thing in itself”). Fortunately,
Clausewitz was of much too pragmatic a fiber to lose himself either deeply

or for long in this brand of idealism, but here as the curtain rises on his
masterwork, this man who never graduated from a university enters wearing
the gown of academe.

word. Certainly he believes profoundly in what he is saying. He has
witnessed some of the worst horrors in the long grim history of war,
including the disastrous crossing of the Berezina River by the French in
their retreat from Moscow, which he saw with his own eyes from the
Russian side and which he described with the most deep-felt, shuddering
anguish in a letter to his wife. Yet he was later also to write, in criticism of
the Russian general nearest the scene, Wittgenstein, that if he had attacked
more forthrightly “he might have made the French loss much greater.” A
sensitive man unquestionably, Clausewitz had long since come to terms, at
least intellectually, with the harsh demands of his profession. He was quite
conscious that he had to steel himself emotionally to meet these demands,
not once and for all but repeatedly, and he loses no time in imposing upon
the reader a comparable obligation. It is noteworthy that he feels the need to
mention these unpleasant and disturbing things, which other writers on
strategy have not.

war by passion, which inevitably distorts the clear conception of the object.
“If war is an act of force, the emotions cannot fail to be involved.” Since the
thrust of the main argument of the work will be in the opposite direction, it
is necessary to get these matters straight at the outset.

Having made his bow to the “extremes” of war, in which he has not

failed to set down some important practical ideas, he makes an epochal shift
to the ground he will occupy for virtually all the rest of the work. He gives
to Section Six the title “Modifications in Practice.” When we move from
the abstract to the real world, “the whole thing looks quite different.” War in
its abstract or “perfect” form could exist in the real world only if certain
conditions were met, the most important being that war should be “a wholly
isolated act, occurring suddenly and not produced by previous events in the
political world.” But, he says, “war is never an isolated act.” He notices also
that “even the ultimate outcome of a war is not to be regarded always as the
final one” (his own Prussia had been virtually annihilated as a military
power in the Jena campaign of 1806, only to come back strong in the

campaigns of 1813 and 1814 and at Waterloo in 1815, and Clausewitz had
been deeply involved in all these events).

motive for the war, now perhaps modified by operating in a war context. In
some cases the political and the military objectives are the same, as in the
conquest of a province intended to be kept; in other cases “another military
aim will be adopted that will serve the political purpose and symbolize it in
the peace negotiations.” Here Clausewitz has in mind, for example, seizing
and holding a territory only for bargaining purposes. But in these decisions
one must tread carefully; “attention must be paid to the character of each
state involved.” What will induce one nation to yield will cause another to
resist more fiercely.

activity in war, where he develops a concept which he calls the “principle of
polarity” but which turns out to be exactly the idea for which we should
now use the term “zero-sum game” (that is, a contest in which the gain of
one is directly proportional to the loss of the other). Many war situations, he
points out, do not fall into this pattern; the loss of one is not always the gain
of the other. He introduces the idea, to be developed later, that “defense is a
stronger form of fighting than attack.” Clausewitz still makes occasional
references to “the Absolute,” that is, to the perfect or pure form of war, but
increasingly he emphasizes and dwells upon those qualities which remove
war from that realm.

He now moves toward a more precise definition of war. “Were it a

complete, untrammeled, absolute manifestation of violence (as the pure
concept would require), war would of its own independent will usurp the
place of policy the moment policy had brought it into being.” Actually, that
is exactly what many if not most modern generals have felt should happen.
There is more than a smell of that idea in General MacArthur’s phrase:
“There is no substitute for victory.” And this is also the view that
Clausewitz commonly experienced in his own time, but he quite
unflinchingly calls it “thoroughly mistaken.” He now leads up to his great
and famous formula in the following words: “If we keep in mind that war
springs from some political purpose, it is natural that the prime cause of its
existence will remain the supreme consideration in conducting it.... It must
adapt itself to its chosen means, a process which can radically change it; yet

the political aim remains the first consideration. Policy, then, will permeate
all military operations and, in so far as their violent nature will admit, it will
have a continuous influence on them.” This naturally brings him to the
pronouncement which is the title of the next section: “War Is Merely the
Continuation of Policy by Other Means.”

us exactly what he means by it. It is a specific meaning not likely to be
sensed correctly by the person who has simply heard the phrase quoted to
him. The conception is age-old and yet forever neglected or rejected. It
suffers this fate for a number of reasons, one being that war does arouse
passions, usually very strong ones, and another being that generals like to
win decisively whatever contests they are engaged in, and do not like to be
trammeled by a political authority imposing considerations that might
modify that aim.

Clausewitz concedes that the general has a right to demand that the

trends of policy shall not be inconsistent with the means he is being called
upon to use. That is no small demand, he adds, but it will never do more
than modify the political aims. Then he says again: “The political object is
the goal, war is the means of reaching it, and means can never be
considered in isolation from their purposes.”

The strain between political purpose and military aim, Clausewitz then

points out, is minimal in what we would now call general war. “The more
powerful and inspiring the motives for war ... the closer war will approach
its abstract concept ... the more closely will the military aims and the
political objects of war coincide, and the more military and less political
will war appear to be.” On the other hand, where motives are less intense,
as in limited war, “the political object will be more and more at variance
with the aim of ideal war, and the conflict will seem increasingly political
in character.” However: “While policy is apparently effaced in the one kind
of war and yet is strongly evident in the other, both kinds are equally
political.” The reason is that “among the contingencies for which the state
must be prepared is a war in which every element calls for policy to be
eclipsed by violence.” He is describing total war, which today would be
nuclear, but the acceptance of such a state of affairs is still policy.

but also on obliging us to keep it everlastingly in our minds. He insists and

reiterates that war is always an instrument of policy because he knew, and
we know today, that the usual practice is rather to let war take over national
policy.
  

wars are and ought to be kept limited, in duration and object as well as in
intensity and means. In reading it (and later chapters) one remembers wryly
that Clausewitz has been often called the “apostle of total war.” This
opinion is likely to be confined to those who have never touched the book.
However, even the late Colonel Joseph I. Greene, in writing a foreword to a
previous translation of On War, attributes to Clausewitz the central thesis
that the aim of war is the overthrow of the enemy’s powers of resistance,
and then adds: “He had witnessed the whole course of Napoleon’s
campaigns, and had seen that Napoleon fought his wars to win them. There
might have been men or nations who went into wars with some lesser
intention in mind. But war as a whole could not be seriously discussed on
any such half-way basis.”131 Either Colonel Greene had never got to the
second chapter of the book for which he was writing a foreword (actually
Clausewitz had already signaled his views on the subject in the first
chapter), or, more likely, a casual reading (though he warned against such
casualness) did not touch his prepossessions.

After opening the chapter with a brief discussion of wars that are not

limited in aim, in which the author reminds us again that even the
successful accomplishment of such aims is not necessarily final
(Napoleon’s victories are relevant here, as are Hitler’s), he goes on to
consider examples where one or both sides aim at something less than the
complete disarming of the enemy.

Though this kind of conflict does not conform to the pure theory of war,

so much the worse for pure theory. “On no account,” he says, “should
theory raise [the aim to disarm the enemy] to the level of law.”

Anyway, the aim of totally disarming the enemy is obviously unrealistic

in all those cases where he is substantially stronger. Even where it is
possible to carry on the struggle, grounds for making peace exist where,
first, victory is improbable, and second, where it is unacceptably costly.
Whether it is either depends not only on strength but on motivation: “Since

war is not an act of senseless passion but is controlled by its political
purpose, the value of this purpose must determine the sacrifices to be made
for it in magnitude and also in duration. Once the expenditure of effort
exceeds the value of the political purpose, the purpose must be renounced
and peace must follow.”

alter in the course of the war, and may finally change entirely, since they are
influenced by events and their probable consequences.” He seems, however,
to be clearly rejecting any sense of inevitability about such basic changes,
especially as they might arise out of the war itself. For to admit even a high
probability of such a feedback effect would be to destroy his basic
contention that war is the instrument of policy and not the reverse. Clearly
he is implying the necessity of control, both on passions and on notions of
prestige.

all involve the opponent’s outright defeat.” He reviews what these many
roads are, including attrition and “merely passive waiting for enemy
attacks,” which may wear down the will of an enemy who has no great will
to begin with, and he notices that it is important always to bear in mind the
ad hominem circumstances. “The personalities of statesmen and soldiers are
such important factors that in war above all it is vital not to underrate
them.”

Although the political object of war may vary infinitely, from the will to

annihilation to the reluctant fulfillment of an alliance obligation, the means
of war is always the same—combat. However the forms of combat are also
widely variable, from that which seeks destruction of the enemy forces to
mere passive resistance. But the commander who prefers any strategy other
than destruction of the enemy’s armed forces “must first be sure that his
opponent either will not appeal to that supreme tribunal ... or that he will
lose the verdict if he does.”
  

Book One, Chapter Three: Inasmuch as the author will subsequently be

attaching great importance to the talent or genius of the commander, he
devotes this early chapter to analyzing the character of military genius. It is
quite distinctive from what we call genius in other callings. For one thing,
sheer physical courage is “the soldier’s first requirement.” No doubt it

mattered more in his own day than it does in ours—one thinks of
Wellington constantly in danger at Waterloo, or old Blücher injured two
days earlier at Ligny when his horse was killed under him—but even in our
own time the top commander rises to his post by showing his mettle in
combat. Similarly, the commander must make himself indifferent to the
physical exertion and suffering of others.

Clausewitz considers the matter with great care, and he concludes that
inasmuch as quick intuitive judgment and determination are much more
necessary than great powers of meditation, what is required is “a strong
mind rather than a brilliant one.” The response to the unexpected need not
be exceptional, “so long as it meets the situation.” But qualities of
temperament, such as those which make for strength of will and energy in
action, are equally integral to the commander’s genius.

the passions that inspire man in battle”—which give him above all the
requisite energy in action—“none ... is so powerful and so constant as the
longing for honor and renown.” Other emotions, he says, may be more
common and more venerated, “but they are no substitute for a thirst for
fame and honor.” In this respect introspection might have got the better of
his objective judgment, for there is no doubt that Clausewitz is describing a
thirst which affected him deeply. Still, we should also observe that in
dealing with this provocative and elusive subject, he never let himself slip
into romanticism, as so many others have done.

stressing the importance of what he calls a sense of terrain and of locality,
he says: “We attribute this ability to the imagination; but this is about the
only service that war can demand from this frivolous goddess, who in most
military affairs is liable to do more harm than good.” He leaves the
comprehension of this somewhat cryptic statement to the reader’s
imagination, but in summing up the qualities of true genius in the supreme
commander (just after mentioning the name of Bonaparte), he says: “What
this task requires in the way of higher intellectual gifts is a sense of unity
and a power of judgment, raised to a marvelous pitch of vision, which
easily grasps and dismisses a thousand remote possibilities an ordinary
mind would labor to identify, and wear itself out in doing so. Yet even that

superb display of divination, the sovereign eye of genius itself, would still
fall short of historic significance without the qualities of character and
temperament we have described.” Nor has he failed to call attention to the
importance of the commander’s having a thorough grasp of national policy.
“On that level strategy and policy coalesce: the commander-in-chief is
simultaneously a statesman.” And then, at the end, he identifies military
genius with “the inquiring rather than the creative mind, the comprehensive
rather than the specialized approach, the calm rather than the excitable
head.”
  

form a unit in that their central concern is with that characteristic of war
which Clausewitz calls “friction” and which he mainly elucidates in
Chapter Seven. Friction is what so frequently makes difficult and hence
precarious of execution what looks so simple and easy on paper; it is what
makes so much depend on the will as well as the intellect of the
commander.

Chapter Four, “On Danger in War,” suggests in a few paragraphs the

impediments to thinking that result from the sound of bullets hissing round
one’s head and from the sight of men being killed and mutilated. In such an
atmosphere “the light of reason is refracted in a manner quite different from
that which occurs in academic speculation.”

Chapter Five tells of the friction that derives from the often unbelievable

physical effort in war. It concerns both the efforts that a general can demand
of his troops, who on forced marches or in battle are usually beset with
many forms of misery, and the effects of weariness upon himself and upon
his sensibilities.

war,” the perennial inadequacies and inaccuracies of intelligence.
Clausewitz tells us that “as a rule most men would rather believe bad news
than good,” and that if a commander does not have a buoyant disposition,
“he had better make it a rule to suppress his personal convictions, and give
his hopes and not his fears the benefit of the doubt.” One wonders again
whether Clausewitz is here telling us something about himself. He was not
of a “buoyant disposition,” and perhaps for that reason he was as a senior
officer invariably in a staff rather than a command position.

chapters were leading up to, “Friction in War.” This is one of the most taut
and inspired of his chapters. In war, he says, everything is simple, “the
strategic options are so obvious, that by comparison the simplest problem of
higher mathematics has an impressive scientific dignity.” Yet what is simple
is also difficult. “Action in war is like movement in a resistant element. Just
as the simplest and most natural of movements, walking, cannot easily be
performed in water, so in war it is difficult for normal efforts to achieve
even moderate results.” Also, “every war is rich in unique episodes; each is
an uncharted sea beset with reefs. The commander may suspect the reefs’
existence, without ever having seen them; now he must steer past them in
the dark.” Though his progress may be only by virtue of overcoming great
difficulties, “from a distance everything may seem to be proceeding
automatically.” Resistance is “a force that theory can never quite define,”
and that makes every precise theory irrelevant. The author promises to
return often to this subject.

Chapter Eight, which concludes Book One, deals with the problems of

gaining during peacetime relevant experience for all ranks but especially for
commanding officers. “It is immensely important that no soldier ... should
wait for war to expose him to those aspects of active service that amaze and
confuse him when he first comes across them.”

have expanded appreciably the last five chapters of Book One. Each is only
a few paragraphs long, but each, except perhaps for the concluding Chapter
Eight, seems to say all that needs to be said on its subject. It remains to be
added that few other writers on strategy have even mentioned the
“frictions” caused by danger and personal hardship, though many have been
obsessed with the difficulties caused by faulty intelligence. The chapter
devoted directly to the subject of frictions is a real gem, and explains,
among other things, why Clausewitz was so averse to the compounding of
maxims and axioms and to the people who engaged in it.

BOOK TWO: ON THE THEORY OF WAR

 
When Clausewitz, in the “Notice” of 10 July 1827 found with his
manuscript after his death, described the first six books as they then existed
as being “a rather formless mass that must be thoroughly revised again,” he
was not indulging in vain self-depreciation. The standard by which he was
measuring himself was undoubtedly high, but not unrealistic, for we see it
realized in most of Book One and especially the only chapter he regarded as
finished. In that chapter, and to a moderately less extent in the rest of Book
One, the structure is taut, the ideas clear but densely packed in with no
excess of verbiage, and they flow one from the other with the utmost logical
coherence. There is not in those portions the “good deal of superfluous
material” that he speaks of in the “Notice.” In Book Two, however, as in
various of the succeeding books, we see a different kind pf writing. We are
most decidedly still dealing with a Clausewitz, who has set down “the fruit
of years of reflection on war and diligent study of it,” but we are also
dealing with an unfinished manuscript. It is not the “formless mass” he
called it, but it is less well organized than it could be, and we do
occasionally find it repetitious. Unquestionably these characteristics have
contributed to the difficulty that some have found in reading or
understanding Clausewitz, and this difficulty is best overcome by facing
frankly the reason for it.
  

Book Two, Chapter One: This chapter is, for example, given over to some

definitions and distinctions which do not much advance the argument.
There are a few well-etched and highly quotable sentences, such as the one
in the first paragraph which reads: “Fighting ... is a trial of moral and
physical forces through the medium of the latter.” Also, he sets down twice,
in related though different language, the distinction between tactics and
strategy. In his first try he calls tactics “the study of the employment of
fighting forces in battle,” and strategy he describes as “the study of the
employment of battles for the object of the war” (his own italics).

more interesting. It describes in broad and general terms the unsatisfactory
nature of strategic studies prior to his own. He does not mention names, but
he seems at different times to be speaking of Louis XIV’s great master of
siege warfare, the Marquis de Vauban; of Louis XV’s Marshal Maurice de
Saxe; of Frederick the Great, of Clausewitz’s immediate predecessor, Count
Dietrich von Bülow; and of his contemporary, Jomini. Among them and
others he sees differences, and even advances, but in general he finds their
ideas confining, that is, not taking account of the “endless complexities”
involved in war, and also “pertaining only to physical matters and unilateral
activity.” It is particularly important, he says, to take account of the fact that
in war “everything is uncertain and calculations have to be made with
variable quantities,” that “all military action is intertwined with
psychological [or ”moral“] forces and effects,” and that war consists of “a
continuous interaction of opposites”—of opposites, moreover, representing
very different degrees of talent.

One must, he insists, eschew doctrines which presume to provide a

manual for action. He indeed believes in theory, but only in the kind that
develops out of long study of the history of war. Theory exists, he says, to
“distinguish precisely what at first sight seems fused.” With good theory
one absorbs new material and experience without having to start afresh each
time. It is, in other words, a way of promoting insights by organizing
experience in one’s mind. This kind of theory serves the future commander
by guiding him in his self-education but it is not suitable for accompanying
him to the battlefield. In short, it is a matter of training the mind rather than
filling it with doctrine.

If all this seems nebulous and impractical, it should suffice to point out

that Clausewitz is really describing an experience which many undergo but
few perceive—the subtler effects of education on the mind. Education,
almost regardless of the field of specialization, undoubtedly enhances our
intellectual sensibilities, and one of the ways in which it does so is by
expanding our awareness of connections between events or insights remote
in time and in circumstance. In any field, theory is valuable to the degree
that it promotes such expanded awareness in a specialized form and avoids
falling into pedanticism or dogma. Clausewitz says almost the same thing: a

sensible teacher is one “who guides and stimulates a young man’s
intellectual development, but is careful not to lead him by the hand for the
rest of his life.” He is not averse to principles and rules if “truth
spontaneously crystalizes into these forms.” It is the imposed kind of
crystalization that alarms him.

He proposes to begin a theory of war by studying the relationship of

means and ends, first in tactics and then in strategy. The purpose of doing
so is mostly to exclude irrelevancies. The conduct of war, for example, has
to do with the use of guns, but not with how to make them. Similarly,
“strategy uses maps without worrying about trigonometric surveys.” This
simplification of relevant areas incidentally explains, in Clausewitz’s view,
“why in war men have so often successfully emerged in the higher ranks,
and even as supreme commanders, whose former field of endeavor was
entirely different.” Clausewitz does not offer us names, but he could have
been thinking of Cromwell, of Cromwell’s sea commander Blake, and of
any number of warrior kings from Alexander the Great to the great monarch
of his own Prussia, Frederick II. The last named until his accession to the
throne had been far more interested in music and in French literature than in
things military. This bemusement with men who became great commanders
with the barest minimum of preparation brings Clausewitz perilously close
to denying, or at least appearing to deny, the value of any kind of
intellectual preparation. As one writer has said of his work, “the expressed
aim of these hundreds of pages of vast erudition is to impress on the mind
of the reader the futility of all book-learning.”132 Well, it is not quite so.
Before this chapter ends Clausewitz has insisted, first, that “no great
commander was ever a man of limited intellect,” and second, that the
natural talent, where it exists, must develop the capability for making
appropriate decisions, which means that it must be “trained and educated by
reflection and study.”

Book Two, Chapter Three: Clausewitz takes up the now familiar question

whether the conduct of war is an art or a science, and he concludes that
while it is more the former than the latter it is really neither. It is, he says, a
clash of interests, and then he curiously compares it to commerce, which he
also calls “a clash of human interests and activities”! He is, of course,
expressing pure mercantilist sentiment. He had not got round to reading

Adam Smith’s great work, published four years before his birth.
Nevertheless, his essential point is valid: war is not an exercise of will
directed at inanimate matter (which presumably is his definition of art) but
rather will directed “at an animate object which reacts.” The same basic
tenet is what distinguishes modern game theory from simple probability
theory.
  

Book Two, Chapter Four: Following some brief definitions of terms,

Clausewitz points out that in the theory of war, “there can be no formulation
general enough to deserve the name of law.” However, principles and rules
do apply, though more to tactics than to strategy. They are useful to bear in
mind as supports, but they are not to be dogmatically applied to every
situation. Routine, too, can be useful, especially with respect to junior
officers, for routine methods “will steady their judgment, and also guard
them against eccentric and mistaken schemes which are the greatest menace
in a field where experience is so dearly bought.” In the absence of good
theory, routine will affect even the major decisions of the highest ranks.
Although a great commander is entitled to his personal style, when other
commanders ape that style they may be adopting a meaningless routine. As
an example Clausewitz offers the defeat which had been a bitter personal
experience for him. He was present at Jena in 1806, when the Prussian
commanders, following the tactical routines of Frederick the Great,
presented their army for destruction by Napoleon.
  

Book Two, Chapter Five: This important chapter presents at the

beginning some slight extra dimensions of difficulty in the reading, because
Clausewitz is philosophically sophisticated enough to know that questions
of cause and effect are more complex than laymen usually assume them to
be. The subject is criticism of past campaigns or battles, which the author
finds a good way of studying military theory, partly because the theoretical
ideas upon which any criticism has to be based become more familiar
through repeated application. However, because criticism is fundamentally
concerned with the clear tracing out of causes and effects, it is worthless
unless based on an accurate and adequately comprehensive narrative of the
events under study. The critic must use his theoretical concepts as the
soldier should use them—as aids to judgment and not as laws. Clausewitz

does not fail to ring in once again the idea that inasmuch as all military acts
are designed to produce certain ends, in “those involving great and decisive
actions, the analysis must extend to the ultimate objective, which is to bring
about peace.”

possible ... cannot be left out of account.” The author takes as an example
Bonaparte’s campaign of 1797 through Italy into Austria, and in passing
makes the fundamentally Clausewitzian observation that in 1797, as
contrasted with the situation Bonaparte encountered in Moscow in 1812,
“the secret of the effectiveness of resisting to the last had not yet been
discovered.” He uses another example, Bonaparte’s lifting the siege of
Mantua in 1796 in order to fall on some relieving columns, to show how the
tyranny of fashion can prevent one’s mind from considering valid
alternative possibilities. The tyranny of bias can have the same effect, as
proved with another example from Bonaparte’s campaign, this one in 1814.

or blame to the commander, which is difficult or impossible to do with
justice because the critic cannot put himself mentally into the situation of
the participant. One conspicuous difference is that he knows the outcome.
“An analyst should ... not check a great commander’s solution to a problem
as if it were a sum in arithmetic.” It may be useful, even unavoidable, to
discuss particular actions or decisions in terms which suggest praise or
blame, but, particularly with respect to an outstanding commander, the critic
must avoid implying that he would have done better.

The difference between Bonaparte’s disastrous failure in the Moscow

campaign of 1812 and his successes in earlier campaigns such as Austerlitz
(1805), Friedland (1807), and Wagram (1800) was less a matter of varying
strategies than of the fact that in the earlier campaigns he had gauged his
enemy correctly while in that of 1812 he had not. This is proved simply by
the outcomes (Clausewitz will return to this theme in Chapter Nine of Book
Eight). Still, in war all action is aimed at probable rather than at certain
success, and there are times when the utmost daring is the height of
wisdom.

Clausewitz closes this chapter by reviewing three common errors of

critics. The first he states only after once again reviewing the fallacies of
using principles or rules as rigid external guides to conduct rather than as

aids to training a commander’s (or critic’s) mind. “One should never
elaborate scientific guidelines as though they were a kind of truth machine.”
The second is the overuse of jargon, technicalities, and metaphors, where
the critic “no longer knows just what he is thinking and soothes himself
with obscure ideas which would not satisfy him if expressed in plain
speech.” The third is the misuse and abuse of historical examples, where the
critic drags in three or four alleged examples from remote times and places
just to show off his erudition. Obscure and usually at least partially false,
these examples make only a negative impression on the practical military
man whom they are presumably intended to benefit.

the conduct of war; it must avoid spurious claims and unseemly displays of
scientific formulae and historical compendia; and it must stick to the point
and never part company with “those who have to manage things in battle by
the light of their native wit.” We observe that Clausewitz, for all the charges
made against him of being over-philosophic, was determined to write a
book that was practical.
  

Book Two, Chapter Six: In this concluding chapter of Book Two,

Clausewitz develops a point made negatively in the previous chapter, where
he says one of the three cardinal errors common to critics is their misuse of
historical examples. Here he proposes to demonstrate their correct use.

“The knowledge which is basic to the art of war,” he says, “is empirical.”

Thus, the nature of war is revealed to us only by historical experience. We
can study means, like the physical effects of shot fired from guns, but this
will not inform us, as historical example will, of the differences between
seasoned troops and raw troops in the steadiness with which they stand up
to artillery fire. To be sure, we do not always have a sufficient range of
experience to inform us sufficiently about all the things we should like to
know. It is incidentally interesting that Clausewitz, who did not know rapid
technological change in the tools of war, rather inverts the point we should
be inclined to make today concerning the utility of historical example to
justify a change from accustomed usage. Where methods have proved
highly effective and thus become fashionable, he says, we should want to
have good reasons, meaning such as can be drawn from history, for
changing them. The argument has an odd ring in an age of nuclear weapons

—though it may well be that for changes less drastic his point still would
hold. As we have seen, in an age of steam-driven, steel warships Mahan
compounded a cogent and valid body of naval theory derived almost
exclusively from naval warfare in days of sail.

There are, says Clausewitz, four different uses for historical examples.

The first is simply to explain an idea which is otherwise too abstractly
stated, and the second is to show the application of an idea so that we can
see the play of minor circumstances such as would not be included in a
general formulation. These two have in common the fact that the historical
example need not be altogether accurate or authentic, because there is no
desire to prove anything. In these cases the example is simply an expository
aid.

or effect, and in the fourth one wants to deduce a rule or doctrine, where the
proof can only lie in the historical evidence itself. Here one needs accurate
history, but in the third case a single example may suffice while in the
fourth the demands are much more stringent. In the fourth case one needs a
fair number of supporting cases and an absence or paucity of opposing
ones, and moreover, in each case “care must be taken that every aspect
bearing on the truth at issue is fully and circumstantially developed.”

The main trouble with the common practice of touching lightly upon

many different historical events is less that readers do not know enough
about them to evaluate the author’s judgment than that the author himself
has never mastered the events he cites. “Such superficial, irresponsible
handling of history leads to hundreds of wrong ideas and bogus theorizing.”
Better a single thoroughly detailed event than ten that are only touched
upon. For these and related reasons, it is also better to use events from
recent rather than remote military history. Not only is recent history better
known, but the conditions, including those respecting armaments, are also
more like the present. For Clausewitz this means examples beginning with
the War of the Austrian Succession (1740- 1748), which happened also to
be the first of the wars of Frederick the Great. This encompasses only about
seventy-five years of military history (which perforce ends with Waterloo),
but he admits that more remote times, including antiquity, are not absolutely
excluded, depending on what it is we want to derive from that history.

considering. Those who refer lightly to events remote in history rarely
demonstrate “any honesty of purpose, any earnest attempt to instruct or
convince.” They are usually just showing off. But what would Clausewitz
have made of most of the post-Second World War writers on strategy, who,
far from making excessive pretensions to knowledge of military history,
seem not to feel naked in the absence of any knowledge at all of such
history?

BOOK THREE: ON STRATEGY IN GENERAL

deeper meaning of strategy as well as of military genius. The important
thing is to keep one’s eye on the goal, both as a participant and as a critic,
and to see by what course of behavior and by what gifts of insight and
decision the talented commander achieves his goal.

“Everything in strategy,” Clausewitz says again, “is very simple; but that

does not mean that everything is very easy. Once it has been determined,
from the political conditions, what a war is meant to achieve and what it can
achieve, it is easy to chart the course. But great strength of character, as
well as great lucidity and firmness of mind, is required in order to follow
through steadily, to carry out the plan, and not to be thrown off course by
thousands of diversions.”

In Frederick the Great’s campaign of 1760 (mid-course in the Seven

Years War) it is his rapid marches and maneuvers that are always praised,
when the real proof of his wisdom is the fact that in “pursuing a major
objective with limited resources, he did not try to undertake anything
beyond his strength.” The maneuvers are indeed worthy of praise, though
not for the concepts they exposed but rather for the boldness, resolution,
and strength of will that enabled this king to carry them out. Such miracles
of execution, he says, can be spontaneously appreciated only by those with
actual experience in war.

The latter thought, we may add, is the key to Clausewitz’s constant

emphasis on the importance of practical experience, an emphasis that has
made some of his interpreters wonder whether he thought that anything of
value for the theory of war could be got out of books! He expected most of
his readers to have had the experience, and the others to understand what is
lacking from the absence of it. “Those who know war only from books or
the parade-ground cannot recognize these impediments to action; so we
must ask them to accept on faith what they lack in experience.”

adds to the constraints upon the enemy. On the other hand, if we lose sight
of the ultimate goal and succumb to the idea that the captured provinces are
of value in themselves, we may ignore the possibility that their possession
may lead later to definite disadvantages. What is important is not the
isolated advantage but the final balance. Clausewitz undoubtedly had many
examples in mind from his own observation—like Napoleon’s success in
taking Moscow—but we have also seen in our own day the truth of his
observations. The islands and other territories seized by Japan following her
Pearl Harbor attack in December, 1941 turned out to be liabilities in the
latter stages of the Second World War, when her garrisons were isolated and
immobilized. More recently, Israel’s conquest of the Sinai in the 1967 war
resulted in a grave disadvantage in the 1973 war, for it meant, among other
things, taking over extra logistics problems that had previously been solely
the enemy’s burden. Besides, the 1967 war had suggested that during battle
it is better to have a terrible desert at the enemy’s back than at one’s own.
By sending his army across that desert, President Nasser had too clearly
revealed his hostile intentions, and when his forces broke under attack it
was the desert that annihilated them.

Book Three, Chapters Two-Seven: The very brief Chapter Two must be

interpreted simply as a disdainful rejection of some of Clausewitz’s
predecessors and contemporaries, especially von Bülow. Chapter Three,
“Moral Factors,” restates a theme which Clausewitz reemphasizes
throughout his work and on which he knew he did not stand alone.
However, he complains that other theorists neglect it, and it is true that his
contemporaries, including Jomini, threw the emphasis on “principles,”
which is to say on procedures. Nevertheless, the glory always reaped by
successful leaders in war has been a spontaneous recognition of the
qualities that Clausewitz and other military writers have called “moral”—
which, of course, in this sense has nothing to do with ethics.

Certainly, too, the great majority of writers on strategy since Clausewitz

have not failed to recognize the importance of this quality even when
discussing other things—sometimes, as in the case of Foch, making rather
too much of it as compared with other things. Still, it was not vainglory that
made Wellington exclaim to his friend Thomas Creevey on the morning
after Waterloo that the battle would not have been won “if I had not been

there.” Nor did he doubt that with a partner less determined than Blücher to
come to his assistance it would also not have been won. Clausewitz had
witnessed that determination on that occasion —he was then chief of staff
to Thielmann, one of Blücher’s corps commanders—as he had witnessed it
on many other occasions in the preceding two years.133

The author’s discussion of the military spirit of the army amazes us for

its modernity. In matters psychological Clausewitz is always the keenest
and also the most measured of observers. “An army’s efficiency,” he says,
“gains life and spirit from enthusiasm for the cause for which it fights, but
such enthusiasm is not indispensable.” Then, after delineating what it is that
creates the “true military spirit” and describing its importance, he goes on to
say, as only Clausewitz would among all the classic writers on strategy, “It
cannot be maintained that it is impossible to fight a successful war without
these qualities. We stress this in order to clarify the concept, so as not to
lose sight of the ideas in a fog of generalities and give the impression that
military spirit is all that counts in the end.... The spirit of an army ... is a
tool whose power is measurable” (italics added). By “measurable” the
author naturally does not mean that he can quantify it with numbers, but
simply that the significance of even the most important things can be
exaggerated. The same idea can be put truistically: where several qualities
(in an army and its leadership) are important, no one quality can be all-
important. However, other writers do not keep straight these simple truisms.

There are only two sources for military spirit: one is a series of victorious

campaigns, and the second, “frequent exertions of an army to the utmost
limits of its strength.” The latter seems startling, but “a soldier is just as
proud of the hardships he has overcome as of the dangers he has faced.” We
are hearing again the voice of long experience. Clausewitz knew very well
what it meant to be in armies driven to the limits of their endurance, which
by virtue both of their exertions and their victories could “survive the
wildest storms of misfortune and defeat.” We should take care, he says
finally, “never to confuse the real spirit of an army with its mood.”

In Chapter Six, “Boldness,” however, he seems to have trouble making

up his mind. He does not doubt that boldness is desirable in the lower ranks
where it is also most readily found. There it can be held in check, but
meanwhile it “acts like a coiled spring, ready at any time to be released.”

With the top ranks the situation is different, and here the author displays a
quite unwonted ambivalence. Obviously, we have a Clausewitz who is
struggling with his own temperament.

He knew the value of boldness in a commander, but he could not help

wanting to see that boldness “disciplined by reflection.” The result is a
series of fine distinctions which are hardly practical even if meaningful—
for example, the threefold distinction between “boldness,” “deliberate
caution,” and “timidity”—and another series of statements which are
plainly contradictory. In the net he wants to be recorded in favor of
boldness, and he makes some eloquent statements in favor of that
disposition. But then he says: “Boldness governed by superior intellect is
the mark of a hero. This kind of boldness does not consist in defying the
natural order of things and in crudely offending the laws of probability.”
What it does consist of is then described in somewhat mystical terms and
generalities, a quality normally much more characteristic of other
nineteenth and twentieth century writers on strategy than of Clausewitz. In
the end we know that he believes “a distinguished commander without
boldness is unthinkable,” and he also calls this quality “the first prerequisite
of the great military leader.” It is at any rate remarkable that he should have
been able to pay such tribute, albeit modestly qualified, to a quality he
probably knew he did not possess.

The man who had taken part in the Russian campaign in 1812 and in the
campaigns in western Europe in 1813, 1814, and 1815 knew what he was
speaking of when he said “there is hardly a worthwhile enterprise in war
whose execution does not call for infinite effort, trouble, and privation.”
  

Book Three, Chapter Eight: In this chapter, “Superiority of Numbers,”

we are clearly back to the Clausewitz of the sure touch. He first tells us
what we already know, that a brilliant commander has often won an
engagement over an inferior opponent even though greatly outnumbered.
But, he points out—what we may too easily forget—there is a limit to
which brilliance of leadership can compensate for inferiority in numbers, at
least among European armies which tend to be comparable in other
respects. Thus, examples show that “even the most talented of commanders
will find it difficult to defeat an opponent twice his strength.” We must,

therefore, acknowledge that in ordinary cases “a significant superiority of
numbers ... will suffice to assure victory, however adverse the other
circumstances.” This means that the first rule of strategy should be to put
the largest possible army into the field.

us, in his time it was not really a platitude. He gives us the intriguing
information that to most military historians down to the end of the
eighteenth century, the strength of armies seemed not to be of major
significance. They rarely mentioned it, even when they offered all sorts of
other details. Some authors seemed even to believe “that there is a certain
optimum size for an army, an ideal norm, and that any troops in excess of it
are more trouble than they are worth.” Besides, we know that there were
battles in which not all forces available were used “because numerical
superiority was not given its due importance.”

Thus we have the dual principle that one should operate with the largest

forces possible, and that the forces available must be employed with such
skill “that even in the absence of absolute superiority, relative superiority is
attained at the decisive point.” This object obviously requires appropriate
“calculations of space and time,” but obviously too, such phrases had
already become clichés in Clausewitz’s time. “Let us not,” he says “confuse
ourselves unnecessarily by conventional jargon.”

of numbers is of fundamental importance, but even that degree of
importance is still only relative. “The principle is served if we use the
greatest possible force; the question whether to avoid a fight for lack of
strength can be decided only in the light of all other circumstances.”

Book Three, Chapter Nine: Clausewitz is in agreement with all other

writers on strategy concerning the universal desirability of achieving
surprise, but he nevertheless thinks that the common emphasis on it is
somewhat overdone. The reason is that it is much more difficult to achieve
than is generally assumed. “The principle is highly attractive in theory, but
in practice it is often held up by the friction of the whole machine.” Its
success is often due to favorable circumstances beyond the control of the
commander, and it is frequently at the mercy of chance.

Surprise is also primarily a tactical device. “In strategy surprise becomes

more feasible the closer it occurs in the tactical realm, and more difficult the

more it approaches the higher levels of policy.” Thus, while “surprise lies at
the root of all operations without exception,” it does so “in widely varying
degrees depending on the nature and circumstances of the operation.”

—which was often significantly different from that of the military historians
of his time, who tended always to inflate the instances of surprise—but we
can use some examples from our own time which bear out convincingly
what Clausewitz had to say on the subject, especially with respect to the
greater ease of achieving surprise as we go from strategy to tactics, and also
the bearing of favorable circumstances.

American Allies would soon land on the northern coast of France. The
Allied High Command had gone to great lengths to conceal their intentions,
but it was impossible for many months before the event to conceal the fact
that the invasion was going to occur, and the Germans had good grounds for
guessing the approximate time and the approximate area (that is, the
Channel coast rather than the Atlantic coast of France). Thus, in the higher
strategic realm there was no surprise. The Allies did achieve some surprise
in the exact timing of their landings (otherwise Field Marshal Rommel
would not have been away from his post) and also the exact locations; but
the most important surprise achieved was in the fact that the original
simultaneous landings on the Normandy coast were not the feint that the
Germans thought they might be but the whole affair. Thus, the Germans
held in reserve too long some divisions that would have been much more
effective if thrown earlier into the fight.

as well as tactical—more so than it should have been. The United States
Government knew, and its senior commanders in the field were warned, that
war was imminent. It was taken as likely that the Japanese would initiate
the war with a sudden attack somewhere, as they had initiated the Russo-
Japanese War in 1904 with a surprise attack upon the Russian Far Eastern
Fleet at Port Arthur. Why, then, should not reasonable precautions have
been taken against exactly the kind of attack that did occur? The tactical
method of attack was a surprise, though it should not have been. Such an
attack had even figured in a U. S. fleet exercise some years earlier but had
effectively been put out of mind.

as much as possible at sea, as the American carriers happened to be on the
day of the attack (in this respect chance operated against the Japanese). But
the American fleet commander and his aides apparently could not think in
terms of Japanese aircraft over a naval base so far from Japan. Thus, even
disregarding the remarkable chance circumstance that a radar sighting of
incoming aircraft was ignored, the Japanese reliance on surprise was a
fairly desperate gamble which they happened to win.

As it turned out, the Japanese could hardly have more effectively inspired

a warlike determination and unity in the theretofore divided United States.
That was an excessive price to pay for destroying or disabling some old
battleships that were relatively soon repaired or replaced —but now we are
in the realm of the connection between strategy and politics, which
Clausewitz treats in other chapters.

stratagems, Clausewitz is again strikingly negative, for reasons which have
to do with the economy of war. He is speaking of strategic rather than
tactical stratagems, and he feels that the only kind that is likely to have
much effect by way of deception is one that deploys not words but a
substantial force. But, he says, “it is dangerous ... to use substantial forces
over any length of time merely to create an illusion; there is always the risk
that nothing will be gained, and that the troops deployed will not be
available when they are really needed.”

in war and the general’s character. We notice it, for example, in his
conclusion “that an accurate and penetrating understanding is a more useful
and essential asset for the commander than any gift for cunning—though
the latter will do no harm so long as it is not employed, as it all too often is,
at the expense of more essential qualities of character.” He does, to be sure,
seem to commend cunning when the commander is so weak as to be
otherwise without hope.

about using substantial forces separately for diversion, not all stratagems
have been of this nature. Clausewitz was certainly familiar with instances
where Marlborough and Frederick the Great successfully used deceptive
movements of whole armies, and other ruses as well.

conforming with though probably not inspired by Clausewitz’s ideas,
occurred at the naval Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. Admiral Ozawa
presented a decoy force to the north of the Philippine Archipelago which
lured Admiral Halsey and his entire Third Fleet away from the strait 300
miles to the south through which Admiral Kurita, who had already been
sighted and attacked, would sortie on the following morning. Ozawa’s
mission was apparently based on the hope that Halsey would be ruled by
two clichés then dominant in the American fleet—and he was. The first of
these, valid in the earlier stages of the war but now obsolete, was the
maxim: “the enemy’s main force is where his carriers are.” The carriers
Ozawa had were the only four left in the Japanese navy, and of these three
were very small and the fourth not large; the aircraft they carried were few
and manned by poorly trained pilots. Moreover, Halsey’s staff had the
information to deduce these facts. Ozawa’s force was thus too weak to serve
as anything but a decoy, and Ozawa had no confidence it could do even
that. Kurita’s seven powerful battleships and eleven heavy cruisers as well
as other ships undoubtedly constituted the main Japanese force.

fleet in the presence of the enemy—the old principle of “concentration of
force.” With his overwhelming strength he could easily have divided his
fleet and still presented a vastly superior force to each of the forces led by
Ozawa and Kurita, as two of his subordinates tried to hint he should do.
Kurita did sortie through San Bernardino Strait and was in a position to
wreak havoc with the American shipping and moderate naval forces
covering the landing on Leyte, but he lost his resolve and at the last moment
turned back. Thus, despite Ozawa’s success in his ruse, Halsey escaped the
full penalty for his error; but his cost was that of failing to destroy either
Ozawa’s force (he had been obliged to turn around before reaching him) or
Kurita’s.
  

Book Three, Chapters Eleven-Thirteen: The extraordinary brevity of

Chapter Eleven, the “Concentration of Forces in Space,” suggests that this
was an initial statement which Clausewitz intended to fill in with his final
revision; but it is possible also that he considered this subject so well known
and agreed upon that he did not wish to waste undue space on it even in a

finished version. Here we have Clausewitz, normally so disdainful of
“principles of war,” accepting one of them without hesitation or much
qualification as basic. The qualification which does appear is, however,
extremely important. Although “there is no higher and simpler law of
strategy than that of keeping one’s forces concentrated,” that does not mean
keeping them concentrated when there is a definite and urgent need to do
otherwise—a subject he promises to amplify in a later chapter (he does,
modestly, in several chapters, but especially Chapter Nine of Book Eight).

The next chapter, “Unification of Forces in Time,” takes up on the

tactical level the importance in battle of keeping some forces in reserve.
Thus, one has one’s forces concentrated on the field of battle, but one does
not use them all at once. Later, in the discussion of “economy of force,” we
shall learn that it is equally important that one should see that all are used.
Clausewitz’s discussion of concentration or unification of forces on the
strategic level lacks clarity, which may be due to its being unfinished. He
seems to be saying that inasmuch as a comparable need for keeping fresh
troops in reserve does not exist on the strategic level, all forces available
should be put in motion toward the strategic goal from the onset of the war.
His meaning gains some clarification from his example of Napoleon’s
march into Russia in 1812, where the author is apparently answering
criticisms that among Napoleon’s errors was that of using too large an army.
Clausewitz argues that it was the method of advance, along a narrow rather
than a broad front, that should be criticized rather than the size of the army.
Napoleon could not know the minimum level of forces that would be
clearly sufficient, so he was right to send in as large an army as he could
gather. Anyway, as the author points out in another chapter, the force that
finally arrived at Moscow was much diminished from that which crossed
the Niemen.

making here and the criticisms voiced by some military persons concerning
the slow buildup of United States military forces in Vietnam following the
decision in March 1965 to send in combat forces. There critics say that the
reserves should have been called out at once and that the maximum level of
over half a million men in Vietnam reached only in 1968 should have been
reached much sooner. This argument lacks merit, partly because it
implicitly denies the legitimacy of domestic political constraints affecting

United States participation in Vietnam and even more because it makes no
effort to explain what that number of men could have accomplished in 1965
that it failed to accomplish in 1968. Nevertheless, the Clausewitzian idea
described above deserves notice.

to be contradictory to the previous one, but this impression is quickly
dispelled. There can, the author says, be some use for a strategic reserve,
but only when emergencies are conceivable. When, one may ask, are they
not conceivable in wartime? The author answers that “uncertainty decreases
the greater the distance between strategy and tactics; and it practically
disappears in that area that borders on the political.” Again his meaning is
clarified by his example—and we sense again what a searing experience for
him was the Jena defeat of 1806. During that campaign, in which the
identity of the enemy and his purpose were clear and not subject to change,
the Prussians kept two substantial forces in strategic reserve which never
saw action.
  

Book Three, Chapter Fourteen: The example just given from the Jena

campaign could serve also to illustrate the argument of the following and
very brief chapter, “Economy of Force.” We see again that Clausewitz’s
rejection of the idea that a theory of war can rest on a body of “principles”
of near-universal application does not prevent him from including those
principles in his own theory.

has continued to appear in the standard lists of principles down to the
present day. Significantly, however, recent writers usually show their lack
of understanding of the matter by twisting the meaning of the word
“economy” almost to the opposite of that originally intended, which was
not that of economizing or of niggardly use but rather of effective use. In
war, Clausewitz says, one must “make sure that all forces are involved ...
that no part of the whole force is idle.” Forces which are not busy with the
enemy “are being wasted, which is even worse than using them
inappropriately,” for forces which are used inappropriately are at least
occupying some of the enemy forces and reducing his overall strength.
Most writers in our time have mistakenly interpreted the old phrase
“economy of force” to mean applying only the minimum necessary strength

for the task—a concept that makes sense only for diversionary or holding
operations, where the object is to maximize concentrations elsewhere.

the principle of economy of force. In the battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras
two days before Waterloo, Count D’Erlon with 20,000 men marched back
and forth between the two battlefields because of a confusion of orders and
took part in neither action. Napoleon desperately wanted him at Ligny.
During the Waterloo battle Wellington never recalled Prince Frederick of
the Netherlands with some 17,000 men whom he had sent to a position
some ten miles to his right because he had originally expected Napoleon to
come from that direction. However, Napoleon outdid him in wasting troops
by again dictating a confusing order which detached 33,000 men, later
additionally reinforced, to march under Grouchy against Wavre, from which
Blücher and most of his forces had already departed to march on Waterloo.
The famous example from the First World War was von Moltke’s detaching
two army corps from his right wing advancing into France in order to send
them to the forces resisting the Russian incursion into East Prussia, but
these large forces were still on their trains moving across Germany when
the decisive battles were fought both in the East, where without them the
Germans annihilated two Russian armies at Tannenburg and the Masurian
Lakes, and in the West, where the Germans felt their absence in suffering
the defeat of the Marne which spelled the ruination of the Schlieffen Plan.
We have already given a naval example from the Second World War, when
Admiral Halsey took his great Third Fleet on a high-speed dash three
hundred miles to the north against Ozawa, but stopped before reaching him
and turned to pursue Kurita, whom he also never reached. The Third Fleet
on that occasion used up plenty of fuel but no ammunition, and as an
organized force it never got another chance. Some of these examples border
on the tactical rather than the strategic, but the demarcation is not hard and
fast and anyway the principle is the same. There are all kinds of ways of
failing to make one’s available forces fully effective, and resorting to
movements in the wrong direction is only one of them.
  

Book Three, Chapters Fifteen-Eighteen: The brief chapter, “The

Geometrical Factor,” is little more than a rejection of the notions of von
Bülow, who wanted to make strategy “more scientific” by discussing it in

terms of geometry. Clausewitz allows that it may have some relevance to
tactics but virtually none to strategy. “We believe,” he says, “that it is one of
the chief functions of a comprehensive theory of war to expose such
vagaries.”

In the chapter that follows, “The Suspension of Action in War,”

Clausewitz is developing further a theme he has already expressed in the
great opening chapter of Book One. How does it happen that war, which
inherently calls for relentless progress toward the goal which is its object (at
least for the side initiating it), is so often marked by inactivity? Part of the
reason has already been expressed in that earlier chapter—that is, the
decision of the stronger side to postpone its offensive does not necessarily
make it appropriate for the weaker to shift to the offensive—but there are
also more fundamental reasons. In the past the absence of movement has
been mostly due to the absence of energy, that is, to the “chains of human
frailty.” With Napoleon we saw how much energy it was possible to
achieve, “and if it is possible, it is necessary.”

The main reasons for the failure of the requisite energy have to do, on the

one hand, with the fear and indecision that are native to the human mind
when confronted with risk, and on the other hand to the greater strength of
the defensive. However, there have also been wars in which both sides
lacked spirit because there was no great impetus of interest. But it is a great
mistake to regard these half-hearted kinds of endeavor as representing “the
real, authentic art of war.” To some of Clausewitz’s contemporaries the
Napoleonic wars were already being regarded “as crude brawls which can
teach nothing, and which are to be considered as relapses into barbarism.”
These people did not know what war truly is. “Woe to the government,
which, relying on half-hearted politics and a shackled military policy, meets
a foe who, like the untamed elements, knows no law other than his own
power!”

The next chapter carries this argument further. Napoleon showed the

world the real nature of war, and he prompted his opponents to rise to the
same heights of decision. Before his time the diplomats used to rush to
conclude a peace, however bad, whenever their side had lost a few battles,
but Russia in 1812 and Prussia and other nations in 1813 showed “what an
enormous contribution the heart and temper of a nation can make to the sum
total of its politics, war potential, and fighting strength. Now that

governments have become conscious of these resources, we cannot expect
them to remain unused in the future.” This is a theme to which Clausewitz
will return several times.

And in the final chapter of this book Clausewitz analyzes what can be

achieved through understanding the dynamic nature of the changes between
tension and rest in war. “Any move made in a state of tension will be more
important, and will have more results, than it would have if made in a state
of equilibrium.” Again the author uses the Jena campaign of 1806 as an
example: “During that period of enormous tension, events were pressing
towards a major decision which, with all its consequences, ought to have
absorbed the full attention of the [Prussian] commander”; yet at that very
time the Prussian leaders were dissipating their energies on confusing
schemes.

equilibrium is nothing but the reflex.”

BOOK FOUR: THE ENGAGEMENT

the “operative elements” in war, Book Four is concerned with its “essential
military activity,” which is the engagement. One could say that the shift is
from strategy to tactics, but it is obvious that Clausewitz does not sharply
separate the two, and anyway he is interested in the analysis of war and not
just of strategy. It is thus easier for him to conclude that “a change in the
nature of tactics will automatically react on strategy,” a view that separates
him considerably from Jomini and the latter’s followers, who have been so
fond of repeating the axiom that “methods change but principles are
unchanging.” But we have already seen that the principles that Clausewitz
would grant to be little affected by changes in methods are only those of the
most fundamental kind, like the principles of economy of force and of
concentration, each of which he was able to dispatch with a few paragraphs.
Clearly in his mind such concepts are only the linchpins of strategy and not
the substance.

When one considers the changes in strategy later effected by the breech-

loading rifle, which because it permitted firing from a prone position
increased the value of cover and hence the ability of small forces to delay or
hold back larger ones; of the machine-gun, which carried the process much
further and completely transformed the First World War; of submarine
warfare, which had a comparable effect on the seas in the same war, an
effect which Mahan among many others completely failed to foresee; and
of aircraft, whether carrier-based or land-based, which had a similar effect
on the Second World War (mention of nuclear weapons in this context is
really superfluous), one has to agree that it was Clausewitz who was right
on this matter and one marvels that he was able to see it so clearly even
from the relatively minor changes in tactics that occurred during his
lifetime.
  

takes up concerning the engagement is the question: What do we mean by
the defeat of the enemy? The answer for the engagement is the same as for
the war of which it forms a part—the destruction of the enemy forces.
“Admittedly, an engagement at one point may be worth more than at
another.... That is what strategy is all about.” Still, he wants to establish at
the outset the “dominance of the destructive principle”—which he feels
needs being established because there have been some long-held contrary
notions.

in some meaningful way to the destruction of one’s own. Clausewitz finds
that during the course of an engagement “the winner’s casualties ... seldom
show much difference from the loser’s”—one of the characteristics which
may have distinguished his time from our own, when there is greater
likelihood of significant differences in equipment and tactics. In his time,
“the really crippling losses which the vanquished does not share with the
victor only start with his retreat.” It is the pursuit and the fruits which fall to
it that make the difference.

and loser may share fairly evenly, but after battle they are mostly in guns
and prisoners, which are far greater on the side of the loser. “That is why
guns and prisoners have always counted as the real trophies of victory; they
are also its measure, for they are tangible evidence of its scale.”

to retreat, thus exposing itself to the heavy penalties which enemy pursuit
will bring? The loss of ground and the failure to produce fresh reserves may
bring the conviction of defeat, which means finally that “the loss of morale
has proved the major decisive factor.” The loss of morale is made worse by
retreat or flight and the enemy’s pursuit. But here much depends on
circumstances.

which rests mainly upon his great personal experience, Clausewitz
observes: “Casualty reports on either side are never accurate, seldom
truthful, and in most cases deliberately falsified.” That is one respect in
which his times differed not at all from ours.

represents for the defeated side a measured and redeemable loss, and that
rarer kind of victory on a grand scale which results in the utter debacle of
major enemy forces. As examples of the latter, he names his unforgettable
Jena and also Waterloo (which the Prussians named after the inn called
“Belle-Alliance” near the battlefield), and as an example of a large-scale
engagement which ended with only nominal defeat for one side he mentions
Borodino, the battle on the road to Moscow where Marshal Kutuzov shifted
rather than yielded his position (and which Tolstoy in his War and Peace
glorified as a victory for Kutuzov).

was to lose his life in 1870 at the head of his regiment, carried much further
the ideas that Clausewitz expressed concerning the risk of high penalty in
yielding to an enemy in battle and turning to retreat or, worse, to flee. Du
Picq arrived at his views independently from studying famous battles of
antiquity, where the loser seemed always to suffer enormously greater
losses than the victor. He decided that it was because in turning to flee the
losers presented their defenseless backs to their opponents, who pursued
and slaughtered. Quotations from du Picq’s conclusions were later
encapsulated into mottoes, like: “He will win who has the courage to
advance.” At the turn of the century the French school of Foch and his
followers fed these mottoes into the doctrine of l’offensive à outrance with
which they fought the First World War-under conditions of engagement
vastly different from those of antiquity.

Book Four, Chapters Five-Ten: These chapters require little comment,

being clear enough and also not particularly memorable. Clausewitz
continues to describe the battle that was characteristic of his time, where a
single day was enough to use up reserves and where nightfall provided
cover for the retreat of the loser. The battle wears down both sides, but one
side has in addition the agony of defeat, which is no doubt why Clausewitz
finds that “the outcome of a major battle has a greater psychological effect
on the loser than on the winner.”
  

be considered in the light of some of the military philosophies of the pre-
Napoleonic era, which to Clausewitz looked fairly recent. The great

Marshal de Saxe, who died in 1750, had written in his posthumously
published Mes Rêveries: “I do not favor pitched battles, especially at the
beginning of a war, and I am convinced that a skillful general could make
war all his life without being forced into one.” Frederick the Great, too,
became in his later years less given to offensive ardor and to the major
battle, which he found left too much to chance. Napoleon was the apostle of
the decisive battle, but the one he fought in 1815 proved his utter ruin.
Obviously, what Clausewitz was reading and hearing from some
contemporaries made him fear the renewed ascendancy of the notion that
waging campaigns without battles was “evidence of higher skill.” This line
of thought, he says, “has brought us almost to the point of regarding ... a
battle as a kind of evil brought about by mistake.”

price is blood,” and that for that reason the commander as a human being
will recoil from it. Still, inasmuch as the military aim in war is to destroy
the enemy’s forces, the battle is the only way to accomplish it. It is similarly
wrong to try to restrict military action to a series of minor engagements, for
these tend to equalize losses and draw out the affair. Clausewitz in this
chapter is justifying not simply continued fighting but the great battle, the
kind that tends to decide the outcome of the war. No other factor in war
rivals the battle in importance, “and the greatest strategic skill will be
displayed in creating the right conditions for it, choosing the right place,
time, and line of advance, and making the fullest use of its results.”

he has already treated in Chapter Four of this book, the imperative need for
pursuit after victory, and the reasons why generals so often fail to
accomplish it.

share almost equally with the losers. Clausewitz, one notices again, is more
than almost any other writer on strategy aware of the importance of
exhaustion, hunger, and general misery in the soldier—one of the factors on
which he bases his elemental conception of “friction” in Book One. The
general’s own energies have been sapped by physical and mental exertion,
which inclines him to yield to entreaties for rest and recuperation. What
does get accomplished, he says, “is due to the supreme commander’s
ambition, energy, and quite possibly his callousness.”

Also, in earlier wars, “smaller in scope and more narrowly

circumscribed,” conventions had developed which restricted all kinds of
operations and especially pursuit. “The very idea, the honor of victory,
appeared to be the whole point.... Once a decision had been reached, one
stopped fighting as a matter of course, further bloodshed was considered
unnecessarily brutal.” But such a view could prevail “only where the
fighting forces were not considered to be the vital factor,” for nothing is
clearer than that during pursuit the fleeing forces suffer disproportionately.

detour to explain why Napoleon’s action in not pursuing Kutuzov’s army
after Borodino was justified. At that point his overriding concern had to be
in reaching Moscow without more losses to his already considerably
depleted army. But this was a thoroughly exceptional situation.

his long discussion of the various forms of pursuit takes occasion to assert
that at such a time “the victor must not be afraid to divide his forces in
order to envelop everything within reach of his army.... He may do
whatever he wants until the situation changes; the more liberties he takes,
the later that moment will come.”

Again his historical examples include Jena and Waterloo (Belle-

Alliance), the latter being one of the classic pursuits in history, where the
tired Prussians under Blücher took over from the utterly spent British-Dutch
army under Wellington, and in the night following the battle Napoleon’s
army disintegrated. An example of a great opportunity missed came some
thirty-two years after Clausewitz’s death in the Battle of Gettysburg, when
after three days of fighting Meade permitted Lee to withdraw without
pressing him, though the swollen condition of the Potomac held up the
latter from crossing for seven days. Meade followed but though reinforced
and greatly superior did not attack, and Lincoln, in agony at Lee’s escape,
began again his search for an aggressive commander, looking now at the
general who had taken Vicksburg.

Book Four are rather less consequential. Chapter Thirteen considers the
strategy of the side forced into a retreat after a lost battle. First of all, one
takes measures to disengage before one’s fighting capital is all used up, so
that the withdrawal can be orderly and full of menace for the pursuer. What

is then most imperative is not putting maximum distance between oneself
and the superior enemy but rather preventing the retreat from becoming a
rout. Chapter Fourteen is in general a warning against attempting large scale
attacks at night. They are too risky and too difficult to execute.

reader is called upon rather more than in the three previous books to
distinguish between Clausewitz’s own times and our own, and this element
will continue to characterize the work until we arrive at Book Eight.

BOOK FIVE : MILITARY FORCES

Book Five deals with some of the narrower technical issues of war and
hence will appear somewhat dated in its subject matter. It will thus appeal
more to the military historian than to the modern student of war. Still, as we
shall see, it is not without passages of extraordinary interest to the latter.

In Chapter Three Clausewitz returns again to the idea that even the best

of generals rarely produces a victory when he brings inferior numbers to the
battle. Nevertheless, he says, “war is not always the result of a voluntary
policy decision,” and if one has to fight with inferior numbers, “it would be
a peculiar theory of war if it broke off just where the need for it was
greatest.” But all he has to come up with at this point is the admonition that
the more restricted the strength, the more restricted the goals and the
duration must be. “If an increase in vigor is combined with wise limitation
in objective, the result is that combination of brilliant strokes and cautious
restraint which we admire in the campaigns of Frederick the Great.”

Chapter Four, “Relationship Between the Arms of the Services,” is

fascinating because of the author’s groping toward that which is one of the
most modern developments in military studies—what we call “systems” or
“cost-effectiveness” analysis, which is somewhat related to what the
economist calls “marginal-utility” analysis. Granted that infantry is the most
versatile and indispensable of the arms, one nevertheless also has need for
artillery and cavalry. The question then arises, what constitutes the optimum
relative proportions? Then follows a dramatically modern insight: “If one
could compare the cost of raising and maintaining the various arms with the
service each performs in time of war, one would end up with a definite
figure which would express the optimum equation in abstract terms.” But,
he adds, “this is hardly more than a guessing game.” And we may add that
despite some interesting and useful modern refinements concerning more
limited areas of decision, the kind of problem that Clausewitz poses is still
today a guessing game. Clausewitz, however, goes on with the notion that

money is the common unit of account in seeking the “optimum equation”
referred to above, thus coming ever closer to the modern conception of
cost-effectiveness analysis:

... we shall simply make use of the only ascertainable factor: the money
cost. For our purpose it will suffice to state that, according to common
experience, a squadron of 150 horses, a battalion of 800 men, and a battery
of eight six-pounders cost approximately the same as to equipment and
maintenance.” Unfortunately (as is true today), the effectiveness side of the
equation is far more difficult to work out. “It might conceivably be possible
if destructiveness were all that had to be measured; but each branch has its
own particular use and thus a different sphere of effective action.”

Then, to add to the delight of the modern theorist, who is often a youthful

civilian attempting to persuade a senior military officer that he has a
superior solution to some of the problems that the latter has tended to solve
by “mature military judgment”: “People often talk of the lessons of
experience in this context, in the belief that the history of war provides
sufficient grounds for a definite answer. But that is obviously a matter of
empty phrases which, since they cannot be traced back to any fundamental
and compelling basis, are not worth considering in a critical investigation.”

over to a carefully reasoned approach to that theoretical problem which he
has just admitted defies any kind of comprehensive solution. His method is
as interesting as his conclusions, which are summarized at the end of the
chapter in four numbered propositions. Most interesting is his insight on the
declining value of cavalry relative to infantry.

but timeless in the nature of the problems that the author seeks to solve.
Here he concerns himself with the nexus between tactics and strategy
respecting primarily two problems: the need to increase the flexibility of an
army, and the desirability of shortening the chain of command. In his own
lifetime he had seen enormous changes in the organization of armies, the
trend being from huge, unwieldy masses into smaller units of which each
had its own component of the three arms—that is, infantry, artillery, and
cavalry. An army organized into corps and divisions is more easily
maneuvered, and portions thereof lend themselves more readily for

detachment on separate assignments. The questions then are: how many
corps and divisions should there be, and what should be their respective
sizes? To Clausewitz the answers are found in the characteristics of the
command problem, rather than in any fancied optimum size for the units.
The supreme commander would prefer to deal directly with division
commanders, but in a large army he may have to insert corps commanders
between himself and the division commanders, lest the division and its
component brigades become too unwieldy. Thus, the key sentence of the
chapter holds “that the number of subdivisions with equal status should be
as large as possible, and the chain of command as short as possible; the only
qualification being that command is difficult to exercise over more than
eight to ten subdivisions in an army....”

modern student of war, and Clausewitz himself apologizes at the end of
Chapter Thirteen for having put forward considerations which “are
obviously more of a tactical than a strategic nature”; but, he says, he
“thought it better to stray into the tactical field than to take the risk of not
making ourselves clear.” Still, one remembers that the army dispositions
and encampments he talks about in Chapters Six-Nine, and even more so
the marches treated in Chapters Ten-Twelve, give us insights about some of
the problems of disposition and mobility confronting armies in the field up
to and including the opening battles of the First World War. Thus, any
student of military history who is not already familiar with these matters
will gain from reading them. We learn enough here about forced marches
and about the assembly of troops at the opening of great battles to
comprehend what these phrases mean when they are tossed off by
historians, who often themselves do not fully understand them.

We also learn, as usual, the relevant changes that Clausewitz was

witnessing in his own times. It was only a generation before his time that
“the artillery went its own way in order to travel on safer and better roads,
while the cavalry generally alternated on the flanks in order to give every
unit in turn the honor of riding on the army’s right.” We also notice the
author’s sensitivity to the consequences of such changes as giving up that
part of the baggage train which had previously carried tents. It meant more
mobility for the army, and the horses previously used to draw the wagons
could draw more guns or carry more cavalry men. However, “the protection

afforded by a roof of cheap canvas may not be much, but over a period of
time it is a relief that will be missed by the troops when it is not there.” The
difference is slight for a single day, but over many days it begins to matter,
and “increased losses due to sickness will naturally result.”

of the heavy losses in the army’s strength that inevitably follow from forced
marches extending over more than a very few days, and sometimes even
within a quite short period. After poignantly describing the lot of the soldier
who falls ill on the road or who suffers parching thirst and exhaustion from
a march in the heat of summer, he adds: “None of this is meant to say that
there should be any less activity in warfare; tools are there to be used, and
use will naturally wear them out. Our only aim is clarity and order; we are
opposed to bombastic theories which hold that the most overwhelming
surprise, the fastest movement, or the most restless activity costs nothing.”
One thinks about the execution of the Schlieffen Plan in August of 1914
and wonders about the state of the German reservists by the time they had
walked, each with a 65-pound pack on his back and a rifle, through
Belgium and northeast France to the Marne. One wonders also whether
their condition, and the losses in stragglers of the German armies by the
time they reached the latter position, had been adequately taken account of
in the Plan. How many historians have raised these questions? Fortunately
for the Germans when they met the French and British along that river, the
latter had been on some excursions too.

losses in numbers of troops from forced marches during the campaigns of
1812 and 1813, in which Clausewitz took part; and gathering added interest
also because of his participation (under Thielmann) is his description in the
latter part of Chapter Thirteen of the assembly of the widely spread
Prussian army on the eve of the Battle of Ligny, which preceded that of
Waterloo by two days.

this long chapter on the provisioning of armies in the field has a special
interest. We have heard so much of great armies living off the land, of their
“moving on their bellies,” and of the great changes particularly in this
respect that distinguished the campaigns that Clausewitz saw from those of

earlier times, that we welcome the opportunity to learn something of what
was involved.

Since the time of Louis XIV (who died in 1715. just a century before

Waterloo), armies had become very large. More important, the campaigns
within any war had only recently become much more closely
interconnected, no longer separated by long periods of inactivity. Thus, the
old system of relying on depots while at rest and on huge wagon trains
during the campaigns simply could not work. The new emphasis on rapid
movement required systems of requisitioning that themselves depended on
movement. Clausewitz barely hints at one of the other things it depended on
—a certain ruthlessness toward the foreign population through which one’s
armies passed. He speaks, however, of another kind of ruthlessness, that of
the commander toward his own troops. “What can be more moving,” he
asks, “than the thought of thousands of soldiers, poorly clad, their shoulders
bent under thirty or forty pounds of pack, plodding along for days on end in
every kind of weather and on every kind of road, continuously endangering
their health and their lives, without even a crust of bread to nourish them?
When one knows how often this happens in war, one must marvel at the fact
that heart and strength do not give out more often.” Later he observes that
“a horse will perish from want much sooner than a man.”

essential spirit—with the unbridled violence that is at its core, the craving
and need for battle and decision—then feeding the troops, though
important, is a secondary matter.” He even quotes with approval Napoleon’s
impatient insistence qu’on ne me parle pas des vivres! (“let no one speak to
me of provisions!”) .

Yet in the next sentence he admits that the latter’s Russian campaign

“proved that such neglect can go too far.” For it is undeniable that “the lack
of care over supplies must be held responsible for the unprecedented
wastage of his army on the advance, and for its wholly calamitous retreat.”
Napoleon forgot “how vast a difference there is between a supply line
stretching from Vilna to Moscow ... and a line from Cologne to Paris.”
  

relationship to the important one on provisioning which immediately
precedes. They are also less dated, because in them we move away from a

conception of living off the land by requisitioning, which today is done only
by guerillas or partisans. In these chapters as in the previous one we also
observe something of the experience of the author as a staff officer.

that even where provisions can be taken or requisitioned, other military
supplies and replacements cannot be. These can only be brought forward
from a base, which thus becomes an integral part of the army, the
relationship being, in Clausewitz’s view, comparable to that of the tree with
its roots. On the other hand, the army must be mobile (which the tree is
not), and the base must not be too far behind it. Neither must it be too
vulnerable to enemy attack, which in deep penetrations into hostile territory
obviously makes for some problems.

the army to its base. Such lines provide the means of advance and also the
lines of retreat. The relevant problems deal naturally with roads—that is,
with their length, direction, and quality, but also with the terrain through
which these roads run, the condition and temper of the local inhabitants,
and finally the amount of protection to communications that can be afforded
by fortresses, where available, and by garrisons. The implication throughout
is that the enemy’s army is always somewhere out in front of one’s own, so
that unless he carries out successful flanking operations—“which have
always been more popular in books than in the field”—the protection
accorded to depots set up along the lines of communication is sufficient if it
can cope with modest detachments from the enemy’s main force or with
partisans.

Clausewitz would no doubt have modified his tone if he could have

foreseen Stonewall Jackson’s march around Pope’s army to destroy the vast
federal depot of Manassas in the events leading up to the second battle of
that name.
  

Book 
Five, 
Chapters 
Seventeen-Eighteen: These two chapters,

“Geography and Ground” and “The Command of Heights,” reveal an author
apparently less interested in the subjects he is treating than he had been in
the preceding chapters. An occasional memorable statement will be a
digression, as for example: “In war the sum-total of individual successes is
more decisive than the pattern that connects them.” In Chapter Seventeen

we learn little besides the fact that rough country makes for fragmentation
of forces and hence favors the side that can depend more on individual
initiative. It is therefore to be avoided by forces which are at an advantage
when fighting as a concentrated mass. Also, in difficult terrain infantry is
undoubtedly the ascendant arm.

ground is definitely an advantage, but the advantage is too often overrated.
“Its reality is undeniable. But when all is said and done, such expressions as
‘a dominating area,’ ‘a covering position,’ and ‘key to the country’ are,
insofar as they refer to the nature of higher or lower ground, for the most
part hollow shells lacking any sound core.” Following a renewed stress on
the relative qualities of the opposing armies and their commanders, his final
sentence in this final chapter of Book Five is: “The part played by terrain
can only be a minor one.”

In this chapter Clausewitz makes one curious error. Among the

advantages, he says, of being on high ground is that “shooting downward,
considering all the geometrical relations involved, is perceptibly more
accurate than shooting upward.” It is quite impossible to see how it should
be so on the grounds he invokes, either in his time or in ours.

BOOK SIX: DEFENSE

being the stronger form of war is likely to be treated with some reserve if
not suspicion by most members of the military profession today, as it
apparently was also in his own time. We see him complaining in Chapter
One of his view being “at odds with prevalent opinion,” and in Chapter Two
of the persistence of an “older view” by which “a battle accepted [that is,
initiated by the opponent] is regarded as already half lost.” In a later chapter
(Chapter Eighteen) we will see him speaking scornfully of “the clamor of
those whose vague emotions and still vaguer minds impel them to expect
everything from attack and movement, and whose idea of war is summed
up by a galloping hussar waving his sword.”

The modern soldier may know as a matter of practical experience that it

is sometimes necessary to assume a defensive posture (and he may even be
accustomed to seeing a “principle of security” included among the various
listings of “principles of war”) but that occasional necessity he is reluctant
to sanctify with any philosophy which imputes a special virtue to the
defensive. His indoctrination impels him to see a monopoly of virtue on the
other side. The purpose of such indoctrination is no doubt to stimulate the
strategic or tactical aggressiveness of commanders, for long experience
does suggest that few would otherwise tend on their own initiative to
provoke heavy risks, or dangers, or even exceptional effort.

The extraordinary apotheosis of the offensive that marked the thinking of

the general staffs of the First World War among the Western Allies was only
a more aberrant form of a much longer-lived conviction. The ascendancy of
this school, expressed in the prewar writings of Ferdinand Foch among
others,134 happened most tragically to occur during that one great war in
which tactical conditions made it as absurd and grotesque as it could ever
have been. In Clausewitz’s time the tactical conditions were vastly different,
and we find, indeed, that most of the advantages he attributes to the defense
tend to be strategic rather than tactical.

rises from a deep felt conviction based on the author’s personal experience,
and he does indeed mention two campaigns in which he participated. The
1812 campaign in Russia, to which he refers again in Chapter Three, was
one of the greatest triumphs of defensive strategy in all military history. In
the Waterloo campaign of 1815, too, the British-Dutch- (Belgian)-Prussian
allies successfully relied on a defensive strategy. Knowing that Napoleon
was bound to come to them, they organized and augmented their power
while awaiting him, in positions near their bases which they had thoroughly
reconnoitered and which suited their needs in other respects.

what characterizes the defensive. The defender has many opportunities for
tactical surprise, but it is the opponent who has moved against him rather
than the reverse. The object of the defensive is to preserve, which is a
negative object, and it therefore follows “that it should be used only so long
as weakness compels, and be abandoned as soon as we are strong enough to
pursue a positive object.” This assurance Clausewitz is already giving us in
Chapter One, but he insists on establishing that the weaker commander
adopts the defensive because its inherent strength tends to offset his
weakness. He gives various strategic reasons for this, mostly having to do
with the fact that the defender usually enjoys optimum lines of
communication and retreat while the attacker is extending his and usually
suffering a wastage of strength as he moves forward, and also that the
defender chooses to his own advantage the place of contact or engagement.
His clinching rhetorical argument is that if it were not the stronger form
there would never be any reason for resorting to it.

At the end of Chapter Three he grants that there is a “sense of superiority

in an army that springs from the awareness that one is taking the
initiative”—something that Foch and others were to emphasize to the
extreme—but he quickly adds that this feeling “is soon overlaid by the
stronger and more general spirit that an army draws from its victories or
defeats, and by the talent or incompetence of its commander.” He will put
the matter even stronger in Chapter Fifteen of Book Seven.

to the point he has already made in the first chapter, that defense must be
looked upon as a temporary expedient while preparing an improved basis

for going over to the attack. “A sudden powerful transition to the offensive
—the flashing sword of vengeance—is the greatest moment for the
defense.” Why then make so much of his special position on this question?
The answer comes from the contrast between his position and that of other
authors, especially the afore-mentioned Foch, who with his colleagues built
up a veritable mystique of the offensive, to which they attributed every
conceivable advantage including lower casualties. In their successive,
deadly, but futile “pushes” throughout the First World War, the allied
commanders could never get over the wholly erroneous idea that they were
inflicting more casualties on the enemy than they were suffering
themselves. They and their followers continued to insist on this point even
after the war, some of them even resorting to doctoring the figures to shield
their colleagues from embarrassing exposure.135

However, apart from these aberrant schools, what distinguishes

Clausewitz from most of his colleagues in discussing these issues is mostly
a matter of tone. Although he accepts whole-heartedly the need for going
over to the offensive if and when it becomes feasible, he does not want the
defensive posture to be despised. That it was indeed being despised, in his
time as in ours, is apparent again from his last sentence in Chapter Five:
“Thus constituted, defense will no longer cut so sorry a figure when
compared to attack, and the latter will no longer look so easy and infallible
as it does in the gloomy imagination of those to whom attack is simply
courage, determination, and movement, and defense no more than
impotence and paralysis.”

Book Six, Chapters Six-Seven: Chapter Six expands upon the reasons

mentioned in Chapters Two and Three for the superior strength of the
defensive. For one thing, certain kinds of forces can be drawn upon, like the
militia, which are not generally available to the professional army. But this
is only one example of the fact that the support of the people is more
immediately available during operations in one’s own country, which are
automatically conceived as defensive. Clausewitz mentions as one
outstanding example the war in Iberia (1808-1814), the so-called Peninsular
War, in which virtually the whole population became involved in the
struggle, furnishing innumerable guerilla bands, both in Spain and in
Portugal.

allies that one may expect on the defensive. There will be some states that
will be deeply interested in maintaining another country’s integrity simply
because their rulers feel more secure with the maintenance of the status quo.
To Clausewitz this attachment to the status quo explains the often
spontaneous development of balance-of-power involvements. “If it were
not,” he says, “for that common effort toward maintenance of the status
quo, it would never have been possible for a number of civilized states to
coexist peacefully over a period of time.... The fact that Europe as we know
it has existed for over a thousand years [instead of becoming one unified
state] can only be explained by the operation of these general interests.”
There have of course been great territorial changes, and Poland is a special
example of a considerable nation which had been (only recently in
Clausewitz’s time) eliminated as a political entity, but there were special
and instructive reasons for that. In any case, the defender can usually count
more on foreign aid than the assailant, the more so as his political and
military condition is sound.

the war takes its form and character from the defender’s denying the
assailant possession of something that the latter would normally be content
to have without war. The defender is thus “the first to commit an act which
really fits the concept of war.” Clausewitz emphasizes at this point that he is
speaking only from the point of view of theory; he naturally understands
full well that the assailant usually attacks with the assumption that his
aggressive act will provoke a military response.
  

Book Six, Chapter Eight: This long and somewhat involved chapter,

“Types of Resistance,” in good part carries forward ideas already expressed
in the preceding chapters of this book. Defense, the author says, is
composed of two distinct parts, waiting and action. But, especially in a
large-scale defensive action such as covers a whole campaign or a war, the
waiting and the action will not be separable into two distinct phases;
emphasis will alternate between the two. Clausewitz is bent on making two
fundamental points: (a) the waiting, with all the dynamics which the term is
supposed to encompass such as obliging the enemy to spend part of his
power in his advance, deserves status as an independent concept or

“principle”—it is “such a fundamental feature of all warfare that war is
hardly conceivable without it”—and (b) the benefits of the waiting rarely if
ever accrue without the action, actual or threatened.

carry on his defense. The first three, however, have in common that they
occur at or near the frontiers of the country, while the fourth has the
defender withdrawing into the interior of the country and resisting there. It
is the fourth that interests him the most and it is apparent that he has much
in mind two historic episodes, both of which he mentions and in one of
which he took part. The first is the campaign of Torres Vedras in 1810-
1811, where Wellington withdrew before Marshal Massena to the fortified
lines he had prepared in the mountains above Lisbon. There Massena
besieged him at the end of a line of communications extending the full
length of a violently hostile Spain teeming with partisan bands, only to
withdraw finally when starvation overtook his forces. The other is the epic
case that occurred in the following year, when Napoleon’s grande armée
went to Moscow and perished from starvation and cold in the retreat.

great a role as distance and the hostile physical environment in causing the
destruction of the invader—both in actual attacks and in threats of attack.
Otherwise, the invading armies would have been quite able to provision
themselves and would thus not be forced to retreat. Also, especially in
Russia, the retreat to which the invading army was finally compelled was
made enormously more costly by the haste and the disorganization that
resulted from the incessant Russian attacks.

But Clausewitz is also bemused by the cases “where there is no actual

fighting but the outcome is affected by the fact that there could be.” He
considers the situation where the invader, losing strength as he presses
forward, begins to fear that the defending opponent has become tactically
superior, and his resolution departs. He mentions several such situations;
but one thinks also of the German liquidation of the Schlieffen Plan in 1914
and the retreat to the Aisne after a battle at the Marne which was neither of
climactic ferocity nor a clear tactical victory for the French. Because of its
consequences, however, it became the “miracle of the Marne.”
  

contemporary tactics, to show the defender’s advantages which he can turn
to good account if he is not too grossly inferior—and thus to show (against
a basic assumption that he finds prevalent in his time) that the side on the
tactical defensive is not inherently less likely to win a decisive victory than
the side that initiates the attack, Clausewitz goes on to explain why such
defensive victories have rarely happened in history. In most cases the
defender is either markedly the weaker of the two or thinks he is. Curiously
he indicates what might have happened if Napoleon on the defensive at
Leipzig had been victorious, but he makes no mention of what did happen
in the great defensive victory at Waterloo. We have seen that Clausewitz
was himself at nearby Wavre on the day of that battle and taking part in a
heated defensive action against Marshal Grouchy. One can only wonder
why he does not mention the greater one of those two actions, in which the
side that was on the defensive until the very end of that long day won one
of the most decisive victories of all time.

dated than one would suspect from their titles. After describing the
difference in functions between the medieval fortress and that existing in
his own day, Clausewitz goes on to describe in Chapter Ten the several
purposes which a modern fortress can serve and in Chapter Eleven the
considerations which should govern the selection of sites for fortresses.
Obviously, these purposes and considerations have varied with time, but
less so than the reader might imagine. The Schlieffen Plan executed in 1914
was devised to outflank the great French chain of fortress cities on France’s
eastern frontier. In 1940 the German attack through Belgium and the
Ardennes was designed to outflank the Maginot Line, which was a fortified
line rather than a chain of fortresses. In each case the system channeled the
enemy attack, and if the French failed to get more profit than they did from
that fact, the fault was not altogether in the fortress idea.

No doubt fortifications have since the Second World War become less

elaborate and they have ceased to fulfill all the purposes Clausewitz
describes, but only gradually. We are frequently made aware of the failure
of fortress systems, including the examples mentioned above, but as
Clausewitz points out, whether in their direct or indirect effects fortresses
“do not make the enemy’s advance impossible; they only make it more

hazardous—in other words less likely and less dangerous to the defender.”
That too much has been expected of particular fortresses or fortifications is
a matter of historical record; but the record has to be read with care before
one can judge the utility of those systems that failed. Besides, not all
systems have failed under attack. The Turkish forts along the Dardanelles
that helped prevent the penetration of a British fleet in 1915 had weighty
consequences on the subsequent course of the First World War.

Clausewitz’s sage advice about the use of fortresses in considerable depth

rather than solely along the frontier has rarely in recent times been followed
except by small nations like Belgium—which had little enough depth to
dispose of—because the larger ones were not prepared to admit to
themselves or others that an enemy might not be stopped at their frontiers.

be more dated because they are somewhat more particularized about tactics
than the chapters on fortresses.

Book 
Six, 
Chapters 
Fifteen-Seventeen: In these three chapters,

“Defensive Mountain Warfare,” Clausewitz reveals again his pleasure in
knocking down that obvious conclusion which turns out to be full of
exceptions or plainly wrong. In this case it is the conception reflected in the
expression used by those “who speak of a gorge so narrow that a handful of
men could hold off an army.” This impression that a mountain range offers
favorable terrain for one’s major defensive effort Clausewitz denies,
exploring the matter on a tactical and strategic level with an attention to
detail which indicates on his part a close study of the matter both in
historical literature and in personal reconnoitering. Moreover, what he says
about mountain defense seems to be little altered by tactical changes since
his time.

defensive mountain warfare is intended to be relative or absolute.” Small
bodies of men can certainly slow down the progress of large forces of the
assailant, which is what he has in mind by the term “relative,” but by
“absolute” he means totally stopping the enemy or of winning a decisive
victory over him, and for this purpose mountains are generally not suited at
all.

The problems for the defense are several, which Clausewitz describes in

posts. The assailant adjusts to them, and not they to the assailant. Besides,
the position of these posts means usually that they can be held only by
infantry, which are limited to the short range of small arms fire (this factor
would be altered by modem weaponry, and yet the general proposition
would still hold). Defense forces do not occupy the ridges, which in lofty
mountains are too inaccessible, but only the valleys. Their positions there
are isolated and usually susceptible to being turned.

However, a mountain barrier can be of great aid to the defender

strategically provided he does not deploy the major part of his army within
its passes, where they are inevitably fragmented, immobile, and passive. He
should indeed make the most of what small detached forces can do to
impede the enemy within those passes but should mass his major forces in
the open country behind the barrier. “We do not maintain,” he says, “that
Spain would be stronger without the Pyrenees, but we do hold that a
Spanish army which felt it had the strength to risk a decisive battle would
be wiser to make a concentrated stand behind the Ebro than to split up
among the fifteen passes of the Pyrenees. This is not going to obviate the
effect of the Pyrenees on the war. We believe the same to hold true of an
Italian army.... No one will be ready to believe that an attacker likes to
march across a mountain massif like the Alps and to leave it in his rear.” In
his rear it makes for difficult, constricted, and precarious lines of
communications and of retreat.
  

“Defense of Rivers and Streams,” Clausewitz is writing from more direct
personal experience than he could possibly have had with mountains, and
his treatment does indeed become more detailed. However, his general
strategic conclusions are quite similar. Again he asks us to distinguish
between relative and absolute defense. Like mountains, rivers can reinforce
a limited defense; “but their peculiar characteristic is that they act like a tool
made of a hard and brittle substance: they either stand the heaviest blow
undented, or their defensive capacity falls to pieces and then ceases
completely.” Historical examples of the successful defense of rivers, he
adds, are fairly rare.

He mentions three governing factors: (a) the width of the river; (b) the

means available for crossing it; and (c) the strength of the defending force.

The attacker’s overall strength, he says, “is not relevant at this stage,”
because obviously he can get only portions of his force across initially and
the issue hangs on whether the defender is strong enough to annihilate these
portions before they are built up to a local superiority. The most significant
factor here is that there is normally little use in massing a large force to
defend a relatively short stretch of river; “any direct defense of a river must
always be extended till it amounts to a kind of cordon system.” Such an
effort can absorb large forces. After considering the problem in some depth,
he concludes that “the direct defense of a river is suitable as a rule only for
the very largest European rivers, and only on the lower half of their
courses.” On the other hand, as in the case of mountains, an advancing
army is disadvantaged from having a wide river in its rear, for its lines of
communications and of retreat may be limited to one or a few crossing
points.

In the Second World War there is no record of a river forming a

significant barrier to an invading force, for exactly the reasons Clausewitz
describes. However, the English Channel served the British very well for
four long years, the Germans lacking the power and the means to cross. On
the other hand, the British and their American allies ultimately crossed it, at
which time the German defense of the Channel shore and the failure of that
defense can be described strategically in exactly the terms Clausewitz uses
for the crossing of rivers. The Germans had to spread their defense along
the whole length of the Channel, which meant that they were not strong
enough locally to destroy the forces that the allies began to put down on
selected portions of the Normandy coast on June 6, 1944.

To consider a case at the other extreme, one wonders how the Israelis

permitted themselves to think that the Suez Canal, only 200 feet wide,
could be a meaningful barrier to the crossing of Egyptian troops, which it
conspicuously failed to be in October 1973. It argued a grotesquely low
opinion of Egyptian capabilities, which events quickly proved to need some
correction.

defense of swamps and of forests, and the defense of a territory by a
cordon. They have in common with the defense of mountains and of rivers
the factor of passiveness and also that defense maneuvers are highly
localized, and as the author says (Chapter Twenty), “there is always

something very insidious and dangerous about local defense.” Nevertheless,
there are also important differences. Swamps are usually much wider than
rivers, and also much more difficult to cross, especially with heavy
equipment. On the other hand, if a means of crossing is established, it is
much more difficult for the opponent to demolish than is a bridge across a
river. Clausewitz finally admits, apparently somewhat reluctantly, that wide
swamps and marshes “are among the strongest lines of defense possible.”

case of the Netherlands and their means of defense by inundation (the
Netherlands, after all, border on Prussia), the author goes on to consider the
defense of forests. The direct defense of a forest is risky, because the
defender needs above all to be able to see. To have a forest in front of him is
the worst of all situations, because the attacker can see without being seen,
but to have a forest in the defender’s rear may be an asset in retreat.

The cordon-defense may make sense when the object is to withstand a

slight attack—“slight either because the attacker is easily discouraged or
because the attacking force is small.” On the other hand, it would be really
absurd “if the main force, which is meant to defend the country, were to be
strung out in a long series of defensive posts against the enemy’s main force
—in fact, a cordon. It would be so absurd that one would have to
investigate the immediate circumstances which would accompany and
explain such an occurrence.”

on the very eve of its occurrence, was the kind of cordon-defense that
characterized virtually all of the First World War, especially on the western
front. What caused it to come into existence was (a) the enormously greater
size of the armies on both sides than had ever been mobilized before, and
(b) the equally striking increase in defensive firepower, especially because
of the machine gun. In the Second World War the tactical situation had
again changed, because of the heavy use of tanks and of tactical aircraft.
The enormous size of armies again made some degree of cordon defense
almost inevitable, but only during pauses between the main fighting efforts
were the lines relatively stationary.
  

Book Six, Chapters Twenty-Three-Twenty-Four: The brief Chapter

Twenty-three is almost a digression and notable only for the heavy scorn

with which Clausewitz exposes cant among his fellow theorists. In this case
the offending phrase is “key to the country,” which he calls an “incantation”
and its meaning “obviously something of a mystery, beyond the bounds of
normal understanding, and requiring the magic of the occult sciences.”
Moreover, he points to examples where the concept was responsible for
some senseless moves. “The real key to the enemy’s country,” he says, “is
usually his army.” Though he allows some justification for using the term to
denote “an area which one must hold before one can risk an advance into
enemy territory,” he prefers to reject the concept altogether.

The long chapter which follows considers the problem of strategic

defense by operations against the flank of an invading army. The issue is
presented most forcefully in considering the campaign to which Clausewitz
almost immediately refers, Napoleon’s march to Moscow in 1812; for apart
from the author’s personal experience with it, this campaign raises the
relevant questions in their most extreme form. How could it happen that
Napoleon could take so huge an army 600 miles deep into a hostile country,
while moving along a narrow front, confident that his line of
communications would not be seriously threatened? And indeed it was not,
at least during his advance. The number of troops that he had to assign to
guarding his communications as he proceeded was not large—as we have
learned in a previous chapter—being far smaller than the numbers lost
simply as stragglers (see Chapter Twelve of Book Five).

Clausewitz seems to have some difficulty himself in explaining the

matter on grounds other than experience. Even upon positing a case where a
superior army is attempting flanking operations against its opponent, he
says: “It would seem that the latter would be hard-pressed to protect its rear.
True enough, if only war were as predictable in practice as it is on paper!”
Well, obviously it is not, but, in this particular matter, why not?

First of all, he tells us, “forces sent to operate against the enemy’s rear

and flank are not available for use against his front.” In the usual case
where the defender does not enjoy superiority, as Kutuzov did not in falling
back before Napoleon, this is a vital consideration. Also, falling upon the
enemy’s communications is not much of an accomplishment in isolation.
What is there to strike, and for what purpose? Besides, good intelligence is
lacking, and “a party sent past the enemy’s wing to raid his rear is like a
man in a dark room with a gang of enemies.”

lacks either purpose or capability for advancing further—as was Napoleon’s
situation when he reached Moscow—the situation changes. “If the enemy is
blocked from making further progress by something other than our own
defense—no matter what it may be—we need no longer be afraid of
weakening our forces by sending out strong detachments. Even if the
enemy hopes to make us pay by launching an attack, we can simply yield
some ground and decline the battle,” as did the main Russian army before
Moscow.

Clausewitz distinguishes sharply between interfering with the enemy’s

communications, meaning mostly an occasional convoy or courier, and
cutting his line of retreat. The former may not mean much when the enemy
is advancing in great power. The latter may not mean much when he has no
intention of retreating. But when he has to think seriously of retreating or is
actually embarked upon a retreat, the situation changes drastically. Then
fear of being cut off, augmented by attacks and denial of provisions, may
induce desperation or panic.

campaign, “when the attack has spent its force,” and in conjunction with an
uprising of partisans (what Clausewitz calls “insurrection”). The latter do
not have to be spared from an army to which they do not belong.

enemy’s rear are mostly by aircraft, and in some instances partisans, and it
is still true that unless it is done in conjunction with major activity on the
fighting front, “interdiction” attacks accomplish little. Ground forces
advancing today usually do so on much broader fronts than in Clausewitz’s
time, and attacks on their flanks or rear will, therefore, have to be from
different forces than those they are pushing before them, as in the case of
Gallieni’s Paris garrison in 1914, and MacArthur’s Inchon landing in 1950.
However, such instances are rare.

When the Germans under Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941,

thereby apparently inviting a replay of Napoleon’s disaster of 1812, they
attacked on a broad front with great power, and the totally surprised Red
army, by offering battle near the frontiers, suffered tremendous losses in
prisoners as well as casualties. The Germans also visited such savage
treatment on the peoples of the conquered territories as to minimize through

terror partisan activities against their communications. Though in the end
the task proved too much for the Germans and the result was a disaster
comparable to Napoleon’s, it took almost three years instead of just a few
months for that result to be accomplished. And except for local enveloping
operations, the German rear was never significantly threatened.

German army against the French facing the Ardennes forest in May 1940
should in principle have proved vulnerable to attack on its flanks, but the
French army lacked the mobility, the reserve power, and, above all, the
spirit to counteract effectively. On the other hand, when the Germans did
the same thing in almost the same sector against the American army in
December 1944-the so-called Battle of the Bulge—the Americans and
British did have the power to strike decisively against the flanks of the deep
German salient, a power augmented, when the weather finally cleared, by
very heavy air attacks. The quick collapse of the German offensive proved
only that their objective was well beyond their means.
  

the Interior of the Country” Clausewitz analyzes in a somewhat generalized
fashion the Russian defensive campaign of 1812, from which he derives
most of his illustrations. The Russian defense, not pre-planned as such, took
the form “that destroys the enemy not so much by the sword as by his own
exertions.” It profited from the fact that the attacker’s strength always
diminishes as he advances, provided the retreat of the defender which both
invites and obliges that advance can be suffliciently deep. It is important
that the defender’s retreat not follow a severe defeat in battle, for then it is
likely to be more costly to him than to the invader, and this means not
accepting battle prematurely. The Russians were spared making that
mistake in 1812 not out of prescience but simply because the French were
so overwhelmingly superior in the early part of their advance.

The forces in retreat preempt local supplies as they move, using bridges

but destroying them in their wake, and carrying out generally what has
since come to be called “scorched earth” policy. Depending on the original
differences in strength and on various other factors the defender can
ultimately offer battle with much improved prospects of success. “Indeed,
the condition of the invader at the end of his course is often such that even a

victory can force him to retreat,” if he has used up reserves which he cannot
replenish.

of the loss of country to the invader, the importance of which depends on
how rich and how populated is the portion temporarily lost. The basic point,
however, is that “it cannot be the object of defense to protect the country
from losses; the object must be a favorable peace.” The second and usually
more important drawback is psychological. Normally the army and
population cannot be expected to “tell the difference between a planned
retreat and a backward stumble; still less can they be certain if a plan is a
wise one, based on anticipation of positive advantages, or whether it has
simply been dictated by fear of the enemy.” Then there are inevitable
considerations of national pride and of honor, requiring “that an enemy who
violates a frontier will be made to pay a penalty in blood.” Such
considerations compelled the Russians to accept battle at Borodino rather
than surrender Moscow without a fight, though by that time their inferiority
was much ameliorated. Thus, the commander’s major problem in a
prolonged retreat is to maintain not only the morale of the retreating force
but also the support of the people and perhaps also of the government.

An invasion of a large country requires not only numerical superiority

over the defender but a force large in absolute numbers—“One may be able
to march on Moscow with 500,000 men, but never with 50,000”—and that
increases the debilitating effect which a long march will impose on the
invader. The more ponderous mass moves more slowly and thus forfeits the
chance of overtaking and destroying the retreating army; the problems of
supply and billeting are increased; and the losses are proportionately greater
for each measure of distance covered.

army can determine the direction of movement of the invader, being by
itself both a bait and a threat, and he decides that much depends on specific
circumstances.

which Clausewitz observed in 1812? Motor-driven tanks, guns, and
vehicles of all kinds have of course made an enormous difference,
especially in the speed of penetration of an invading force, so have aircraft
and radio communications. But there are compensating costs in the huge

requirements of supply, especially of the liquid fuel by which all things
move. Contrasting markedly with the ponderous movement of the German
army in August 1914 in its abortive effort to execute the Schlieffen Plan
was the impetuous and wholly successful breakthrough against the French
in the spring of 1940, but the larger-scaled attack against the Russians a
year later ultimately failed, as we have seen, despite spectacular German
successes at the outset which brought about horrendous Russian losses. By
November 1941 the German army was deep in Russia over a vast front but
already panting desperately at the end of its long lines of supply, while the
Russians were bringing fresh troops from Siberia and beginning to achieve
local successes. In the following summer the Germans launched a strong
new offensive, especially in the south, but despite some anxious months for
the Russians and their western allies the Germans failed to achieve their
major objectives. Before the year 1942 was out their Sixth Army was
already encircled at Stalingrad and disaster was impending. Clausewitz was
vindicated by the events of 1941-1944, on a scale that he could hardly have
dreamed of, though the Russians could have done far better for themselves
in following his implied admonitions against a rigid defense at the frontier.
Similar lessons were underlined in other areas of that farthest-spread of all
wars, and on a much lesser scale in the Korean War of 1950-1953, and
again in the Vietnam War.

original about Mao Tse-tung’s strategic theories, which make much of the
concept of “protracted war,” is in fact an exploration of modes of waging a
strategic defensive akin to Clausewitz’s. Mao may indeed have got his
ideas, which enabled him to defeat the more numerous and vastly better
equipped forces of Chiang Kai-shek, from his reading of the ancient
Chinese strategist Sun Tzu (from whom there is indeed much to learn)
rather than from Clausewitz. Or it is possible that he developed his ideas
simply on the basis of his sturdy common sense. For it does not require
profound strategic insight to understand the uses and strength of the
strategic defensive under appropriate circumstances. It requires, on the
contrary, a perverse kind of teaching to cause one to scoff in principle at
defensive theories.
  

Clausewitz deals with a phenomenon new to Europe in his lifetime—a
result not so much of the French Revolution as of the Napoleonic wars.
Irrelevant to his purposes are the fears others are expressing about the
uprising of partisans being “legalized anarchy ... as much a threat to the
social order at home as it is to the enemy,” but he is interested in its military
value.

lend itself to major actions, closely compressed in time and space.”
However, given sufficient time and broad enemy exposure to its effects, “it
consumes the basic foundations of the enemy forces.” By itself the general
insurrection will not do much, but within the framework of a war conducted
by the regular army, its effects can be critical.

Clausewitz then lays down five conditions under which a general

uprising can be effective, all of them together describing the conditions of
the Peninsular War, which for some reason he does not mention. Despite the
newness of this kind of war in his time and thus the general lack of
experience, he clearly delineates its character and sets down its
requirements. “It does not matter much if a body of insurgents is defeated
and dispersed—that is what it is for—but it should not be allowed to go to
pieces through too many being killed, wounded, and taken prisoner: such
defeats would soon dampen its ardor.” However, he acknowledges himself
to be simply groping for the truth. This kind of war is new, and “those who
have been able to observe it for some time have not reported enough about
it.” The latter statement indicates that the risings of the people played little
if any part in the campaigns he personally observed, including that in
Russia in 1812, which was among other things too brief.

though he hinges his discussion of it upon the calling out of the home guard
after loss of a decisive battle. “Even after a defeat,” he says, “there is
always the possibility that one’s fortune can be turned by developing new
sources of internal strength, or through the natural decimation suffered by
all offensives in the long run, or by means of help from abroad. There will
always be time enough to die.” Then later: “No matter how small and
insignificant a state may be in comparison with its enemy, it must not
forsake these last efforts, or else one will conclude that its soul is dead.” In

this respect one thinks of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway in the
Second World War, and of the contrasting example of a France that perhaps
gave up too easily. But one thinks also of the France of 1870-1871, which
after the decisive defeat at Sedan that occurred only six weeks after the
outbreak of war continued to fight on, mostly through the raising of levées
en masse, until the capitulation of Paris some five months later.
Determining when a desperate resistance is the ultimate wisdom or on the
contrary is a futile waste of life is a question which also is not covered by
an airy formula—not even Clausewitz’s.
  

chapters deal with the single topic, defense of a theater of operations,
Clausewitz is not at his inspired best. Partly, it is a matter of his writing,
which verges occasionally on the obscure and sometimes on the tedious, but
it is more a matter of his having made his major points in previous chapters,
leaving to this place an accounting of some points which deserve also to be
covered.

always more important to preserve one’s armed forces and to destroy those
of the enemy than to hold on to territory. Though loss of territory will in the
long run weaken one’s capabilities, it will not usually do so “within the
decisive phase of the war.” However, the enemy forces will not always
present themselves in a way that will make a single decisive blow against
them possible. For one thing, the invaders may represent a coalition of
enemies invading from widely different directions. It is all very well to
argue for concentrating one’s own forces and attacking opposing forces in
turn, but that is not always certain to be accomplished. One may be
compelled to divide one’s forces. There are other problems, even where the
opponent is not multiple but singular. He may, for example, decline to
advance upon one’s ideally selected and well-prepared position, choosing
rather to bypass one’s own forces for a different objective. Or he may in
other ways compel the defender to assume the tactical offensive despite the
latter’s preference for fighting a defensive battle.

possibilities, offering for each some suggestions on how they may be dealt
with.

by some formulae, however meritorious the latter may be as general
propositions. Unfortunately his historical examples, taken so often from the
campaigns of Frederick the Great, will not help bring alive to the modern
reader some of the points he is making. In recent times we have seen
several instances when the commander-in-chief felt compelled to reject the
simplistic ideal in order to protect territories. The younger von Moltke, for
example, has been almost universally condemned for “vitiating” the
Schlieffen Plan by strengthening the southern part of the line facing France
and also by taking steps to guard against too deep a penetration of East
Prussia by the Russians. But his reasons were not frivolous, and one would
have to examine carefully and in detail his decisions against the
circumstances existing at the time to determine that he was mistaken. That,
at least, would be Clausewitz’s approach. Similarly, in the Second World
War Roosevelt and Churchill correctly decided shortly after Pearl Harbor
that they must jointly concentrate on defeating Germany first, but that did
not mean that they could let Japanese advances in the Pacific and in East
and Southeast Asia go unopposed. The formula of “concentration of force”
may represent the ideal, but not necessarily what is feasible or invariably
correct.

BOOK SEVEN: THE ATTACK

tentative, preliminary tone. It is not alone their brevity, for some of the brief
chapters in other books appear highly finished, and indeed the first chapter
of the present book, which is also the briefest, says in its two paragraphs all
that needs saying by way of transition between the preceding book and the
present one. But, apart from the unsatisfactory presentation of some of the
ideas, one notices the shorthand way in which illustrative campaigns are
merely noted at the end of Chapter Four and again in Chapter Seven, and of
course the footnote by Marie von Clausewitz at the end of Chapter Five
makes evident what is otherwise merely sensed. And we recall that in his
“Notice” of 1827 the author refers to the chapters of this book as existing in
“rough draft.”

The author observes that much of what would otherwise have to be said

about attack has already been stated or implied in the preceding book on
defense. However, there are some special features of attack which do not
directly arise from the defense. For one thing, where counterattack is an
inherent part of the defense, the offensive thrust is complete in itself.
Although need for defense does intrude into the offensive, it does so only as
a “necessary evil,” first, because the offensive thrust has to be interrupted
for periods of rest, during which defense takes over automatically; and
second, because the area left in the rear of the advancing forces is not
necessarily covered by the attack and may need special protection. In short,
defense is an impeding burden to the attack, “its original sin, its mortal
disease.”

Also, although the defense can be implemented by elements other than

the fighting forces—like fortresses, advantages of terrain, and even a
greater likelihood of gaining allies—the offense usually has to depend on its
fighting forces alone.

Chapter Four, “The Diminishing Force of the Attack,” has already been

covered in the preceding book, though the author here contributes an

itemization of seven ways in which the overall strength of the invading
force may be depleted in the advance. Chapter Five, “The Culminating
Point of the Attack,” merely states a subject which will be discussed in
greater depth later on. Chapter Six, however, “Destruction of the Enemy’s
Forces,” though also brief and tentative, presents some ideas that are both
new and significant. Repeating his own formula that destruction of the
enemy’s forces is the military objective, Clausewitz raises the question:
What do we mean by “destruction of enemy forces?” And, at what price?
These do not seem like striking questions until one recalls that few other
writers on strategy have thought to raise them, let alone attempt to answer
them. Clausewitz mentions four quite dissimilar ways in which one can
view the issue of “destruction of enemy forces,” and then mentions some
indirect ways of accomplishing this goal, like seizing a strip of territory or
an enemy fortress. He admits that such indirect means are generally
overrated, that they are tempting only because they cost so little, but then
adds significantly that they are “obviously preferable to pointless battles.”
By “pointless” he clearly means indecisive but costly. What is more
obvious than the need to consider price in the pursuit of some gain, whether
strategic or other? Yet his constant readiness to do so is not the least of the
qualities that distinguish Clausewitz from virtually all other writers in the
field.

useful point—that “a peculiarity of most offensive battles is doubt about the
enemy’s position,” which makes it all the more necessary to concentrate
one’s forces. It is for this reason that he urges attempting to outflank rather
than to envelop the enemy. This leaves a good deal unsaid about the
feasibility of outflanking an enemy whose position is not established, and
who presumably has taken precautions against being outflanked, but it does
at least signal Clausewitz’s distaste for frontal attacks.
  

Book Seven, Chapters Eight-Twenty: In these chapters the tone has

become somewhat less tentative but still cursory, still burdened by the
author’s feeling that inasmuch as this book is but the obverse of the
preceding book, most of what would need saying under the various chapter
headings on attack has already been said in the related chapters on defense.

However, though he does not wish to repeat himself unduly, he seems less
concerned about appearing occasionally inconsistent.

forgotten his previous low valuation of rivers for strategic defense. His very
first sentence reads: “A major river which cuts across the line of attack is a
great inconvenience to the attacker.” The inconsistency, however, is
superficial. He is at this point speaking more at the level of tactics than of
strategy, and one remembers that Clausewitz is not always careful to make
clear to which of those levels he is at the moment addressing himself. Later
he says that the defended river will actually favor the attacker “if the
defender makes the mistake of staking his whole future on this defense.” So
there is not much inconsistency after all. Also, Clausewitz is again
speaking, albeit somewhat obliquely, in terms of reasonable measure or
proportion. Thus, although “river crossings as such seldom present major
difficulties,” the attacker is likely to have “misgivings” about them “unless
a great decision is involved.” He had in the previous book spoken of the
width of the river and of available means of crossing as important factors to
consider; now he is also speaking of the issue at stake, which is again a
variable. One does not take large risks for modest ends.

In Chapters Nine and Ten the author is again expressing his deep

aversion to attacking an able enemy who is in a strong defensive position or
entrenched camp. Not only reason, he says, but “hundreds and thousands of
examples show that a well-prepared, well-manned, and well-defended
entrenchment must generally be considered as an impregnable point.” The
“thousands” must certainly be an exaggeration—unusual for Clausewitz—
but it shows how strong his feelings are on this matter. And that in view of
the armaments of his time, with muzzle-loading muskets so slow to reload!
The generals of the First World War could well have used some of this
caution.

a supplement to the related chapter of Book Six, there being even less
reason here to speak of inconsistency. Chapter Twelve, “Attack on
Cordons” is slight as well as brief, but the following chapter, “Maneuver” is
more interesting. The modern student reads and hears so much about
eighteenth-century armies (and fleets) maneuvering in the presence of each
other—the maneuvering being an apparent substitution for or at least

postponement of the fighting—that he cannot help but wonder what it was
all about. It was in large measure a by-product of the very short ranges of
the weaponry used, so that hostile forces could be in full view of each other
and still be quite uncommitted to battle. Engagement would require on one
side or the other the will to attack, which might await the development of
some clear advantage. Thus, in 1812 Wellington and Marshal Marmont
before Salamanca maneuvered for three weeks in sight of each other before
Wellington saw the opportunity prompting him to attack. Modern forces
will also maneuver for advantage, but an opponent in view will be within
range and thus firing and seeking cover. Clausewitz gives five possible
objectives for maneuver, but concludes that there can be no rules of any
kind that govern the value of the action other than possession of the same
superior military qualities that generally determine the outcome of a battle.

Chapter Fourteen, “Attacks on Swamps, Flooded Areas, and Forests,”

adds virtually nothing to what has been discussed under the same headings
in the previous book. The same could be said about the two chapters that
follow concerning attack on a theater of war, except that we find a comment
here and there that deserves special notice. For example, in Chapter Fifteen
the author refers again to the advantage that an army derives from the
knowledge that it is on the attacking side, but this time he is even more
explicit in calling the advantage “modest” and usually “much overrated.”
“It is short-lived and will not stand the test of serious trouble.” We have
already noticed (in Chapter Three of Book Six) how this view contrasts
with that of romanticists like Foch. There is also a somewhat confusing
paragraph about whether the attacker should ever divide his forces when he
is bent on a major decision; what seems at the beginning like a stern
injunction against it becomes within a few lines a license to do so under
certain circumstances, especially when enemy forces are also divided. It is a
pity that Clausewitz did not devote more space to this matter, on which
there is so much rigidity. We learn also that in his day a large army always
advanced on a front at least a day’s march in width, so that if its lines of
communication and retreat did not deviate too much from the perpendicular
the front itself would usually provide all the cover necessary to those lines
—a point which both supplements and clarifies the related discussion in
Chapter Twenty-Four of Book Six. More significant for modern times are
the statements in the last paragraph, again concerning the protection of the

attacker’s rear: “If everything is subordinated to the pressure of an
imminent major decision, the defender will have little scope for auxiliary
operations, and the attacker will therefore ordinarily not be in great danger.
But once the advance is over and the attacker gradually goes over to a state
of defense, the protection of the rear assumes increasing urgency and
importance.” Whatever campaigns Clausewitz was thinking of as he penned
these two sentences, they apply equally to campaigns of the Second World
War.

them—that in his own day might lie behind the temporary seizure of a strip
of territory or a fortress. It might be for a bargaining token in a peace
conference, but it might equally be for the sake of glory or honor, for
trophies, “and at times merely to satisfy a general’s ambition.” Sometimes it
is simply a kind of shadow-boxing; “as the attacker, one is after all bound to
do something”! Again, the difference between his own times and ours in
these respects would be mostly a matter of degree.

Chapter Eighteen, “Attack on Convoys,” also supplements and helps

clarify the mystery referred to in the discussion of Chapter Twenty-Four in
Book Six. Convoys carrying supplies to an army penetrating deep into
hostile territory seem so vulnerable, especially inasmuch as their escorts
appear to offer such meager protection. But, Clausewitz points out, it is
usually the strategic situation, not the tactical, which protects them.

insofar as it might apply to major forces, and was apparently already so in
Clausewitz’s own time, inasmuch as the only successful examples he offers
are from an earlier generation. It is curious that he spends so many pages on
the subject and so relatively few on the subject of the following chapter,
“Diversions,” which is timeless in its application. A successful diversion, he
says, must provoke the enemy to use more force in coping with it than one
uses oneself, and must thereby be of net benefit to the main objective.
However, he permits the term to be stretched to cover attacks where no
larger effort elsewhere is for the time being contemplated, in which case it
is not simply a feint but rather a limited and harassing operation on the
periphery of the enemy’s power in lieu of a greater one aimed at a decisive
result. For both meanings of the term we can find examples from all major
wars, certainly including the Second World War.

by itself. After a long chain of dated, abbreviated, or otherwise
unsatisfactory chapters, we come at last to one of basic importance, which
is also the concluding chapter of this book. It is one which Clausewitz has
earlier mentioned in anticipation, for the central issue with which it deals is
what he calls “the culminating point of victory.” There are times when an
invading army grows stronger as it advances, but usually the reverse is true,
for reasons which Clausewitz again outlines though he has in fact dwelt
upon them in some earlier chapters, especially of Book Five. Actually, one
notices some significant inconsistencies between the present and the
relevant earlier chapters, especially in what he says here about the heavy
requirements upon the invading army for protecting its rear and flanks and
in what he neglects to say here but has said earlier about losses due to
fatigue and sickness (see especially Chapter Twelve of Book Five).

be a “culminating point” at which the attacker is about to lose effective
superiority. To push beyond this point without a good chance of an
imminent favorable decision is dangerous. Thus, “every attack which does
not lead to peace must necessarily end up as a defense.” Also, it is likely to
be an awkward defensive position. And it is usually the generals of high
courage and enterprising spirit, normally deserving of so much credit, who
will overshoot the mark.

Clausewitz calls Napoleon the one who revolutionized war by pushing

his offensives to complete victory, but he refrains from mentioning the 1812
march to Moscow, which might be in the reader’s mind as a prime example
of “enterprising spirit” pushing too far. Apparently Clausewitz does not so
regard it. As he will point out in the last chapter of Book Eight, Napoleon’s
invasion of Russia was inevitably a commitment to going to Moscow—
unless the Czar did him the favor of accepting battle near the frontier, which
he was most unlikely to do in view of Napoleon’s overwhelming superiority
at that stage. As we shall see in that later chapter, the author attributes
Napoleon’s disaster not to going beyond the “culminating point” but to
some basic miscalculations.

It is not clear what modern campaigns Clausewitz would accept as

Japanese attacks in the western Pacific and in southeast Asia beginning in
December 1941? Japan was bound to reach the limits of her capabilities
before she could register a decision against her chief adversary, and her
strategy was therefore wrong from its basic conception—as Admiral
Isoroku Yamamoto had tried to warn his colleagues before they plunged.
Similarly, the German attempt to conquer the Soviet Union beginning in
1941 proved inherently beyond German capabilities, and thus the line of
maximum advance was hardly a “culminating point of victory,” the Soviet
government being as clearly determined as Alexander I not to negotiate a
peace.

Though the principle Clausewitz is describing in this chapter

undoubtedly holds good today, its application is bound to be affected by
some important differences in the way armies operate. In his day infantry
moved exclusively on foot, and in long forced marches the major losses
were from stragglers dropping out from exhaustion and sickness. The
moving army lived mostly off the land, and the wagon train attending it
needed to carry only a few days supplementary provisions plus munitions
enough so that it would not be disarmed by fighting a major battle. Thus the
supply problem, though certainly not insignificant, was also not the chief
cause of the steady drop in combat effectiveness as the army moved
forward. Today, the fatigue problem would be greatly lessened because of
the abundance of motor vehicles, but the supply problem would be
correspondingly increased. A swiftly moving army might temporarily
outrun its supplies, especially of liquid fuel, and its capacity to recover its
momentum would depend heavily on its total logistics capability and the
vulnerability of that capability to enemy attack from the air and otherwise.

Eisenhower has often been criticized for halting his headlong rush to the

east in the late summer of 1944 largely for fear that his tanks would run out
of fuel, and the pause did permit the retreating and disorganized Germans to
regroup and restore their battle line. But when the Germans counterattacked
in the Ardennes in December of that year their tanks did run out of fuel and
became sitting ducks to Allied air power. Eisenhower played it safe and
paid a price for doing so, but the price was an insurance against catastrophe.
He refused to outrun his “culminating point of victory,” and stopped to
prepare the base for a new offensive which did in fact end the war.

BOOK EIGHT : WAR PLANS

realm of pure gold. Book Seven was not exactly wandering in the
wilderness, but it dealt mostly with the specific and thus inevitably the
dated, and Clausewitz himself seemed to be eager to hurry through it. “We
now revert,” he says in opening Book Eight, “to warfare as a whole . . .
which means returning to the ideas put forward in Book One.” The crucial
area we are now entering, he tells us, is the central one “on which all other
threads converge”—and he admits to entering it with some diffidence. The
diffidence is warranted by the boldness of the concept, but the author will
again prove himself totally equal to the challenge. The intervening books
have also reflected the greatness of his mind and have carried us far forward
in our understanding both of the nature of war and of what distinguishes
Clausewitz from other writers on that subject, but it is primarily Books One
and Eight which give him the unique place he continues to hold and which
account for his claims on our attention today.

In his brief introduction he returns to a subject he has dwelt on in Book

One but which he feels worth some further reflection. If there is no
substitute for talent in the commander and if one of the marks of his talent
is his ability to see things simply, why indeed should we—and he —study
the theory of strategy and of war, which threatens always to lapse into
“dreary pedantry”? He tries again to help us with an answer: “Theory
should cast a steady light on all phenomena so that we can more easily
recognize and eliminate the weeds that always spring from ignorance, show
how one thing is related to another and keep the important and the
unimportant separate.” And so far as its effects on the commander are
concerned: “Theory cannot equip the mind with formulas for solving
problems, nor can it mark the narrow path on which the sole solution is
supposed to lie by planting a hedge of principles on either side. It can,
however, give the mind an insight into the great mass of phenomena and of
their relationships, then leave it free to rise into the higher realms of action.

There the mind can use its innate talents to capacity, combining them all to
seize on what is right and true—as though it were a response to the
immediate challenge rather than a product of thought.”

real war,” and presents in its first paragraph a priceless axiom: “No one
starts a war—or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so—without first
being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he
intends to conduct it.” What could be simpler and more obvious —and yet
so often disregarded!

concept of war and the concrete shape which war generally assumes. His
previous answers to this question, he acknowledges, were only partial ones.
There is in fact a vast array of factors, forces, and conditions in national
affairs which are affected by war. “Logic comes to a stop in this labyrinth;
and those men whose habit in great things and small is anyway to act on
particular dominating impressions or feelings rather than according to strict
logic are hardly aware of the confused, inconsistent, and ambiguous
situation in which they find themselves.” Some, including perhaps the man
in overall command, may see the objective clearly and the requirements for
achieving it, but the many will not. Energy to overcome the opposition of
the latter will often be lacking. Thus, war (until Clausewitz’s time) has
usually been “something incoherent and incomplete.” His contemporaries
would have wondered if there were ever any basis for the concept of
absolute war had Napoleon not demonstrated that it could be fairly closely
approximated.

the future, or must he as a theorist reckon also upon some return of the
“incoherence” which after all characterized most of the wars between
Alexander the Great and Napoleon? As he will say in the next chapter:
“When barriers which in fact consisted only in ignorance of what was
possible are broken down, it is not easy to build them up again.” On the
other hand, it would be presumptuous to assume that all wars will
henceforward be of the unfettered kind. Of war in the future: “We must
allow for natural inertia, for all the friction of its parts, for all the
inconsistency, imprecision, and timidity of man; and finally we must face
the fact that war in all its forms results from ideas, emotions, and conditions

prevailing at the time—and to be quite honest we must admit that this was
the case even when war assumed its absolute state under Bonaparte.”

mind was trying to penetrate was to contain wars reaching a degree of
“absoluteness” which the Napoleonic pattern only dimly foreshadowed, but
not all of them would be of that nature. As of this writing the United States
has but recently extricated itself from a war in Vietnam that had every
possible kind and degree of incoherence both of objective and of method.
  

two parts have their individual headings. Part A, “Interdependence of the
Parts in War,” approaches yet again from another angle the difference
between absolute war and those considerable modifications of the absolute
which have been observed in history. War consists of a host of interactions
and usually of a whole series of engagements. What, then, is the relation
between these separate parts? The more war approaches the absolute, the
more clear it is that the only result that counts is final victory. In such a war
a general must have with his first move “a clear idea of the goal on which
all lines are to converge.”

In the kind of wars that were so common in the eighteenth century and

earlier, however, the separate campaigns and actions were seldom directed
towards such an ultimate goal. In those wars it was “legitimate to pursue
minor advantages for their own sake and leave the future to itself.” Again,
Napoleon changed all that, but again we have to consider whether the
change must apply to all cases in the future. Clausewitz concludes that at
the outset of a war, “its character and scope should be determined on the
basis of the political probabilities,” and if those probabilities drive war
towards the absolute, it becomes imperative “not to take the first step
without considering the last.”

Part B, “Scale of the Military Objective and the Effort to be Made,”

follows directly from the question posed in Part A. Absolute war would
demand not only a unified purpose but also a total effort. However, in
actuality we see all kinds of factors which modify the effort. Again we have
to consider the scale of political demands on either side, and also the fact
that the contenders have quite different characteristics as well as different
degrees of power. Thus, for a variety of reasons, both sides are not likely to

exert themselves to the same degree. A dilemma arises, however, from the
fact that “in war too small an effort can result not just in failure but in
positive harm.” This factor tends to push one toward maximum effort, but
in such a case “all proportion between action and political demands would
be lost,” which would obviously be irrational and hence unacceptable. What
is required, then, is “the faculty of using judgment to detect the most
important and decisive elements in the vast array of facts and situations.”

The prescription which follows reminds one again of the problem the

United States faced in Vietnam: “To discover how much of our resources
must be mobilized for war, we must first examine our own political aim and
that of the enemy. We must gauge the strength and situation of the opposing
state. We must gauge the character and abilities of its government and
people and do the same in regard to our own. Finally, we must evaluate the
political sympathies of other states and the effect the war may have on
them.” Clausewitz admits that rapid and correct appraisal of all these
factors and their ramifications “clearly calls for the intuition of a genius.”
But again he warns that “the vast, unique importance of war, while not
increasing the complexity and difficulty of the problem, does increase the
value of the correct solution.”

relevant changes in war from the times of Rome and of Alexander to his
own time. Clausewitz here reveals his wide and thorough grasp of political
as well as military history. It is an austerely condensed intellectual tour-
deforce. Perhaps the most telling part is that where the author describes the
changes that have occurred within his own lifetime, in which he raises again
the question: what does this mean about the future? The chapter ends with
the following summation: “The aims a belligerent adopts, and the resources
he employs, must be governed by the particular characteristics of his own
position; but they will also conform to the spirit of the age and to its general
character. Finally, they must always be governed by the general conclusions
to be drawn from the nature of war itself.”
  

Book Eight, Chapters Four-Five: These two chapters share a common

title, “Closer Definition of the Military Objective,” Chapter Four being
concerned with what it really means “to defeat the enemy,” and Chapter

army, and if feasible it is always “the best way to begin.” However, there
may be circumstances which modify this simple axiom. “One must keep the
dominant characteristics of both belligerents in mind. Out of these
characteristics a certain center of gravity is formed, the hub of all power
and movement, on which all depends. That is the point against which all our
energies should be directed.” Thus, seizing the enemy’s capital may
sometimes be more significant than destroying his army, and if the enemy
has a stronger ally an effective blow against that ally may carry one’s
purpose further than dealing with the weaker party. “If we can vanquish all
our enemies by defeating one of them, that defeat must be the main
objective of the war.”

of the enemy. To do so requires forces adequate to scoring a decisive
victory over the enemy’s and to pursuing our victory “to the point where the
balance is beyond all possible redress.” But Clausewitz also adds a political
requirement: “We must be certain our political position is so sound that this
success will not bring in further enemies against us who could force us
immediately to abandon our efforts against our first opponent.”

The author stresses the importance of momentum. Time tends usually to

favor the side that has suffered the first defeats, partly because its plight
may alarm other states and prompt them to come in on its side. Also, there
will, at best, be insufficient time to derive military benefit from the
territories that have been conquered. Thus, the conquest must be carried
through as quickly as possible, and not in stages but by one continuous
advance.

Clausewitz’s insistence on the latter point is clearly a reaction against the

kind of highly patterned procedures generally followed in pre-Napoleonic
times, and he argues that pauses are likely to be at least as favorable for the
partially defeated opponent as for oneself. “Our belief, then, is that any kind
of interruption, pause, or suspension of activity is inconsistent with the
nature of offensive war. When they are unavoidable they must be regarded
as necessary evils, which make success not more but less certain.”

time. In one place he says: “Given the way in which armies today are
supplied, they need depots more when halted than when on the move.” His
argument would have to be much modified for recent wars, when advancing
armies have been heavily dependent upon a constant stream of supplies,
especially of liquid fuel. As we have seen from some examples in the
Second World War, even though a pause in the advance will be exploited by
the retreating side, the side on the offensive is sometimes compelled to it by
the supply situation, or sometimes by the need to broaden its front or
otherwise consolidate its position. Even the defeat of France in 1940 was
not accomplished by a single German thrust but was actually done in two
main stages. Thus, the uninterrupted offensive should be regarded as the
ideal which today must sometimes be compromised in practice.

to be done if circumstances rule out defeat of the enemy. The discussion
seems based on the premise that the option of avoiding the war altogether is
ruled out. The choice, he says, is between seizing a portion of the enemy’s
territory and holding on to it, or attempting to hold on to one’s own “until
things take a better turn.” But the latter phrase implies that there are
grounds for expecting this to happen. The second possibility is that the
future affords better prospects to the enemy than it does to us. In that case,
Clausewitz argues, one must take the offensive, which means “exploiting
the advantages of the moment.” The third possibility, and the most usual,
“arises when the future seems to promise nothing definite to either side and
hence affords no ground for a decision.” In that case the offensive should be
taken by the side which possesses the political initiative, which is to say by
the side which had an active purpose or aim for which it went to war.

The second of the three possibilities just mentioned fits the case of Japan

choosing to go to war against the United States in 1941, not because its
leaders thought they had the means to win but because they felt they could
not afford to wait. Time was against them, mostly due to the American oil
embargo, imposed by President Roosevelt in 1940, which directly affected
the fuel reserves of the Japanese fleet. The results for Japan of accepting a
“now or never” option suggest something of the perils of this course of
action.

The fact that time appears to be on the side of the opponent does not itself
indicate that one can defeat him now. It is interesting that Lenin, who like
Engels studied Clausewitz, made much of this point; in his precepts to his
followers he repeatedly rejected the “now or never” philosophy wherever
the “now” was still an unfavorable situation for offensive action.136

Clausewitz, on the other hand, adhering to the “now or never” philosophy,
was in despair in 1809 because his sovereign, Frederick William III, refused
in the absence of Russian support to go to Austria’s aid against Napoleon in
the campaign that ended with Wagram; and when the king two years later
chose again not to fight Napoleon but to accept a limited alliance with him
in anticipation of the latter’s invasion of Russia, Clausewitz fulminated in a
letter to a friend: “One is obliged to undertake an operation against chance
of success when it is impossible to do anything else.” By “impossible” he
probably meant “dishonorable,” but possibly also “missing an opportunity.”
Clausewitz then left the Prussian service to enter that of Russia, soon to be
the nominal enemy of his own king. However correct his personal action in
view of his abhorrence of Napoleon, his attitude about what the Prussian
state ought to do was colored by a certain romanticism. Prussia, with its
army reduced by the terms of the peace of 1806, had not the slightest
chance of withstanding the armies of Napoleon, and the king’s decision
turned out in the end to be the wisest for the interests of the state.
  

Book Eight, Chapter Six: This important chapter is pitched on the heroic

level—at least after one gets through Part A, with the subtitle “The Effect of
the Political Aim on the Military Objective,” which provides in advance
some illustrations of what the author means to say in Part B but which
carries little meaning in itself. We therefore go immediately to Part B, with
its pregnant subtitle, “War As An Instrument of Policy.” Here we have a
return to the argument of the great opening chapter of Book One, where we
first encountered the doctrine that “war is a continuation of policy by other
means.” Now we have an additional illumination of the meaning of that
now famous phrase, with some elucidation of its ramifications. We must,
however, also recall that Clausewitz planned considerably further
development of the idea in his proposed revision.

Absolutely inadmissible, he says, is the common notion that war

suspends political intercourse between the contestants and replaces it with a
wholly different condition, ruled by no law but its own. War may have its
own grammar, but not its own logic. The logic is determined by the political
aim, and acts of war merely replace the usual exchange of diplomatic notes.
If this were not so, war would be “something pointless and devoid of
sense.”

precisely that “it cannot follow its own laws but has to be treated as a part
of some other whole, the name of which is policy.” However, if war is part
of policy, then policy must determine its character. That does not mean it
will influence operational details—“political considerations do not
determine the posting of guards or the employment of patrols”—but it will
influence “the planning of the war, of the campaign, and often even of the
battle.” And somewhat later: “Under no circumstances can the art of war be
regarded as the preceptor of policy.”

The point is too important to worry about repetition, and Clausewitz

keeps hammering at it: “That the political view should wholly cease to
count on the outbreak of war is hardly conceivable unless pure hatred made
every war a struggle for life or death.” And again, “Policy is the guiding
intelligence and war only the instrument, and not vice versa.” The military
point of view, then, must always be subordinated to the political.

do not use it incorrectly. However, if that happens it is the policy that is
wrong, not the fact that policy is influencing the war. But if the political
leader is a man of distinguished intelligence and strength of character, he
can always get the military information he needs “somehow or other.”
Apparently Clausewitz thought the reverse to be unlikely, or at any rate not
appropriate.

the wars of the Napoleonic era arose from “the new political life which the
revolution created for Europe as well as for France. Other means and forces
were thus called forth, which conferred on warfare a degree of energy
inconceivable without them.” And then: “It follows that the transformation
of the art of war resulted from the transformation of politics.”

fervor which stems from his conviction that nothing he has been saying
throughout his whole work is more important or more basic—or more likely
to be ignored. The First World War was conspicuously not fought according
to these precepts. But Clausewitz did not deny that war could become
“something pointless and devoid of sense.” He only argued that it should
not.

common title “The Limited Aim,” are much below the high level
established in Chapter Six. For one thing, they are dated in a way that the
previous chapter was not. It appears also that Clausewitz is not happy with
the premises he establishes for these chapters, which are basically twofold:
the expressed premise that one lacks the means to impose a decisive defeat
on the enemy, and the implied premise that one is nevertheless not too
grossly inferior to him. Under those conditions one may still (Chapter
Seven) offensively seize a portion of the enemy’s territory, thereby reducing
his national resources and holding in one’s own hand an asset for the peace
negotiations. The important question in this case is whether there is a good
chance of holding on to the territory for the remainder of the war, and if not,
whether temporary occupation would be worth what the occupation costs.
“In general,” Clausewitz says, “one tends to lose more from occupation by
the enemy than one gains from occupying his territory, even if the value of
both areas should be identical.” More important, in assuming the defensive
over a larger area, one surrenders the initiative without having ever
attempted a critical blow at the heart of the enemy’s power. Clausewitz
seems at this point to be drifting away from his primary premise, and he
finishes this chapter with a reaffirmation of how noble it is to be willing to
accept large risks.

defense, where the main object is to gain time while keeping as much as
possible of one’s territory out of enemy hands. One can resort to beating off
attacks wherever they occur, and can even undertake minor offensive
operations in the form of raids or diversions, but only if the basically
defensive purpose is not compromised. The purpose of bidding for time is
to await political changes, such as the enemy’s wearying of his effort, or of
allies adhering to one’s own side or departing that of the enemy.

strength that one becomes superior to him a counter-offensive is naturally in
order. At this point Clausewitz shifts away from examples describing
Frederick the Great’s strategy to still another consideration of the 1812
campaign, and he offers us a revealing observation: “The highest wisdom
could never have devised a better strategy than the one which the Russians
happened to follow” (italics added). Clausewitz was throughout that
campaign in a good position to know.

We presume to call these chapters dated partly because Clausewitz

himself considered them already to be so in his time. After describing
Frederick’s successful defensive strategies, he observes: “But one must
remember that times have changed, that war has undergone a total
transformation and now draws its life from wholly different sources.
Positions which have lost all value in our time could be effective then; and
the enemy’s general character was a factor as well.” The latter remark refers
to the lack of aggressiveness of Frederick’s opponents. The Russian
example, which Clausewitz did not consider dated, refers, of course, to a
very large country. As we have seen, for the same reason it would not be
dated even today.
  

Plan of a War Designed to Lead to the Total Defeat of the Enemy,” returns
to the monumental scope of Chapter Six. But where Chapter Six
concentrates on the level of statesmanship, Chapter Nine focuses on the
level of grand military strategy. The object laid down in the chapter title is
clearly more congenial to the author’s spirit than that of the two chapters
immediately preceding, and we encounter an epitome of the military ideas
considered typically Clausewitzian.

Having with little wavering disavowed thus far any allegiance to

“principles” as firm guides to action, the author starts this chapter by
indulging in the enunciation of two. The first principle is to act with the
utmost concentration of aim and of force, and the second is to act with the
utmost speed. This does not mean that forces must never be divided both in
space and in mission, and Clausewitz proceeds to investigate in depth four
basic reasons for dividing them. The reasons in each case must be strong
ones, to be weighed circumspectly against the primary demand for

concentration. Neverthless, it is characteristic of Clausewitz to be exploring
exceptions even to his most favored rules.

well. Again there are likely to be exceptions, but in any case each minor
operation embarked upon must be kept as subordinate as possible.

As he develops these points one suddenly notices that Clausewitz is

laying down the intellectual framework of what nearly a century later will
be the famous Schlieffen Plan. There are times he says, when “two almost
wholly separate wars have to be fought simultaneously. Even then one must
be treated as the main operation, calling for the bulk of resources and of
activities. Seen in this light, it is advisable to operate offensively only in this
main theater and to stay on the defensive elsewhere. There an attack will be
justified only if exceptional conditions should invite it. The defensive at the
minor points, moreover, should be maintained with the minimum of
strength; and every advantage which that form of resistance offers should
be turned to account.” This concept describes the German division of forces
between the eastern and western fronts in August 1914, and also the
division of forces along the western front itself. But he goes on, concerning
the enemy who is the target of the main offensive: “The main decision is
what matters. It will compensate for any loss. If there are sufficient forces
to make it reasonable to seek a major decision, then the possibility of failure
can no longer be an excuse for trying to cover oneself everywhere else. For
this would make defeat in the decisive battle that much more probable.”

In the same vein he returns to his second principle which is that of speed.

“Almost the only advantage of attack,” he says, “rests on its initial surprise.
Speed and impetus are its strongest elements and are usually indispensable
if we are to defeat the enemy.” Another advantage of speed is that it will
bring one quickly into the heart of the enemy country, for though a victory
is easier to achieve if the battle is fought near one’s own frontiers, it is more
likely to be decisive in its effect if it is fought deep in enemy territory. And
if we are talking about the complete defeat of the enemy, “such a victory
demands an enveloping attack or a battle with reversed fronts.” And
naturally such a victory must be followed by unrelenting pursuit.

Belgium in 1914), we must invest them with the smallest possible forces.
“From the moment when the siege of fortresses compels us to suspend the

advance, the offensive has as a rule reached its culminating point. Therefore
we demand that the main force should go on advancing rapidly and keep up
the pressure.” And one must not worry about the front of advance being too
narrow so long as the momentum is continued: “So long as the general has
not yet defeated the enemy, so long as he believes himself to be strong
enough to gain his objectives, he must persevere. He may do so with
increasing danger, but his success will be all the greater. Should he reach a
point beyond which he dare not go, should he feel he must expand to right
and left in order to protect his rear—so be it: very likely his attack has
reached its culminating point. Its momentum is exhausted ; and if the
enemy is still unbroken there is probably no future in it anyway.”

which we have only outlined here, is too detailed and too sharply
distinguished from the ideas of other writers to be an accident, especially
inasmuch as we know that Schlieffen was a keen student of Clausewitz.

Russia, the failure of which, the author is constrained to show, was not due
to the advance being too fast and too far. Nor was his going to Moscow a
mistake. “Only if he could reach Moscow in strength could Bonaparte hope
to shake the government’s nerve and the people’s loyalty and
steadfastness.” The campaign failed “because the Russian government kept
its nerve and the people remained loyal and steadfast.” The outcome shows
that Napoleon miscalculated. It may have been wrong for him to risk such a
miscalculation, but his estimate of how the government and people would
react to his taking Moscow was not so predictably wrong as to make the
campaign an absurdity. If Napoleon’s army was punished more severely
than it need have been, the fault which can be laid to him was not in the
depth to which he penetrated Russia. “It lay in his being late in starting the
campaign, in the lives he squandered by his tactics, his neglect of matters of
supply and of retreat,” and in his staying too long in Moscow.

as other events: “It is legitimate to judge an event by its outcome, for this is
its soundest criterion. But a judgment based on the result alone must not be
passed off as evidence of human wisdom.... Anyone who asserts that the
campaign of 1812 was an absurdity because of its enormous failure, but
who would have called it a superb idea if it had worked, shows complete

lack of judgment.” In other words, there is never only one reason for
success or for failure, and good critical judgment must take account of the
several important reasons for each.

objective being made by widely separated armies as distinct from a single
concentrated attack. Clausewitz prefers the latter, but the former “may be
imposed by circumstances which one cannot alter.” The author is of course
talking about an era which knew nothing of modem electronic
communications, but the wisdom he brings to his problem is none the less
piquant. If forces are operating in different theaters, perhaps widely
separated, against a common enemy, they should not worry too much about
smoothly coordinating their efforts. “The smooth coordination of every part
of the action from start to finish is not even necessary in tactics, let alone
strategy.” Each of the separated forces should therefore be given an
independent task. Actually, even in modern times this advice still holds.

1703—in which Clausewitz participated as a boy ensign of thirteen
—“Prussia had nothing either to defend or conquer in Alsace.” The
discovery that this province was a long-lost part of Germany was to come
much later. We also notice, perhaps with surprise, that in the campaigns of
1813-1814, the Russian Czar did not insist on his army operating
independently but put his forces, at the level of individual corps, under
Prussian and Austrian commanders.

paragraphs of summary about plans aimed at the total defeat of the enemy,
where he says in part: “We would emphasize the essential and general;
leave scope for the individual and accidental; but remove everything
arbitary, unsubstantiated, trivial, far-fetched, or supersubtle. . .. Should
anyone be shocked at finding nothing here about how to turn a river,
command a mountain area from its heights, by-pass a strong position or find
the key to a whole country, he has failed to grasp our purpose; we are
afraid, moreover, that he has still not understood the essential elements of
war. In previous books we have dealt with these details in a general way,
and reached the conclusion that they are apt to be a great deal less important
than is usually thought.”

she should “resume that insolent behavior that has been the curse of Europe
for a hundred and fifty years”—is interesting but of no real significance
except for what it says about armies invading separately from different
theaters, and the paragraph which again calls to mind the Schlieffen Plan:
“The center of gravity of France lies in the armed forces and in Paris.... The
most vulnerable area of France is that between Paris and Brussels, where
the frontier is only 150 miles from the capital.”

Much of the older literature on the different phases of the writing of On War
is based on inadequate sources and can be disregarded. Still valuable today
is the short book by R. v. Caemmerer, Clausewitz (Berlin, 1905), and the
suggestive article by H. Rosinski, “Die Entwicklung von Clausewitz’ Werk
‘Vom Kriege’ im Lichte seiner ‘Vorreden’ und ‘Nachrichten,’ ” Historische
Zeitschrift, 151 (1935), pp. 278-293, which was amended in important
respects by E. Kessel’s response “Zur Entstehungsgeschichte von
Clausewitz’ Werk vom Kriege,” Historische Zeitschrift, 152 (1935), pp. 97-
100. W. M. Schering’s speculations in his anthology of Clausewitz’s
writings, Geist und Tat (Stuttgart, 1941), are full of contradictions and
factual errors; but since Schering was familiar with Clausewitz’s
unpublished drafts and seems to have been the last scholar to work on them
before they disappeared at the end of the Second World War, his
interpretations cannot be ignored. In a knowledgeable essay “Clausewitz,”
in Makers of Modern Strategy, ed. E. M. Earle (Princeton, 1943), pp. 93-
113, H. Rothfels writes (p. 108, n. 65): “Clausewitz revised Book Eight and
parts at least of Book One (probably Chapters One-Three) and of Book Two
(certainly Chapter Two).” But he adds that Clausewitz regarded only Book
One, Chapter One as complete. I believe that Rothfels considerably
overstates the extent of Clausewitz’s revisions after 1827. He gives no
reason for his views other than internal evidence, but the passage from
Book Eight he cites as proof of a late revision can be found in almost
identical form in Clausewitz’s manuscript on strategy of 1804. The best-
informed evaluation of the entire question, incorporating the findings of a
century of scholarship, is contained in E. Kessel’s brilliant “Zur Genesis der
modernen Kriegslehre,” Wehrwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 3 (1953), no. 9,
pp. 405-423.

Any interpretation of the genesis of Clausewitz’s thought on war must rest
not only on his works on military theory and history but also on his
extensive writings on such subjects as education, politics, the theory of art,
and on his correspondence. Especially valuable analyses of aspects of his
broad intellectual development are H. Rothfels’ Carl von Clausewitz:
Politik und Krieg (Berlin, 1920), and E. Kessel’s introduction to C. v.
Clausewitz, Strategie aus dem Jahr 1804 (Hamburg, 1937). Primary and

secondary sources are discussed in detail in my book, Clausewitz and the
State (New York, 1976), on which much of the following is based.

C. v. Clausewitz to C. v. Roeder, 22 December 1827, in Zwei Briefe des
Cenerals von Clausewitz, special issue of the Militärwissenschaftliche
Rundschau, 2 (March 1937), p. 6. English edition forthcoming.

[C. v. Clausewitz], “Bemerkungen über die reine und angewandte Strategic
des Herrn von Bülow,” Neue Bellona, 9 (1805), no. 3, p. 276.

In his addition to his essay “On Abstract Principles of Strategy,” a later
addition to his manuscript on strategy of 1804, printed in Strategie aus dem
Jahr 1804, pp. 71-73.

See for instance his essay “On the State of Military Theory,” written in his
twenties, which opens with the declaration that contrary to the belief of
some writers the art of war had not yet attained perfection: “Any scientific
discipline—unless like logic it is complete unto itself—must always be
capable of growth, of constant accretion. In any event it is not all that easy
to set limits to the human intellect.” Geist und Tat, p. 52.

The study, “Gustav Adolphs Feldzüge von 1630-1632,” some hundred
pages long, was published in 1837 in volume 9 of Clausewitz’s collected
works, Hinterlassene Werke des Generals Carl von Clausewitz, 10 vols.
(Berlin, 1832-1837).

the reform period.

The essay, “Die wichtigsten Grundsätze des Kriegführens . . . ,” has been
brought out in English by H. Gatzke under the somewhat misleading title
Principles of War (Harrisburg, Pa., 1942). For the following quotations,
which are in my translation, compare Gatzke, pp. 60-61, 67.

M. v. Clausewitz, “Preface,” On War. The quotation from her husband
appears on p. 63. In time of writing this is the second of four introductory
notes by Clausewitz to On War. The first, “Author’s Preface,” dates from
1816 to 1818, and refers to the essays Clausewitz was writing in those years
(pp. 61-62). The second, included in his wife’s preface, refers to the
expansion of the original scheme. The third, dated 10 July 1827, constitutes
the first half of the “Notice,” and mentions Clausewitz’s plan for a complete
revision of Books One to Six, and of the sketches for Books Seven to Eight
(pp. 69-70). The second part of the “Notice” was written later, possibly in
1830, and indicates that Clausewitz had not progressed very far with his
revision (pp. 70-71).

That this is not the case with many military writers, particularly those who
have tried to deal with war scientifically, is shown by the many instances
when the pros and cons of their reasoning dispose of one another so
completely that, unlike the two lions in the fable, not even their tails are
left. Clausewitz, hereafter cited Cl.

See the Preface by Marie von Clausewitz on p. 66 below. Editors, hereafter
cited Eds.

Marie von Clausewitz had been appointed Governess of Prince Friedrich
Wilhelm, the later Emperor Frederick III. Eds.

Clausewitz means Chapter Two. Eds.

In German: Evolution. This signifies the deployment of troops within battle
as opposed to general operational maneuvers. Eds.

The armed forces. Eds.

Then reference is to Clausewitz’s contemporary, H. D. v. Bülow. See P.
Paret, “The Genesis of On War”, p. 10 above. Eds.

The German word Methodismus has no precise English equivalent. Eds.

The German term Kritik here means “critique, critical analysis, evaluation,
and interpretation” rather than “criticism.” Eds.

The definition is in fact first stated in Book Two, Chapter One, see p. 128
above. Eds.

Book One is meant. Eds.

The same man who shines at the second level is eclipsed at the top. Eds.

We immediately think of Tempelhoff and Montalembert: the former in a
passage on page 148 of the first part of his work, the latter in a reference in
his “Correspondance” to the Russian plan of Operations for 1759. Cl.
Clausewitz refers to Tempelhoff’s German version of Henry Lloyd’s History
of the Late War in Germany: Geschichte des Siebenjdhrigen Krieges in
Deutschland, 1783-1801; and to the Correspondance de Mr. le marquis de
Montalembert, 1777. Eds.

Tempelhoff, Der Veteran, Frederick the Great. Cl. Der Veteran refers either
to a collection of articles with that title, or more likely to the memoirs of an
Austrian officer who served in the Seven Years War, Jacob de Cogniazo,
Geständnisse eines östereichischen Veteranen, Breslau, 1781-91. Eds.

Sic. This point is discussed not in Chapter Five of Book Two but in Chapter
One of Book One, pp. 81-85 above. Eds.

Sic. See previous note, p. 216 above. Eds.

Clausewitz himself had predicted in 1804 that if Napoleon ever invaded
Russia he would be defeated. P. Paret, Clausewitz and the State (New York,
1976), p. 224. Eds.

Waterloo. Eds.

Relative Vertheidigung, literally “relative defense,” obviously means
“delaying action” here. Eds.

I.e., de Beaurain, Histoire militaire de Flandre (Paris, 1755). Eds.

Book Five is meant. Eds.

There is no Book Nine. Eds.

Chapter Five is meant. Eds.

All of these figures are taken from Chambray. C1.

Chapter Eight is meant. Eds.

This refers to the work of Heinrich von Bülow. See above, Peter Paret, “The
Genesis of On War”, p. 10. Eds.

Anyone who has learned his strategy from Herr von Bülow will not
understand how it is that we have simply left out the whole of Bülow’s
teaching. But it is not our fault if Bülow deals with minor matters only. An
office boy would be just as puzzled if he searched the index of an arithmetic
book and found no entry for such practical rules as the rules of three or five.
But Herr von Bülow’s opinions can hardly be counted as practical rules. We
have made the comparison for other reasons. CI.

The German term is Überfall (surprise attack), which Clausewitz here
employs in a general sense. Eds.

Frederick the Great. Eds.

Philippsburg was a perfect example of how not to site a fortress. Its location
was that of an idiot standing with his nose against the wall. Cl.

In 1759 Frederick replaced the commander of the Prussian corps operating
against the Russians with Karl Heinrich v. Wedel. Since Wedel was junior
to other generals in the corps, Frederick wrote a letter that confirmed his
supreme authority: “He, Lieutenant-General v. Wedel, represents in the
army what a Dictator represented in Roman times.” Wedel’s position at
Züllichau prevented the Russians from crossing the Oder there, but they
threatened a crossing further north, and when Wedel, though outnumbered
two to one, attacked them at Kay on 23 July, he was badly defeated. Eds.

No such chapter appears in the book. Eds.

I.e., Kay. See the note on p. 438 above. Eds.

The manuscript concludes with the passage: “Development of this subjects
after Book Three, in the essay on the culminating point of victory.”

An essay by that title has been found in a folder marked “Various Essays:

Materials [for a revision of the manuscript].” It appears to be an expansion
of the chapter that is merely outlined here, and is printed at the end of Book
Seven. Marie von Clausewitz.

The first edition has Gefahr, which makes no sense. The second edition
tries to make sense by an inappropriate insertion. For Gefahr we read Zahl.
Eds.

Although all texts consulted give weniger gesammelten, this paragraph
makes sense only on the assumption that weniger should read mehr, and we
translate accordingly. Eds.

See above, Book Five, Chapter Seven. Eds.

The first edition is so obscure that we here follow the text of the second.
Eds.

This translates the word erste, as given in the first edition. Subsequent
editions, however, give ernste: “the determined plan of an attacker, etc.”

Eds.

Compare Chapters Four and Five above, and note on p. 528. Eds.

Book Three, Chapter Sixteen. Eds.

The German has 1798, which obviously is a misprint. Eds.

See Chapter One, Book One. Cl.

See Chapter Two, Book One. Cl.

See Chapters Four and Five, Book Seven. Cl.

If Frederick had won the battle of Kolin and in consequence had captured
the main Austrian army in Prague with both its senior commanders, it
would indeed have been such a shattering blow that he might well have
thought of pressing on to Vienna, shaking the foundations of the monarchy
and imposing peace. That would have been an unparalleled success for
those days, as great as the triumphs of the Napoleonic wars, but still more
wonderful and brilliant for the disparity in size between the Prussian David
and the Austrian Goliath. Victory at Kolin would almost certainly have
made this success possible. But that does not invalidate the assertion made
above, which only concerned the original purpose of the King’s offensive.
To surround and capture the enemy’s main army, on the other hand, was
something wholly unprovided for and the King had never given it a thought
—at least until the Austrians invited it by the inadequate position they took
up at Prague. Cl.

The first edition has: “so bleibt ... nur ein gutes Mittel übrig, nämlich den
obersten Feldherm zum Mitglied des Kabinets zu machen, damit dasselbe
Theil an den Hauptmomenten seines Handelns nehme.” In the second
edition, which appeared in 1853, the last part of the sentence was changed
to: “damit er in den wichtigsten Momenten an dessen Beratungen und
Beschlüssen teilnehme.” In his 1943 translation, based on the second or on
a still later edition, O.J.M. Jolles rendered this alteration correctly as: “that

he may take part in its councils and decisions on important occasions.”
That, of course, is a reversal of Clausewitz’s original sense. By writing that
the commander-in-chief must become a member of the cabinet so that the
cabinet can share in the major aspects of his activities, Clausewitz
emphasizes the cabinet’s participation in military decisions, not the soldier’s
participation in political decisions.

Of the several hundred alterations of the text that were introduced in the

second edition of On War, and became generally accepted, this is probably
the most significant change. Eds.

Book Seven, Chapter Five. Eds.

The first edition omits the phrase die Franzosen, dann gegen which appears
in later editions and seems necessary to give point to Clausewitz’s
comment. Eds.

French author, and confidant of Frederick, who resided in Prussia during the
Seven Years War. Eds.

St. Petersburg. Eds.

Book Seven, Chapter Three. Eds.

The chapter was never written. Eds.

Here we follow the text of the second edition since that of the first appears
hopelessly corrupt. Eds.

The chapter was never written. Eds.

During the great battle Clausewitz was nearly sacrificed to Blücher’s spirit
and to the strategic insight of the latter’s chief of staff, General von
Gneisenau, who was Clausewitz’s friend and sponsor. Responding
wholeheartedly to Wellington’s appeal for assistance, Blücher left behind at
Wavre, some fourteen miles east of Waterloo, only General von
Thielmann’s corps (with Clausewitz) to confront Marshal Grouchy. When
the latter proved of greatly superior strength, Thielmann sent urgently after
his chief for reinforcements; but Gneisenau, then approaching Waterloo,
turned him down with the words, “It doesn’t matter if he’s crushed so long
as we gain the victory here.”
